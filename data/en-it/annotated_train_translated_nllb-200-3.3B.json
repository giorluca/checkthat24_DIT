Diocese of Madison has confirmed several of my children according to the traditional Rite of Confirmation, as his diocese has been a port in the storm for many displaced and disillusioned Catholic families. We don’t see eye-to-eye on everything, of course, but his faith and pastoral solicitude have for us been a light in the darkness and proof that God has not left us orphans. And now this, finally, a bishop with the courage to look the beast in the eye and speak its name out loud. Bishop Morlino does this in a moment when he is under heavy attack as a “hater” for defending the Church’s teaching on marriage—an attack, by the way, which prompted us here at The Remnant to join the fight to DEFEND BISHOP MORLINO last year.\n\"If you'll permit me, what the Church needs now is more hatred! As I have said previously, St. Thomas Aquinas said that hatred of wickedness actually belongs to the virtue of charity. As the Book of Proverbs says 'My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness (Prov. 8:7).' It is an act of love to hate sin and to call others to turn away from sin. – Bishop Robert Morlino\nThis is what a courageous shepherd looks like! In our opinion, during the most vile clergy sex scandal in history, every bishop in the country must do exactly what Bishop Morlino has done, i.e., issue a statement of fidelity to the Church’s moral theology, specifically her teaching against the mortal sin of homosexual acts. In so doing, the bishops will incur the wrath of the enemies of the Church, yes. They will be crucified in the media, yes. But they will also be doing their sacred duty before God in reassuring their thoroughly scandalized flocks that they are absolutely committed to the defense and enforcement of the Church’s moral teaching at a time when it is under scurrilous attack from within. Nothing less will do. Bishop Morlino has now done it, and we respectfully demand that the rest of the American bishops either follow suit or face the charge of being complicit with the degenerate and even criminal shepherds, accounts of whose betrayal and vice now dominate the news. May God bless and keep Bishop Robert Morlino. MJM\nBishop Robert C. Morlino's letter to the faithful on the ongoing sexual abuse crisis in the Church\nAugust 18, 2018\nDear brothers and sisters in Christ of the Diocese of Madison,\nThe past weeks have brought a great deal of scandal, justified anger, and a call for answers and action by many faithful Catholics here in the U.S. and overseas, directed at the Church hierarchy regarding sexual sins by bishops, priests, and even cardinals. Still more anger is rightly directed at those who have been complicit in keeping some of these serious sins from coming to light.\nFor my part — and I know I am not alone — I am tired of this. I am tired of people being hurt, gravely hurt! I am tired of the obfuscation of truth. I am tired of sin. And, as one who has tried — despite my many imperfections — to lay down my life for Christ and His Church, I am tired of the regular violation of sacred duties by those entrusted with immense responsibility from the Lord for the care of His people.\nThe stories being brought into light and displayed in gruesome detail with regard to some priests, religious, and now even those in places of highest leadership, are sickening. Hearing even one of these stories is, quite literally, enough to make someone sick. But my own sickness at the stories is quickly put into perspective when I recall the fact that many individuals have lived through them for years. For them, these are not stories, they are indeed realities. To them I turn and say, again, I am sorry for what you have suffered and what you continue to suffer in your mind and in your heart.\nIf you have not already done so, I beg you to reach out, as hard as that may be, and seek help to begin to heal. Also, if you’ve been hurt by a priest of our diocese, I encourage you to come forward, to make a report to law enforcement and to our Victim’s Assistance Coordinator, so that we might begin, with you as an individual, to try and set things right to the greatest extent possible.\nThere is nothing about these stories that is okay. These actions, committed by more than a few, can only be classified as evil, evil that cries out for justice and sin that must be cast out from our Church.\nFaced with stories of the depravity of sinners within the Church, I have been tempted to despair. And why? The reality of sin — even sin in the Church — is nothing new. We are a Church made of sinners, but we are sinners called to sanctity. So what is new? What is new is the seeming acceptance of sin by some in the Church, and the apparent efforts to cover over sin by them and others. Unless and until we take seriously our call to sanctity, we, as an institution and as individuals, will continue to suffer the “wages of sin.”\nFor too long we have diminished the reality of sin — we have refused to call a sin a sin — and we have excused sin in the name of a mistaken notion of mercy. In our efforts to be open to the world we have become all too willing to abandon the Way, the Truth, and the Life. In order to avoid causing offense we offer to ourselves and to others niceties and human consolation.\nWhy do we do this? Is it out of an earnest desire to display a misguided sense of being “pastoral?” Have we covered over the truth out of fear? Are we afraid of being disliked by people in this world? Or are we afraid of being called hypocrites because we are not striving tirelessly for holiness in our own lives?\nPerhaps these are the reasons, but perhaps it is more or less complex than this. In the end, the excuses do not matter. We must be done with sin. It must be rooted out and again considered unacceptable. Love sinners? Yes. Accept true repentance? Yes. But do not say sin is okay. And do not pretend that grave violations of office and of trust come without grave, lasting consequences.\nFor the Church, the crisis we face is not limited to the McCarrick affair, or the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report, or anything else that may come. The deeper crisis that must be addressed is the license for sin to have a home in individuals at every level of the Church. There is a certain comfort level with sin that has come to pervade our teaching, our preaching, our decision making, and our very way of living.\nIf you’ll permit me, what the Church needs now is more hatred! As I have said previously, St. Thomas Aquinas said that hatred of wickedness actually belongs to the virtue of charity. As the Book of Proverbs says “My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness (Prov. 8:7).” It is an act of love to hate sin and to call others to turn away from sin.\nThere must be no room left, no refuge for sin — either within our own lives, or within the lives of our communities. To be a refuge for sinners (which we should be), the Church must be a place where sinners can turn to be reconciled. In this I speak of all sin. But to be clear, in the specific situations at hand, we are talking about deviant sexual — almost exclusively homosexual — acts by clerics. We’re also talking about homosexual propositions and abuses against seminarians and young priests by powerful priests, bishops, and cardinals. We are talking about acts and actions which are not only in violation of the sacred promises made by some, in short, sacrilege, but also are in violation of the natural moral law for all. To call it anything else would be deceitful and would only ignore the problem further.\nThere has been a great deal of effort to keep separate acts which fall under the category of now-culturally-acceptable acts of homosexuality from the publically-deplorable acts of pedophilia. That is to say, until recently the problems of the Church have been painted purely as problems of pedophilia — this despite clear evidence to the contrary. It is time to be honest that the problems are both and they are more. To fall into the trap of parsing problems according to what society might find acceptable or unacceptable is ignoring the fact that the Church has never held ANY of it to be acceptable — neither the abuse of children, nor any use of one’s sexuality outside of the marital relationship, nor the sin of sodomy, nor the entering of clerics into intimate sexual relationships at all, nor the abuse and coercion by those with authority.\nIn this last regard, special mention should be made of the most notorious and highest in ranking case, that being the allegations of former-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick’s (oft-rumored, now very public) sexual sins, predation, and abuse of power. The well-documented details of this case are disgraceful and seriously scandalous, as is any covering up of such appalling actions by other Church leaders who knew about it based on solid evidence.\nWhile recent credible accusations of child sexual abuse by Archbishop McCarrick have brought a whole slew of issues to light, long-ignored was the issue of abuse of his power for the sake of homosexual gratification.\nIt is time to admit that there is a homosexual subculture within the hierarchy of the Catholic Church that is wreaking great devastation in the vineyard of the Lord. The Church’s teaching is clear that the homosexual inclination is not in itself sinful, but it is intrinsically disordered in a way that renders any man stably afflicted by it unfit to be a priest. And the decision to act upon this disordered inclination is a sin so grave that it cries out to heaven for vengeance, especially when it involves preying upon the young or the vulnerable. Such wickedness should be hated with a perfect hatred. Christian charity itself demands that we should hate wickedness just as we love goodness. But while hating the sin, we must never hate the sinner, who is called to conversion, penance, and renewed communion with Christ and His Church, through His inexhaustible mercy.\nAt the same time, however, the love and mercy which we are called to have even for the worst of sinners does not exclude holding them accountable for their actions through a punishment proportionate to the gravity of their offense. In fact, a just punishment is an important work of love and mercy, because, while it serves primarily as retribution for the offense committed, it also offers the guilty party an opportunity to make expiation for his sin in this life (if he willingly accepts his punishment), thus sparing him worse punishment in the life to come. Motivated, therefore, by love and concern for souls, I stand with those calling for justice to be done upon the guilty.\nThe sins and crimes of McCarrick, and of far too many others in the Church, bring suspicion and mistrust upon many good and virtuous priests, bishops, and cardinals, and suspicion and mistrust upon many great and respectable seminaries and so many holy and faithful seminarians. The result of the first instance of mistrust harms the Church and the very good work we do in Christ’s name. It causes others to sin in their thoughts, words, and deeds — which is the very definition of scandal. And the second mistrust harms the future of the Church, since our future priests are at stake.\nI said that I was tempted to despair in light of all of this. However, that temptation quickly passed, thanks be to God. No matter how large the problem, we know that we are called to go forward in faith, to rely upon God’s promises to us, and to work hard to make every bit of difference we can, within our spheres of influence.\nI have recently had the opportunity to talk directly with our seminarians about these very pressing matters, and I have begun to, and will continue to, talk with the priests of the diocese, as well as the faithful, in person and through my weekly column and homilies, making things as clear as I can, from my perspective. Here now, I offer a few thoughts to those of my diocese:\nIn the first place, we must continue to build upon the good work which we have accomplished in protecting the youth and vulnerable of our diocese. This is a work on which we can never rest in our vigilance, nor our efforts to improve. We must continue in our work of education for all and hold to the effective policies that have been implemented, requiring psychological exams for all candidates for ministry, as well as across-the-board background checks for anyone working with children or vulnerable individuals.\nHere again, I state, as we have done consistently, if you have knowledge of any sort of criminal abuse of children by someone in the Church, contact law enforcement. If you need help in contacting law enforcement contact our Victim’s Assistance Coordinator and she will help connect you with the best resources. If you are an adult victim of sexual abuse from childhood, we still encourage you to reach out to law enforcement first, but even if you don’t want to, please still reach out to us.\nTo our seminarians: If you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me and to the seminary rector. I will address it swiftly and vigorously. I will not stand for this in my diocese or anywhere I send men for formation. I trust that the seminaries I choose, very discriminately, to help form our men will not ignore this type of scandalous behavior, and I will continue to verify that expectation.\nTo our priests: Most simply, live out the promises you made on your ordination day. You are called to serve Christ’s people, beginning with praying daily the Liturgy of the Hours. This is to keep you very close to God. In addition, you promised to obey and be loyal to your bishop. In obedience, strive to live out your priesthood as a holy priest, a hard working priest, and a pure and happy priest — as Christ Himself is calling you to do. And by extension, live a chaste and celibate life so that you can completely give your life to Christ, the Church, and the people whom he has called you to serve. God will give you the graces to do so. Ask Him for the help you need daily and throughout every day. And if you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me. I will not stand for this in my diocese any more than in our seminaries.\nTo the faithful of the diocese: If you are the victim of abuse of any kind by a priest, bishop, cardinal, or any employee of the Church, bring it forward. It will be addressed quickly and justly. If you have directly witnessed sexual advances or any type of abuse, bring it forward as well. Such actions are sinful and scandalous and we cannot allow anyone to use their position or power to abuse another person. Again, in addition to injuring individuals, these actions injure the very Body of Christ, His Church.\nFurthermore, I add my name to those calling for real and sustained reform in the episcopate, priesthood, our parishes, schools, universities, and seminaries that would root out and hold accountable any would-be sexual predator or accomplice;\nI will hold the priests of the diocese to their promise to live a chaste and celibate life of service to you and your parish, and evidence of failure in this regard will be justly addressed;\nI will likewise hold every man studying for the priesthood for our diocese accountable to living a chaste and celibate life as part of his formation for the priesthood. Failure to do so will lead to dismissal from diocesan sponsorship;\nI will continue to require (with our men and our funds) that all seminaries to which we send men to study be vigilant that seminarians are protected from sexual predators and provide an atmosphere conducive to their holistic formation as holy priests, in the image of Christ;\nI ask all the faithful of the diocese to assist in keeping us accountable to civil authorities, the faithful in the pews, and to God Almighty, not only to protect children and the youth from sexual predators in the Church, but our seminarians, university students, and all the faithful as well. I promise to put any victim and their sufferings before that of the personal and professional reputation of a priest, or any Church employee, guilty of abuse;\nI ask everyone reading this to pray. Pray earnestly for the Church and all her ministers. Pray for our seminarians. And pray for yourselves and your families. We must all work daily on our own personal holiness and hold ourselves accountable first and, in turn, hold our brothers and sisters accountable as well, and\nFinally, I ask you all to join me and the entire clergy of the Diocese of Madison in making public and private acts of reparation to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus and to the Immaculate Heart of Mary for all the sins of sexual depravity committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy. I will be offering a public Mass of reparation on Friday, September 14, the Feast of the Triumph of the Holy Cross, at Holy Name Heights and I ask all pastors to do the same in their own parishes. In addition, I ask that all priests, clergy, religious, and diocesan employees join me in observing the upcoming Autumn Ember Days (Sep. 19, 21, and 22) as days of fasting and abstinence in reparation for the sins and outrages committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy and I invite all the faithful to do the same. Some sins, like some demons, can only be driven out by prayer and fasting.\nThis letter and these statements and promises are not intended to be an exhaustive list of what we can and need to do in the Church to begin to heal from, and stave off, this deep illness in the Church, but rather the next steps I believe we can take locally.\nMore than anything else, we as a Church must cease our acceptance of sin and evil. We must cast out sin from our own lives and run toward holiness. We must refuse to be silent in the face of sin and evil in our families and communities and we must demand from our pastors — myself included — that they themselves are striving day in and day out for holiness. We must do this always with loving respect for individuals but with a clear understanding that true love can never exist without truth.\nAgain, right now there is a lot of justified anger and passion coming from many holy and faithful lay people and clerics across the country, calling for real reform and “house cleaning” of this type of depravity. I stand with them. I don’t know yet how this will play out nationally or internationally. But I do know this, and I make this my last point and last promise, for the Diocese of Madison: “As for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.”\nFaithfully yours in the Lord,\nMost Rev. Robert C. Morlino\nBishop of Madison\nThis text first appeared in the Madison Catholic Herald.", "text_tgt": "Il vescovo Morlino prende di mira la \"sottocultura omosessuale\" nella Chiesa, chiede riparazione al Sacro Cuore di Gesù\nNel corso degli anni, il vescovo Robert Morlino della diocesi di Madison ha confermato molti dei miei figli secondo il tradizionale rito della Confermazione, poiché la sua diocesi è stata un porto nella tempesta per molte famiglie cattoliche sfollate e disilluse. Naturalmente, non siamo d'accordo su tutto, ma la sua fede e la sua sollecitudine pastorale sono state per noi una luce nelle tenebre e la prova che Dio non ci ha lasciato orfani. E ora questo, finalmente, un vescovo con il coraggio di guardare la bestia negli occhi e pronunciare il suo nome ad alta voce. Il vescovo Morlino lo fa in un momento in cui è sotto pesante attacco come un \"hater\" per aver difeso gli insegnamenti della Chiesa sul matrimonio, un attacco, tra l'altro, che ci ha spinto qui a The Remnant a unir\n\"Se mi permettete, ciò di cui la Chiesa ha bisogno ora è più odio! Come ho detto in precedenza, San Tommaso d'Aquino ha detto che l'odio per la malvagità appartiene in realtà alla virtù della carità. Come dice il Libro dei Proverbi 'La mia bocca mediterà la verità, e le mie labbra odieranno la malvagità (Prov. 8:7) '. È un atto di amore odiare il peccato e chiamare gli altri a allontanarsi dal peccato.  Vescovo Robert Morlino\nQuesto è il volto di un pastore coraggioso! A nostro avviso, durante il più vile scandalo sessuale del clero nella storia, ogni vescovo del paese deve fare esattamente ciò che ha fatto il vescovo Morlino, cioè, rilasciare una dichiarazione di fedeltà alla teologia morale della Chiesa, in particolare al suo insegnamento contro il peccato mortale degli atti omosessuali. In tal modo, i vescovi si incolperanno dell'ira dei nemici della Chiesa, sì. Saranno crocifissi nei media, sì. Ma faranno anche il loro sacro dovere davanti a Dio nel rassicurare i loro greggi completamente scandalizzati che sono assolutamente impegnati a far rispettare e difendere l'insegnamento morale della Chiesa in un momento in cui è sotto attacco scandaloso dall'interno. Niente di meno farà. Il\nLettera del vescovo Robert C. Morlino ai fedeli sulla crisi degli abusi sessuali nella Chiesa\n18 agosto 2018\nCari fratelli e sorelle in Cristo della diocesi di Madison,\nLe scorse settimane hanno portato un grande scandalo, una giusta rabbia e un appello a rispondere e ad agire da parte di molti fedeli cattolici qui negli Stati Uniti e all'estero, rivolto alla gerarchia della Chiesa riguardo ai peccati sessuali commessi da vescovi, sacerdoti e persino cardinali.\nDa parte mia - e so di non essere solo - sono stanco di questo. Sono stanco di persone che soffrono, gravemente ferite! Sono stanco dell'offuscamento della verità. Sono stanco del peccato. E, come qualcuno che ha cercato - nonostante le mie molte imperfezioni - di dare la vita per Cristo e la sua Chiesa, sono stanco della regolare violazione dei doveri sacri da parte di coloro ai quali il Signore ha affidato un'immensa responsabilità per la cura del suo popolo.\nLe storie che vengono portate alla luce e mostrate in dettaglio e con orribili dettagli riguardo a alcuni sacerdoti, religiosi e ora anche quelli che occupano posizioni di massima leadership, sono disgustose. Sentire anche una sola di queste storie è, letteralmente, sufficiente a far ammalare qualcuno. Ma la mia stessa malattia per le storie viene rapidamente messa in prospettiva quando ricordo il fatto che molti individui le hanno vissute per anni. Per loro, queste non sono storie, sono davvero realtà. Mi rivolgo a loro e dico, ancora una volta, sono dispiaciuto per quello che avete sofferto e per quello che continuate a soffrire nella vostra mente e nel vostro cuore.\nSe non l'avete già fatto, vi prego di cercare aiuto, per quanto difficile possa essere, e di iniziare a guarire. inoltre, se siete stati feriti da un prete della nostra diocesi, vi incoraggio a presentarvi, a fare una denuncia alle forze dell'ordine e al nostro coordinatore per l'assistenza alle vittime, in modo che possiamo iniziare, con voi come individui, a cercare di rimediare al massimo possibile.\nQueste azioni, commesse da più di pochi, possono essere classificate solo come male, il male che grida giustizia e il peccato che deve essere cacciato dalla nostra Chiesa.\nDi fronte alle storie della depravazione dei peccatori all'interno della Chiesa, sono stato tentato di disperare. E perché? La realtà del peccato - anche il peccato nella Chiesa - non è nulla di nuovo. Siamo una Chiesa fatta di peccatori, ma siamo peccatori chiamati alla santità. Quindi, cosa c'è di nuovo? Ciò che c'è di nuovo è l'apparente accettazione del peccato da parte di alcuni nella Chiesa, e gli apparenti sforzi di coprire il peccato da parte loro e degli altri. A meno che e fino a quando non prendiamo sul serio la nostra chiamata alla santità, noi, come istituzione e come individui, continueremo a soffrire i \"salari\" del peccato.\nPer troppo tempo abbiamo diminuito la realtà del peccato  abbiamo rifiutato di chiamare peccato peccato  e abbiamo scusato il peccato in nome di una nozione errata di misericordia. Nei nostri sforzi per essere aperti al mondo siamo diventati troppo disposti ad abbandonare la Via, la Verità e la Vita. Per evitare di causare offesa offriamo a noi stessi e agli altri gentilezze e consolazioni umane.\nPerché lo facciamo? È per un sincero desiderio di manifestare un senso sbagliato di essere pastorali? Abbiamo nascosto la verità per paura? Temete di non essere graditi dalle persone di questo mondo? o temete di essere chiamati ipocriti perché non vi sforzate instancabilmente di essere santi nella vostra vita?\nForse queste sono le ragioni, ma forse è più o meno complessa di questo. Alla fine, le scuse non contano. Dobbiamo finire con il peccato. Deve essere sradicato e di nuovo considerato inaccettabile. Amare i peccatori? Sì. Accettare il vero pentimento? Sì. Ma non dire che il peccato va bene. E non fingere che gravi violazioni di ufficio e di fiducia non abbiano gravi e durature conseguenze.\nPer la Chiesa, la crisi che affrontiamo non è limitata all'affare McCarrick, o al rapporto del Gran Giuri' della Pennsylvania, o a qualsiasi altra cosa che possa venire. La crisi più profonda che deve essere affrontata è la licenza per il peccato di avere una casa negli individui a ogni livello della Chiesa. C'è un certo livello di comfort con il peccato che è arrivato a pervadere il nostro insegnamento, la nostra predicazione, il nostro processo decisionale e il nostro stesso modo di vivere.\nSe mi permetti, ciò di cui la Chiesa ha bisogno ora è più odio! Come ho detto in precedenza, San Tommaso d'Aquino ha detto che l'odio per la malvagità appartiene in realtà alla virtù della carità. Come dice il Libro dei Proverbi: \"La mia bocca mediterà la verità, e le mie labbra odieranno la malvagità\" (Prov. 8:7).\nNon deve esserci spazio, nessun rifugio per il peccato  né nella nostra vita, né nella vita delle nostre comunità. Per essere un rifugio per i peccatori (come dovremmo essere), la Chiesa deve essere un luogo dove i peccatori possono rivolgersi per riconciliarsi. In questo parlo di tutti i peccati. Ma per essere chiari, nelle situazioni specifiche in questione, stiamo parlando di atti sessuali devianti  quasi esclusivamente omosessuali  da parte di chierici. Stiamo anche parlando di proposte omosessuali e abusi contro seminaristi e giovani sacerdoti da parte di potenti sacerdoti, vescovi e cardinali. Stiamo parlando di atti e azioni che non solo violano le sacre promesse fatte da alcuni, in breve, sacrilegi, ma sono anche in violazione della legge morale naturale per tutti. Chiamarlo diversamente sarebbe inganne\nÈ stato fatto un grande sforzo per mantenere separati gli atti che rientrano nella categoria degli atti omosessuali ora culturalmente accettabili dagli atti pubblicamente deplorevoli della pedofilia. Cioè, fino a poco tempo fa i problemi della Chiesa sono stati dipinti puramente come problemi di pedofilia, nonostante le chiare prove del contrario. È tempo di essere onesti sul fatto che i problemi sono entrambi e sono più. Cadere nella trappola di analizzare i problemi in base a ciò che la società potrebbe trovare accettabile o inaccettabile è ignorare il fatto che la Chiesa non ha mai considerato accettabile NESSUNO di essi, né l'abuso sui bambini, né l'uso della propria sessualità al di fuori del rapporto coniugale, né il peccato della sodomia, né l'ingresso di chieri in relazioni sessuali in\nIn quest'ultimo caso, si dovrebbe fare una menzione speciale del caso più noto e più alto nella classifica, che è l'accusa di peccati sessuali, predazione e abuso di potere dell'ex cardinale Theodore McCarrick (spesso di cui si parla, ora molto pubblico). I dettagli ben documentati di questo caso sono vergognosi e seriamente scandalosi, così come qualsiasi copertura di tali azioni spaventose da parte di altri capi della Chiesa che ne erano a conoscenza sulla base di prove solide.\nMentre le recenti accuse credibili di abusi sessuali su minori da parte dell'arcivescovo McCarrick hanno portato alla luce una serie di questioni, a lungo ignorata è stata la questione dell'abuso del suo potere per il bene della gratificazione omosessuale.\nÈ tempo di ammettere che c'è una sottocultura omosessuale all'interno della gerarchia della Chiesa Cattolica che sta provocando grande devastazione nella vigna del Signore. L'insegnamento della Chiesa è chiaro che l'inclinazione omosessuale non è in sé peccaminosa, ma è intrinsecamente disordinata in un modo che rende ogni uomo che ne è costantemente afflitto inadatto a essere sacerdote. E la decisione di agire su questa inclinazione disordinata è un peccato così grave che grida al cielo per vendetta, specialmente quando comporta la preda dei giovani o dei vulnerabili. Tale malvagità deve essere odiata con un odio perfetto. La carità cristiana stessa esige che odiamo la malvagità come amiamo la bontà. Ma mentre odiamo il peccato, non dobbiamo mai odiare il peccatore,\nAllo stesso tempo, tuttavia, l'amore e la misericordia che siamo chiamati ad avere anche per i peggiori peccatori non escludono di renderli responsabili delle loro azioni con una punizione proporzionata alla gravità della loro offesa. In realtà, una punizione giusta è un'opera importante di amore e misericordia, perché, mentre serve principalmente come punizione per l'offesa commessa, offre anche alla parte colpevole l'opportunità di fare espiazione per il suo peccato in questa vita (se accetta volontariamente la sua punizione), risparmiandogli così una punizione peggiore nella vita futura.\nI peccati e i crimini di McCarrick, e di molti altri nella Chiesa, portano sospetto e sfiducia su molti buoni e virtuosi sacerdoti, vescovi e cardinali, e sospetto e sfiducia su molti grandi e rispettabili seminari e tanti santi e fedeli seminaristi. Il risultato del primo caso di sfiducia danneggia la Chiesa e il buon lavoro che facciamo in nome di Cristo.\nHo detto che ero tentato di disperare alla luce di tutto questo. Tuttavia, quella tentazione è passata rapidamente, grazie a Dio. Non importa quanto grande sia il problema, sappiamo che siamo chiamati ad andare avanti nella fede, a fare affidamento sulle promesse di Dio a noi, e a lavorare sodo per fare ogni piccola differenza che possiamo, all'interno delle nostre sfere di influenza.\nRecentemente ho avuto l'opportunità di parlare direttamente con i nostri seminaristi su questi temi molto urgenti, e ho iniziato, e continuerò a parlare con i sacerdoti della diocesi, così come i fedeli, di persona e attraverso la mia rubrica settimanale e le mie omelie, rendendo le cose più chiare possibile, dal mio punto di vista.\nIn primo luogo, dobbiamo continuare a costruire il buon lavoro che abbiamo compiuto per proteggere i giovani e i vulnerabili della nostra diocesi. Questo è un lavoro su cui non possiamo mai riposare nella nostra vigilanza, né nei nostri sforzi per migliorare. Dobbiamo continuare nel nostro lavoro di educazione per tutti e attenerci alle politiche efficaci che sono state attuate, richiedendo esami psicologici per tutti i candidati al ministero, così come controlli di background generali per chiunque lavori con bambini o individui vulnerabili.\nSe avete bisogno di aiuto per contattare le forze dell'ordine contattate il nostro coordinatore per l'assistenza alle vittime e lei vi aiuterà a mettervi in contatto con le migliori risorse. Se siete un adulto vittima di abusi sessuali sin dall'infanzia, vi incoraggiamo comunque a contattare prima le forze dell'ordine, ma anche se non lo volete, vi preghiamo di contattarci.\nAi nostri seminaristi: se siete stati indecorosamente proposti, abusati o minacciati (non importa da chi), o se siete stati testimoni di un comportamento indecoroso, riferitecelo a me e al rettore del seminario. Lo affronterò rapidamente e con forza. Non lo sopporterò nella mia diocesi o ovunque io mandi uomini per la formazione. Confido che i seminari che io scelgo, molto discriminatamente, per aiutare a formare i nostri uomini non ignoreranno questo tipo di comportamento scandaloso, e continuerò a verificare questa aspettativa.\nAi nostri sacerdoti: vivete semplicemente le promesse fatte il giorno della vostra ordinazione. Siete chiamati a servire il popolo di Cristo, cominciando con la preghiera quotidiana della Liturgia delle Ore. Questo è per tenervi molto vicini a Dio. Inoltre, avete promesso di obbedire e di essere fedeli al vostro vescovo. In obbedienza, sforzatevi di vivere il vostro sacerdozio come un sacerdote santo, un sacerdote che lavora sodo, e un sacerdote puro e felice  come Cristo stesso vi chiama a fare. E per estensione, vivete una vita casta e celibe in modo da poter dare completamente la vostra vita a Cristo, alla Chiesa, e al popolo che Egli vi ha chiamato a servire. Dio vi darà le grazie per farlo. ChiedeteGli l'aiuto di cui avete bisogno ogni giorno e per tutto il giorno. E se siete\nAi fedeli della diocesi: Se siete vittime di abusi di qualsiasi tipo da parte di un sacerdote, vescovo, cardinale o qualsiasi dipendente della Chiesa, portatelo avanti. Sarà affrontato rapidamente e giustamente. Se siete stati testimoni diretti di avance sessuali o di qualsiasi tipo di abuso, portatelo avanti. Tali azioni sono peccaminose e scandalose e non possiamo permettere a nessuno di usare la propria posizione o potere per abusare di un'altra persona. Ancora una volta, oltre a danneggiare gli individui, queste azioni danneggiano il Corpo stesso di Cristo, la Sua Chiesa.\nInoltre, aggiungo il mio nome a quelli che chiedono una vera e duratura riforma nell'episcopato, nel sacerdozio, nelle nostre parrocchie, scuole, università e seminari che sradicino e rendano responsabili qualsiasi potenziale predatore sessuale o complice;\nRiterro' i sacerdoti della diocesi fedeli alla loro promessa di vivere una vita casta e celibe al servizio di lei e della sua parrocchia, e le prove di fallimento a questo riguardo saranno giustamente affrontate;\nAllo stesso modo, chiunque studi per il sacerdozio nella nostra diocesi dovrà vivere una vita casta e celibe come parte della sua formazione per il sacerdozio.\nContinuerò a chiedere (con i nostri uomini e i nostri fondi) che tutti i seminari in cui inviamo uomini a studiare siano vigili affinché i seminaristi siano protetti dai predatori sessuali e forniscano un'atmosfera favorevole alla loro formazione olistica come santi sacerdoti, a immagine di Cristo;\nChiedo a tutti i fedeli della diocesi di aiutarci a renderci responsabili alle autorità civili, ai fedeli nelle panche e a Dio Onnipotente, non solo per proteggere i bambini e i giovani dai predatori sessuali nella Chiesa, ma anche i nostri seminaristi, studenti universitari e tutti i fedeli.\nChiedo a chiunque legga questo di pregare. Pregate con fervore per la Chiesa e tutti i suoi ministri. Pregate per i nostri seminaristi. E pregate per voi stessi e le vostre famiglie. Dobbiamo tutti lavorare ogni giorno sulla nostra santità personale e renderci conto prima di tutto e, a nostra volta, far rendere conto anche ai nostri fratelli e sorelle, e\nInfine, chiedo a tutti di unirsi a me e all'intero clero della Diocesi di Madison nel compiere atti pubblici e privati di riparazione al Sacro Cuore di Gesù e al Cuore Immacolato di Maria per tutti i peccati di depravazione sessuale commessi dai membri del clero e dell'episcopato. Offrirò una messa pubblica di riparazione venerdì 14 settembre, festa del Trionfo della Santa Croce, a Holy Name Heights e chiedo a tutti i pastori di fare lo stesso nelle loro parrocchie. Inoltre, chiedo a tutti i sacerdoti, il clero, le religiose e gli impiegati diocesani di unirsi a me nell'osservare i prossimi Giorni dell'Autunno dell'Embra (il 19, 21 e 22 settembre) come giorni di digiuno e astinenza in ri\nQuesta lettera e queste dichiarazioni e promesse non sono intese come un elenco esaustivo di ciò che possiamo e dobbiamo fare nella Chiesa per iniziare a guarire da, e prevenire, questa profonda malattia nella Chiesa, ma piuttosto i prossimi passi che credo possiamo fare a livello locale.\nPiù di ogni altra cosa, noi come Chiesa dobbiamo cessare di accettare il peccato e il male. Dobbiamo scacciare il peccato dalla nostra vita e correre verso la santità. Dobbiamo rifiutare di rimanere in silenzio di fronte al peccato e al male nelle nostre famiglie e comunità e dobbiamo chiedere ai nostri pastori - me stesso incluso - che essi stessi si sforzino giorno dopo giorno di essere santi. Dobbiamo farlo sempre con amorevole rispetto per gli individui, ma con una chiara comprensione che il vero amore non può mai esistere senza la verità.\nAncora una volta, in questo momento c'è molta rabbia e passione giustificata proveniente da molti laici e chierici santi e fedeli in tutto il paese, che chiedono una vera riforma e \"pulizia della casa\" da questo tipo di depravazione. Io sono con loro. Non so ancora come si svolgerà a livello nazionale o internazionale. Ma lo so, e faccio questo il mio ultimo punto e ultima promessa, per la diocesi di Madison: \"Per quanto riguarda me e la mia famiglia, serviremo il Signore\".\nFedeli ai vostri nel Signore,\nIl reverendo Robert C.

Just last week I reported on his previous comments about being incarcerated earlier and that it might be a plot to get rid of him in prison.\nThis isn't far-fetched.

The stepmother, Samina Gilani, also previously said Imran stole two laptops from her. Imran, Abid and Jamal Awan — along with Imran’s wife, Hina Alvi, and a friend — worked as IT administrators for 1 out of every 5 House Democrats and could read all their emails and files until police banned them from the network in February 2017for “numerous violations of House security policies.” Months later, none of the family is in jail, and the stepmother and other witnesses have said Imran and Abid have used their freedom to try to steer the outcome of the case since, including by threatening them not to cooperate with authorities, TheDCNF previously reported. In April 2016, the House’s Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) detected allegedly falsified purchase orders, and the Inspector General quickly expanded the scope to investigate cyber violations, finding that members of the Awan family improperly accessed congressmen’s servers and the House Democratic Caucus server thousands of times. Though House officials suspected that equipment was being stolen, the Capitol Police did not search their homes, The Daily Caller News Foundation learned, and did not ban them from the network until nearly a year later. In the meantime, evidence appears to have been compromised: In December 2016, the CAO notified congressmen that the caucus server had physically disappeared. Though Abid played a prominent role in the late-2016 IG report, he has not been arrested, with congressmen saying a criminal investigation is ongoing. In January 2017, in the days around his father’s death, Abid removed Gilani as the beneficiary of his father’s life insurance and replaced her with himself, which led to a lawsuit, TheDCNF previously reported. Abid’s attorney, Jim Bacon, used the life insurance lawsuit to force Gilani to sit for a sworn deposition Oct. 4, 2017 in which he told her to reveal what she told the FBI about the congressional criminal probe and tried to get her to find out details from investigators. In one exchange, Bacon knew that she had emailed with the FBI. BACON Q: [redacted] is your email address, isn’t it? And you send emails from that address including two emails to the FBI, didn’t you?\nGILANI A: Yes, a long time ago.\nQ: No, not a long time ago. March 5th, 2017. March 6th, 2017. Ma’am, you lied to me, didn’t you? You lied to me, didn’t you? You’re a liar, aren’t you?\nA: I forgot about that. It was not in my mind.\nBACON: Ah. I think we need to take a break before I explode. Bacon did not respond to questions from the TheDCNF about how he knew Gilani had emailed the FBI on those dates….\nArticle posted with permission from Pamela Geller\nPamela Geller's commitment to freedom from jihad and Shariah shines forth in her books", "text_tgt": "Testimone: l'assistente informatica musulmana Awan l'ha intercettata, poi il conto bancario che controllava è stato svuotato\nI lettori di Geller Report da tempo hanno sentito parlare di questa violazione della sicurezza informatica da parte di personale IT musulmano per oltre un anno.
