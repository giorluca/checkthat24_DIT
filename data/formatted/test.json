"lang": "en", "text": "French health minister resigns over controversial immigration law\n\nFrance’s health minister resigned as the government of President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday sought to quell a party revolt over the passing of tough new immigration legislation backed by the far-right.\nFollowing 18 months of wrangling over one of the flagship reforms of Macron’s second-term, both chambers of parliament backed the controversial legislation on Tuesday, with Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) endorsing the bill in a move some media dubbed a “kiss of death”.\nAround a quarter of the 251 lawmakers in Macron’s camp voted against the bill or abstained and several left-wing ministers have registered their opposition to the bill.\nHealth Minister Aurelien Rousseau resigned, although there were no immediate signs of other ministers following suit despite fears overnight.\nRousseau did not attend a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning and would be replaced on a temporary basis by junior minister Agnes Firmin Le Bodo, government spokesman Olivier Veran said.\n“There is no ministerial revolt,” he added.\nMacron was expected to address the reform in a television interview on Wednesday evening, while Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne sought to put on a brave face, saying the adoption of the law had not provoked a “crisis in the majority”.\nSpeaking on France Inter, Borne admitted that some of the provisions were probably unconstitutional, adding that the text “would have to evolve” once it had been examined by the Constitutional Council after referral by Macron.\n“We wanted to pass a law on useful, effective measures that our fellow citizens expect, with two objectives: To remove more quickly and more effectively those who have no right to be in France, and to better integrate those we choose to welcome,” she said.\nAt Wednesday’s Cabinet meeting, Macron declared that there are in the text “things that I don’t like but which are not against our values”, a participant, who asked not to be named, told AFP.\n\n‘Deep scars’\nThe text of the bill had to be hardened under pressure from the right, but Borne stressed that in the end the ruling party did not need the support of Le Pen’s far-right RN to push the bill through.\nBeating Le Pen to secure five more years in 2022, Macron has vowed to stave off her rise, but he has been accused of pandering to the far-right to push through his reform agenda.\n“The immigration law will leave deep scars,” said French right-wing daily Le Figaro, adding that Macron “had lost on all fronts”.\nLiberation, the left-wing newspaper, for its part spoke of a “moral defeat” for his party.\nFrance has a long tradition of welcoming refugees and immigrants, but a rise in the number of asylum seekers, a chronic affordable-housing shortage, and a cost-of-living crisis have worsened social tensions in the country.\nDozens of NGOs have slammed what they described as potentially the “most regressive” immigration law in decades.\nA key element of the law is that social security benefits for foreigners will now be conditioned on five years of presence in France, or 30 months for those who have jobs.\nMigration quotas can also now be agreed and there are measures for dual-national convicts being stripped of French nationality.\n\n‘Disgusting victory’\n“It’s a total victory for the ideas defended by Marine Le Pen,” said far-right lawmaker Jean-Philippe Tanguy.\nThe head of the conservative Republicans (LR) Party, Eric Ciotti, hailed the adoption of the law as a “historic victory for the right”.\nThe left-wing opposition slammed the measures.\nThe head of the Socialist deputies in the Assembly, Boris Vallaud, accused the government of “giving in to the most rancid ideas”.\nRadical left-wing leader Jean-Luc Melenchon denounced a “disgusting victory”.\nA hot-button issue in France, as elsewhere in Europe, immigration regularly inflames the political class.\nOn Wednesday, EU countries and lawmakers reached an agreement on an overhaul of the bloc’s laws on handling asylum-seekers and migrants, officials said.\nThe issue has taken on a harder political edge in Europe in recent years with the rise of nationalist anti-immigrant parties in several EU countries, including Italy, Sweden and The Netherlands."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling",

“Leadership” Of The “Pro-Life” Movement:\nFor most of the time from around 2004 to 2011, I was one of you. I opposed abortion, except in cases of rape and incest. But recent events have convinced me that all your talk about protecting the sanctity of human life is nothing more than hot air. I now believe that your hand-wringing and pearl-clutching about the sanctity of life is nothing more than a backdoor attempt to erode the right to privacy. That is something with which I cannot, and will not, identify.\nYou started in 2009 when your buddies in the Oklahoma state legislature tried to set up a database containing information about every abortion performed in the state. It would have contained the mother’s age, race, marital status, and a smorgasbord of other personal information–enough that the mother could have been legally identified even though her name wasn’t included.\nAs a journalism major, I know that if you put out enough information about a person to identify them, it is no different from posting the person’s name and address. For that reason, I thought almost immediately, “There’s no way in hell this is legal–or right.” It would put women at risk for harassment or worse, especially in small counties.\nThat law was later struck down in court. But it led me to wonder–did the people who wrote this horribly misbegotten bill intend for Oklahoma women to be harassed and trolled if they got an abortion?\nThose questions grew even louder later when Cheryl Sullenger was allowed to keep her job at Operation Rescue after it emerged that she’d helped Scott Roeder keep track of George Tiller’s court dates. She knew Tiller was a marked man for anti-abortion extremists in Wichita, and yet she essentially gives his court dates to a guy off the street? At the very least, she is morally responsible for Tiller’s murder. Criminal or not, basic decency would have demanded that Sullenger be fired out of respect for Tiller’s family. To add insult to injury, Operation Rescue hired this woman even after she took part in a plan to firebomb an abortion clinic.\nI had similar questions when the Republican-controlled House tried to change the definition of rape so that only instances of “forcible rape” could qualify for taxpayer funds. The GOP knows damn well that ALL rape is forcible, since rape is non-consensual by definition. Why did you and your buddies in the House GOP caucus even think this was a good idea?\nBut one of the final straws for me came when Florida tried to require all women getting an abortion in the state to have a vaginal ultrasound. They tried this in 2010 as well. During the first attempt, several women on Daily Kos came forward to say how horribly invasive this procedure is.\nThe only plausible explanation for so many instances of invasive legislation is that at its core, your movement doesn’t have a damn thing to do with protecting life. It was intended to tug at people’s heartstrings in order to get the government in our bedrooms through the back door. On paper, as a charismatic Christian, I should be receptive to pro-life arguments. But I could not see any possible good-faith explanation for this legislative overkill–unless there was an ulterior motive. Realizing that I’d been snowed, I formally resigned from the pro-life movement in March 2011.\nI wasn’t quite ready to identify as pro-choice as of yet. But more instances of your movement’s complete and utter lack of respect for basic human dignity knocked the scales from my eyes. You sponsor crisis pregnancy centers that scare women by giving them inaccurate information–dangerously so, in many cases. You tried to push a Wisconsin law that would have given in-laws the power to stop abortions. And you continue to embrace Operation Rescue despite the fact it glossed over Sullenger’s irresponsible and potentially criminal actions, as well as her murderous past.\nBut the absolute last straw came with the ordeal of Marlise Munoz in 2014. Even though she was brain dead, she was kept on life support for almost two months because she was pregnant–a scene that can only be described as Kafkaesque. Never mind that in all states, brain death is legal death–and it is not possible to maintain life support on a dead person. Never mind that Marlise had been without oxygen for so long that it couldn’t have survived in any event.\nAnd yet, when a judge ended this farce, Operation Rescue claimed that Marlise was in a coma, and condemned what they called the murder of an incapacitated woman and her child. Watch here. [video of interview with Operation Rescue]\nTo add insult to injury, all four Republican candidates for lieutenant governor of Texas said they would have kept Marlise on life support, and two (possibly three) of them said they would amend Texas law to require brain-dead women to stay on life support if they are pregnant. According to lawyers for the Munoz family, by this logic, hospitals would be required to check dead women for signs of pregnancy and hook them up to life support if there was a fetus there. So protecting the sanctity of human life requires desecrating corpses?????!!!!\nI now realized how positively Orwellian the “pro-life” movement was. If it is even remotely possible to force corpses to stay on life support, then your movement is, at its core, about destroying the right to privacy. I also realized that a number of my Kossack friends were on to something when they suggested that it was more accurate to describe you as “forced-birthers.”\nIf you cared about the sanctity of life, why in the hell would you even consider something as ghoulish as keeping life support on dead people??????!!!! If that’s what the sanctity of life means, I’ll pass. As far as I’m concerned, you left me. I didn’t leave you.\nLately, I’ve wondered if I was ever a part of your movement in the first place. After all, you have declared that allowing women to get an abortion in case of rape and incest is merely a “political judgment” that is necessary to get abortion restrictions on the books. Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! It’s basic human decency. Forcing a woman to keep the product of such a violation harkens back to the days when rape and incest was considered the victim’s fault.\nAnd now you people see nothing wrong with forcing little girls to keep their pregnancies at ages when they could be at risk for serious complications, and even death, if they go that route. Just last week, you had the gall to suggest a 12-year-old rape victim could be a murderer if she ended her pregnancy. You defend the sanctity of life when you’re not only willing to degrade a rape victim, but potentially put her at risk for taunting and bullying. Don’t you DARE say you care about her well-being when you use that kind of language. And don’t you DARE say that you care about the sanctity of life. Not when you’re willing to victimize women all over again after they have been horribly violated. You are not pro-life. You are for forced birth.\nIn the past, I’ve had people ask, “How can you be a Christian and vote for baby-killers?” Well, I, and a number of other Christians have the weird idea that abortion isn’t the be-all and end-all to everything. Moreover, I’ve seen what your movement is about at its core–and it’s fundamentally un-American. You are trying to use abortion to destroy one of the most sacrosanct rights we have that is not enumerated in the Constitution–the right to be left alone. I cannot identify with that, and I will not identify with that. Not now. Not ever.\nI’m not the only person who should be, on paper, receptive to your cause who feels this way. But I may be one of the first to lay it down in such stark terms. Either get off your sanctimonious high horses, or get out of the way.\nSincerely,\nDarrell"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Doubt", "start": 67, "end": 135}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 137, "end": 419}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 436, "end": 467}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 505, "end": 542}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 673, "end": 863}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 882, "end": 912}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 1155, "end": 1273}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1585, "end": 1717}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1720, "end": 1992}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1739, "end": 1751}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1818, "end": 1856}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 2386, "end": 2500}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2502, "end": 2635}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 2669, "end": 2749}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 3059, "end": 3178}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3211, "end": 3238}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 3335, "end": 3479}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3403, "end": 3423}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3482, "end": 3697}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3739, "end": 3979}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 4452, "end": 4482}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 4941, "end": 4979}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 5954, "end": 6193}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 6595, "end": 6854}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6789, "end": 6804}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6841, "end": 6852}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 6856, "end": 6968}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 7056, "end": 7070}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 7318, "end": 7580}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 7583, "end": 7665}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 7864, "end": 7913}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 7916, "end": 7950}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 8276, "end": 8284}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 8405, "end": 8445}], "article_id": "42103", "lang": "en", "text": "To stay or go? Bombarded by Israel, Gazans make anguished choice.\n\nShould I stay or should I go? Can I find a way out? Is anywhere safe?\nAs the Israeli military continued its bombardment of the Gaza Strip Friday and gave 1.1 million Gazans a 24-hour ultimatum to evacuate to the southern end of the besieged coastal enclave, these frantic questions consumed Gazans, with no clear answers – and life-or-death consequences.\nIn Gaza City, a sleepless night of bombardment and rumors gave way to a morning of frantic second-guessing and scrambling for transport as Israel called on Palestinians to vacate to south of Wadi Gaza, a dividing waterline in the center of the strip.\nHamas told Gazans to stay put, and the United Nations requested that Israel rescind the decision, which would create the largest single forced displacement the Middle East has seen in decades, calling it both “impossible” and “devastating.”\nBut those who could Friday packed into cars with little more than the clothes on their backs and drove out of Gaza City.\nA steady stream of vehicles along the coastal road leading south from Gaza City midday became an afternoon traffic jam.\n“People are packed in the streets, even evacuating on donkey carts,” says Sara al-Saqqa, a surgeon at Al Shifa Hospital. The facility had been one of the lone refuges in the city, and had hosted thousands seeking shelter from airstrikes amid the weeklong bombardment campaign that followed Hamas’ attack on Israel last Saturday.\n“Everyone is fleeing. I saw people evacuating; I could not even enter the hospital,” Dr. Saqqa says.\nYet still tens of thousands remained in Gaza City, without cars, fuel, or a destination or acquaintance to stay with in southern Gaza.\nIn response to the Hamas assault, which killed 1,300 Israelis, mostly civilians, Israel mounted a massive and relentless bombing campaign that had killed 1,799 Gazans as of Friday, leaving no neighborhood untouched and sparking a humanitarian crisis of enormous proportions.\nAs of late Thursday, before the Israeli ultimatum, 423,378 people had already been displaced by the six days of conflict in the 140-square-mile strip, the U.N.’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Friday.\nOn Friday, Gaza City residents received airdropped flyers in Arabic purporting to be from the Israeli army with a map of Gaza and an arrow pointing south, warning, “Gaza City has become a battlefield. You are to evacuate your home immediately and head to the south of Wadi Gaza.”\n“Terrorist organizations have launched a war against the state of Israel,” the flyer said, a copy of which was provided to the Monitor. “For your safety and security, do not return to your homes until further notice from the Israel Defence Forces.”\nHamas, the militant group that controls the strip, urged otherwise.\n“We tell the people of northern Gaza and from Gaza City, stay put in your homes, and your places,” Eyad al-Bozom, spokesperson for the Hamas Interior Ministry, was quoted by Reuters as saying in a press conference at Al Shifa early Friday.\n“By carrying out massacres against the civilians, the occupation wants to displace us once again from our land,” he said, dismissing the warnings as a “disgusting psychological war.”\nThe shortages of electricity and fuel, as well as disruptions to the communications network, began to affect Palestinians across the territory, with most Gazans plunged into darkness Thursday evening, without electricity for mobile phones. Israel said the cutoffs were intended to isolate an enemy that was still firing rockets into Israel, yet they were also preventing Gazans from receiving information or reaching what was supposed to be safer territory.\n\nHind Khoudary escapes with her family\nAfter my third sleepless night on a hospital floor at Al Shifa, I had to make the decision: Do I stay in Gaza City or go south? Do I go with my mother to Rafah, or to Deir al-Balah with my husband, to what was supposed to be relative safety?\nAt 10:41 a.m., my husband and I, my in-laws, my brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and their daughter, Loli, piled into the car to stay with family friends in the village of Deir al-Balah, 7 miles south of Wadi Gaza.\nWith only minutes to spare before our planned departure, I grabbed my laptop, phone chargers, my ID, and a bag my mother packed for me.\nI stopped by a pharmacy for treatment for an infection from a deep cut in my leg; all they could give me was some gauze.\n“We barely have medical supplies; four rolls of gauze is enough,” the pharmacist tells me.\nIn Gaza City, many gas stations were shuttered. I saw several people begging station managers for fuel.\nMy husband found one of the last gas stations still open, but the attendant could only provide us with 50 shekels’ ($12.57) worth of fuel – about 8 liters (2.1 gallons) – as part of a rationing cap to distribute fuel to as many people as possible.\nYet many people we know do not even have cars; cars have burned in the missile strikes. Others simply do not know anyone in southern Gaza to stay with. Others still prefer to stay rather than be internally displaced.\nMy aunt told me she would prefer dying at home, surrounded by her children and grandchildren, than evacuating. This is why thousands are staying put in Gaza City, despite the danger.\nAneel, one of many frantically trying to find a way out, was stranded in Tal al-Hawa, a neighborhood in southern Gaza City. She had been evacuated from her home in Shuja’iyya, east of the city center, after a missile strike earlier this week.\n“We can’t find a car to take us to the south; there are no cars and there is no one to take us,” she told my mother in an urgent phone call.\nThe coastal road leading out from Gaza City to the south, the road farthest from the barrier wall, was covered in dust and cracked from missile strikes. Because we left early, we made it to Deir al-Balah in 10 minutes. But now there are lines of cars to get out of Gaza City.\nAlthough Israel told us Deir al-Balah would be safe, within hours of our arrival a house was struck near us. Hours after we made the journey, three cars carrying families heading south reportedly were struck by Israeli missiles in Wadi Gaza.\nI wished I had had the time to grab my favorite blanket from home, and say one last goodbye to my family house, in case it is bombed before I can return.\n\nHealth care battle\nThe U.N. and international humanitarian organizations warned it was impossible to evacuate vulnerable and elderly Gazans and hospital patients from northern Gaza, many of whom rely on life support and mechanical ventilators.\n“There are severely ill people whose injuries mean their only chances of survival is being on life support,” said World Health Organization spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic. “Moving these people is a death sentence. Asking health workers to do so is beyond cruel.”\nThe order to evacuate has proved yet another crisis for local health care workers in Gaza facing an uphill battle.\nPalestine Red Crescent Society spokesperson Nebal Farsakh described the situation as “catastrophic,” with hospitals overflowing with patients, medical supplies dwindling, electricity shortages widespread, and health centers flooded with citizens seeking shelter. Paramedics brave airstrikes, and several have been killed in the weeklong conflict.\nOver the past week, hospitals have emerged as makeshift shelters as thousands of Palestinian civilians flocked to hospitals in northern Gaza such as Al Shifa and Al Quds, out of the belief that the health centers are now the only safe areas Israel will not strike.\nWith Israel’s ultimatum Friday, it is unclear whether those safe havens will remain.\nYet despite the challenges and the Israeli ultimatum, the Palestine Red Crescent Society says their health care workers will not “turn their backs” on Gaza City and abdicate their responsibility.\n“The decision has been made: We are not evacuating. We are not turning back on our duty. We will stay in our main office in Gaza,” Ms. Farsakh says.\n“We cannot evacuate the patients; most of them are not in condition for transfer right now. Al Quds hospital is crowded with displaced civilians, our team, and relocated paramedics,” she adds.\nMedhat Abbas, director general of Gaza’s Health Ministry, declared a “collapse” of Gaza’s health system, with overflowing hospitals struggling to treat injured civilians and unable to evacuate them.\n“The health sector completely collapsed,” Dr. Abbas says in a phone call from Gaza City cut short by communications disruptions. “People are sleeping on the ground in hospitals, which are overflowing with displaced civilians next to bodies and the injured.”\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 0, "end": 48}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 52, "end": 101}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 57, "end": 77}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 240, "end": 320}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 244, "end": 260}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 346, "end": 363}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 415, "end": 617}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 620, "end": 723}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 783, "end": 928}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1265, "end": 1288}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1496, "end": 1574}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1678, "end": 1686}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2008, "end": 2030}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2056, "end": 2083}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2241, "end": 2328}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2424, "end": 2446}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 2615, "end": 2650}, {"tag": "Red_Herring", "start": 2908, "end": 3295}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2994, "end": 3016}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2994, "end": 3016}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3449, "end": 3455}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3512, "end": 3545}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3614, "end": 3642}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4241, "end": 4249}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4307, "end": 4313}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 4546, "end": 4595}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4633, "end": 4639}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4726, "end": 4737}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4973, "end": 5185}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5191, "end": 5223}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5262, "end": 5279}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 5549, "end": 5583}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5605, "end": 5620}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5623, "end": 5679}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 5774, "end": 5840}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 6019, "end": 6042}], "article_id": "42104", "lang": "en", "text": "Despite the truce, people in Gaza will keep dying – this horrifying death toll must never be forgotten\n\nEven if the truce between Benjamin Netanyahu’s government and Hamas results in the promised four-day pause in hostilities – or longer – the horror enveloping Gaza in terms of lives lost is worse than many people think. Among those who oppose Israel’s onslaught, there are still those who do not truly grasp it. It’s understandable that Israeli authorities are seeking to sow doubt about the size of the death toll, because the numbers expose the gravity of the crimes being committed. But we should not be deceived.\nTake the argument that the health ministry is Hamas-run and, therefore, its figures can never be trusted. It sounds like a reasonable enough claim on the surface, until you realise that in previous conflicts the death toll reported by the ministry was largely consistent with the UN’s and even Israel’s counts. Last month, after doubts were raised by President Biden, the ministry even released the names, ages and identification numbers of the victims.\nIndeed, the health ministry’s official estimate – currently 13,300 dead after six weeks – could well be an underestimate, as a senior US official has conceded. The figures do not include the dead buried under rubble who have not been retrieved. According to the independent Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, which is chaired by US emeritus law professor and former UN special rapporteur on Palestine, Richard Falk, the civilian death toll as of 20 November is 16,413, with nearly 34,000 injured. This would mean one in every 142 Palestinian civilians killed in a month and a half.\nGiven that this slaughter may not end soon, the current health ministry tally of 13,300 dead, when placed in the context of Gaza’s population of 2.2 million, tells us something about the sheer scale of what has happened. Comparisons with other conflicts are truly eye-opening here. The Bosnian war loomed over my own childhood as a case study of an unspeakable atrocity. About 40,000 civilians died in those killing fields in the years between 1992 and 1995. That was over three years, not six weeks, and it was in a country whose prewar population was about twice that of Gaza.\nBut aren’t many of the deaths in Gaza not civilians, but Hamas militants, you might ask? The evidence suggests not. Research by the Iraq Body Count project, which diligently compiled violent civilian deaths after the 2003 invasion, concluded last month about Gaza that “few of the victims can have been combatants”. Analysing the ministry of health data, they found only a “modest excess of adult males killed”, which could be explained by their greater exposure to risk in, for instance, rescue efforts. With an estimated 70% of the dead being women and children – and many of the slain men unlikely to have been combatants – their conclusion is difficult to rebut.\nWe could also make a comparison with the war in Syria, rightly regarded as one of the great moral obscenities of our age. The UN estimates that nearly 307,000 civilians have met violent ends since 2011. Its prewar population was just over 10 times that of Gaza. This means that after just six weeks, the death rate of Palestinians is approaching half that of Syrians after a decade of war.\nAfter just six weeks, the death rate of Palestinians is approaching half that of Syrians after a decade of war.\nAnother comparison is Yemen. This is a tragedy close to my heart: I’ve written multiple columns about the western-backed Saudi onslaught and visited a Yemeni refugee camp, where children drew pictures of dead relatives slain by bombs. An estimated 15,000 Yemeni civilians were killed by direct military action between 2015 and 2021, mostly by Saudi-led airstrikes. This is comparable to Gaza, except Yemen’s average population in these war years was 14 times greater than Gaza’s, and this death toll was amassed over six years, not six weeks.\nIt might be countered that Yemen’s death toll is actually closer to 377,000, because of deaths from indirect causes, such as a lack of access to food, water and healthcare. But, of course, the same will be true of Gaza under siege and that figure will only become clear after the current bloodshed is over.\nA comparison of child deaths across conflicts, macabre as it is, underlines the unique nature of this conflict in Gaza. In the first two years of the Syrian war, children were estimated to represent roughly 10% of deaths, in Iraq since 2003, 8.6% and in Ukraine since the invasion, 6%. In Gaza, they represent an estimated 42% of deaths.\nNo comparison is perfect and every tragedy must be understood on its own terms. Yet these numbers give a sense of the unusually brutal scale of what is happening in Gaza. It is not as if the realities on the ground are hidden. Thanks to courageous journalists and media workers – dozens now killed – we have evidence of the civilian toll in the most graphic detail possible. So where is the urgency on behalf of western politicians and many media outlets to put a stop to this? Why doesn’t it rival their justified disgust at the horrors unleashed by Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine? Few cheerleaders of Israel’s invasion have been able to admit that Hamas’s obscene atrocities of 7 October do not justify civilian death on this scale.\nThis truce is welcome but the widespread destruction of infrastructure will mean people keep dying long after the bombs stop falling. And with Israel’s stated desire to occupy Gaza “for an indefinite period” , much violence is surely yet to come. We are left with a bleak conclusion. There isn’t even a pretence that Palestinian life matters. An Israeli civilian death toll of more than 1,000 was rightly understood to be intolerable, but there appears no limit to how many Gazans can meet violent ends. This brazen disregard for innocent life has barely been discussed in the west. It has been widely understood beyond in the Arab world and much of the global south, though, and it will not be forgotten."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 0, "end": 74}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 14, "end": 35}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 77, "end": 170}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 110, "end": 131}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 332, "end": 410}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 393, "end": 410}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 413, "end": 547}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 525, "end": 545}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 614, "end": 617}], "article_id": "42105", "lang": "en", "text": "Putin accuses 'neo-Nazis in Ukraine' of committing crimes against civilians\n\nVladimir Putin on Friday accused \"neo-Nazis in Ukraine\" of committing crimes against civilians, on the occasion of the international day of victims of the Holocaust, a rhetoric that the Russian president regularly uses to justify his military offensive.\n“Forgetting the lessons of history leads to the repetition of terrible tragedies.

Ron DeSantis’ signing of a six-week ban on the procedure a “terrible mistake.”\nSpeaking Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Trump repeatedly declined to say whether he would support a federal ban on abortion. He said he could “live with” the procedure being banned by individual states or nationwide through federal action, though he said “from a legal standpoint, I think it’s probably better” to be handled at the state level.\nRegarding the bill signed by DeSantis, which bans abortions before many women know they are pregnant, Trump said, “I think what he did is a terrible thing and a terrible mistake.”\nSo far, the former president has dominated the 2024 field while at times spurning the anti-abortion groups that traditionally have huge influence in Republican primaries. But Trump’s direct attack on DeSantis, whom he’s long treated as his chief rival, could give the Florida governor new fodder as he tries to regain momentum in his campaign and solidify his second-place standing.\nPosting on X, formerly known as Twitter, DeSantis campaign spokesman Bryan Griffin wrote of Trump: “If you want to appease Democrats, here’s your guy. If you want to defeat the Democrats in 2024, (DeSantis) is the only choice.”\nThe country’s largest anti-abortion organization, which backs a national ban on abortions at 15 weeks of pregnancy, quickly released a statement saying anything less restrictive “makes no sense.”\n“We’re at a moment where we need a human rights advocate, someone who is dedicated to saving the lives of children and serving mothers in need. Every single candidate should be clear on how they plan to do that,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.\nEvangelicals and other social conservatives who strongly oppose abortion make up the majority of those who participate and decide the winner in Iowa, where the Jan. 15 caucuses are first on the Republican nominating calendar. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds this summer signed an abortion ban similar to Florida’s. Reynolds has not endorsed a candidate.\nTrump has called himself the “the most pro-life president in American history” and noted that three of his picks for the Supreme Court formed the conservative majority that overturned Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed a federal right to abortion.\nInterviews with GOP voters and activists over the past several months suggest a split between people who point to Trump’s record during his term and others who want Trump to endorse a national abortion ban.\nTrump has so far declined to go along with some of his rivals, including his onetime vice president, Mike Pence, who is pushing for national bans that would take effect relatively early in a pregnancy. He’s warned Republicans against locking themselves into positions that are unpopular with a majority of the public and has argued that the Supreme Court’s decision gives abortion opponents the right to “negotiate” restrictions where they live rather than rely on federal bans.\nThe Supreme Court ruling left the decision of whether and how to restrict abortion to the states, creating a patchwork of laws across the country, with most Republican-led states imposing new restrictions and states led by Democrats passing protections. Twenty-five million women of childbearing age now live in states where abortions are more difficult to get since before the ruling.\nTrump also has approached the issue from a political stance, saying that the court’s ruling and Republicans’ push for abortion restrictions hurt the GOP in the 2022 midterm elections and that GOP candidates need to do a better job of explaining the issue.\nRepublicans in some key states, including those backing his rivals, expressed displeasure.\nAmong them was South Carolina state Rep. John McCravy, who sponsored the most recent, restrictive abortion measure, which bans the practice in his state after around six weeks of pregnancy. South Carolina will be among the early states to choose a nominee.\n“I was certainly disappointed with what I heard from President Trump today concerning the Florida Heartbeat Bill,” McCravy told The Associated Press, after watching Trump’s interview. “It sounded completely out of step with his staunch support for life while he was president.”\nMcCravy has endorsed South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott in the 2024 GOP presidential primary but told AP last week, “Trump would probably be a close second, noting his Supreme Court appointments and his attending the March for Life rally in Washington.\n“Hopefully he will re-think and clarify his position concerning life and the Heartbeat Bill after the political fallout which is sure to come,” McCravy said.\nOne of the anti-abortion leaders in the battleground state of Arizona posted a segment of the “Meet the Press” interview on X. Cathi Herrod, president of the Center for Arizona Policy, wrote that Trump “has abandoned the pro-life movement.”\n“Watch this in its entirety,” Herrod wrote. “He criticizes Ron DeSantis for signing heartbeat bill. Won’t commit to a position. Unacceptable. Time to move on.”\nKristen Waggoner, CEO of the conservative legal organization Alliance Defending Freedom, also took issue. “Laws protecting the unborn are not a ‘terrible mistake.’ They are the hallmark of a just and moral society,” she wrote on X. “Governors who protect life should be applauded, not attacked.”"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 120, "end": 208}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 320, "end": 483}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 358, "end": 368}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 913, "end": 918}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1978, "end": 2014}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2044, "end": 2232}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2484, "end": 2606}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2860, "end": 2980}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2860, "end": 3162}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4191, "end": 4246}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4435, "end": 4511}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4614, "end": 4698}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5020, "end": 5293}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5896, "end": 6002}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6031, "end": 6289}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6292, "end": 6498}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6722, "end": 6985}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 7008, "end": 7029}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 7203, "end": 7399}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 7792, "end": 8335}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 8338, "end": 8511}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 8882, "end": 9001}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 9005, "end": 9231}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 9968, "end": 9987}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 10018, "end": 10099}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 10497, "end": 10682}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 10685, "end": 10708}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 11004, "end": 11114}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 12440, "end": 12501}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 12504, "end": 12604}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 12504, "end": 12533}], "article_id": "42107", "lang": "en", "text": "Myth vs. Reality in COVID Russia\n\nIt's time to part ways with the conscience-soothing fairytales\n\n“Sputnik V is safe!”; “Putin is just ‘playing along’ with the COVID narrative until the petrodollar collapses!”; “Russia is the last bastion of freedom!”…\nAlternative media has created an alternative reality about Russia. The Kremlin has embraced all the same soul-raping “public health measures” currently terrorizing the Western world—and people are either in denial or making excuses:\n\n“There is no compulsory vaccination in Russia!”\nAll 85 federal subjects of the Russian Federation now have vaccine mandates, as well as rules requiring digital “health” certificates for entry to certain businesses, venues, and public institutions. Many regions are denying routine medical care to those without QR codes.\nAt the federal level, the Kremlin has voiced support for “any measures” that “encourage” Russians to get jabbed—while insisting vaccination remains completely voluntary.\nA sample of regional flavors of “voluntary” vaccination in Russia:\nIn the Novgorod region, children whose parents have not been vaccinated are banned from afterschool clubs and other extracurricular activities.\nDigital vaccine passports will be required to use public transport in Tatarstan. The new regulation applies to all residents over the age of 18 without a medical exemption.\nIn St. Petersburg, a negative PCR test cannot be used to obtain a QR code. This means theaters, museums and restaurants in Russia’s second-largest city are reserved exclusively for the vaccinated and those with proof of prior infection.\nMuscovites over the age of 60 have been ordered to self-isolate until the end of February. Those who have been vaccinated or have proof of prior infection are exempt from the rule.\nProbably you read somewhere that Vladimir Putin outlawed compulsory vaccination as part of his master plan to destroy the fractional reserve banking system and bring peace and harmony to the world. Someone lied to you. Sorry about that.\n\n“…But Sputnik V is safe!”\nDoes the Kremlin have access to a time-bending wormhole? Because we keep reading boastful claims about the non-existent results of Sputnik V’s “long-term” (ha-ha) safety and efficacy trials—which are scheduled to end on December 31, 2022.\nLike other COVID vaccines, Sputnik V has zoomed through clinical trials, with an “interim” report consisting of six months’ worth of data used as proof of its unassailable long-term safety and efficacy. It didn’t help that this already limited dataset was plagued by controversy (as well as an alarming lack of transparency).\nPhase III vaccine trials typically require at least five years of careful observation. For example, the long-term safety study for J&J’s Ebola vaccine—which uses the same Ad26 viral vector platform as Sputnik V—began in 2016 and won’t end until 2023.\nAlexander Redko, chairman of the St. Petersburg Professional Association of Medical Workers, noted in July that declaring Sputnik V “safe” without even waiting for ludicrous-speed clinical trials to end is about as scientific as reading tarot cards. Is he wrong? The Russian government clearly thinks so.\nIn December 2020, Russia’s health ministry announced it was prematurely ending enrollment for Sputnik V trials, arguing that it would be unethical to administer placebo shots when a proven, life-saving vaccine was already available to the public.\n“Everything has now been proven, while the pandemic is ongoing,” Alexander Gintsburg, director of the Gamaleya Center—which developed Sputnik V—explained, just four months after Phase III trials had begun.\nScience-deniers claim it’s irresponsible to coerce tens of millions of people to get injected with an untested drug, but what these conspiracy theorists don’t understand is that any long-term issues would have become apparent within four months.\nFurthermore, Russia has a robust and transparent system in place for flagging side effects.\nThe Russian government does not have a VAERS-like database for reporting and monitoring suspected adverse reactions, and doctors who question the vaccine’s safety or efficacy are being threatened with exorbitant fines and prison time.\n“The fact is that nothing is registered in Russia at all. Therefore, it is very difficult to understand how many serious complications there are. There are many cases, and we can say that they are related to the vaccine. There is a lot to say. Or you can stick your head in the sand and say that there is nothing at all,” Pavel Vorobyov, Chairman of the Moscow Scientific Society of Physicians, said in a recent interview, making him an anti-science hate speech criminal in the eyes of the Russian government.\nArgentina’s health ministry is similarly guilty of High Crimes Against Sputnik V. In October, the South American state revealed that Russia’s flagship vaccine was the nation’s leader when it came to causing adverse reactions, beating Sinopharm and AstraZeneca by significant margins (the full report can be read here):\nThere are even thought crimes being carried out by Russia’s elected representatives. Duma Deputy Mikhail Delyagin argued in an August op-ed that the government’s own data suggested that mass compulsory vaccination had no clear neutralizing effect and was making things worse.\nFor months, the Russian government maintained it was basically impossible to be hospitalized with COVID if you were fully vaccinated. When it became obvious that this was a slight exaggeration, Gamaleya’s director claimed 80% of jabbed Russians falling ill with the virus had purchased fake certificates and were lying about their vaccination status. Gintsburg’s tall tale inspired some colorful commentary in Russian media. As one outlet opined:\nAt first they said that it was enough to get vaccinated once every two years so as not to get sick at all, then once a year, then once every six months. Now it turns out that vaccination does not even really protect against getting into intensive care or death.\nAnd what is the solution? True, the Minister of Health, Mr. Murashko, still claims that there are no deaths among citizens who have received the vaccine. But people do not live on Mars, they, alas, face these deaths of the vaccinated in life ... And then the PR naturally stops working.\nIt’s doubtful if the PR ever worked. Last month, Deputy Speaker of the State Duma Pyotr Tolstoy conceded that the government had completely failed to convince the public that Sputnik V was safe and effective.\n“There are few answers to the questions why those who are vaccinated are ill, why those who are vaccinated die, why there are problems and complications after the vaccinations themselves,” the high-ranking lawmaker said.\nThe total lack of transparency has spurred the creation of informal databases and Telegram channels where adverse events can be tracked. Instead of stepping up efforts to address safety concerns, the Russian government has compared concerned citizens to terrorists.\nThe Kremlin and its credulous cheerleaders maintain that there’s no need to worry about long-term safety because Sputnik V is based on the Gamaleya Center’s proven, time-tested viral vector-based delivery platform. For example, Kirill Dmitriev, the Harvard-educated ex-Goldman Sachs banker who heads the Russian Direct Investment Fund (which provides financing for Sputnik V), claimed in an op-ed published by RT:\nRussia has benefitted from modifying for COVID-19 an existing two-vector vaccine platform developed in 2015 for Ebola fever, which went through all phases of clinical trials and was used to help defeat the Ebola epidemic in Africa in 2017.\nBut on Sputnik V’s website, we learn:\nAbout 2,000 people in Guinea received injections of Ebola vaccine in 2017-18 as part of Phase 3 clinical trial.\nIs Dmitriev really suggesting that a Phase III trial held in 2017-18 helped Guinea defeat Ebola? That’s quite a brave claim, considering Guinea was declared Ebola-free in June 2016 following an outbreak two years earlier. By the time Gamaleya’s magic Ebola slurry arrived in Guinea (as part of a clinical trial), there was no Ebola left to fight. In February of this year, Guinea reported its first Ebola death since 2016. Can Dmitriev or RT offer some clarification here? Send your questions to RT’s famously fearless and objective Russia Desk.\nBy the way: why would Dmitriev (and Sputnik V’s own website) brag about injecting 2,000 Africans as part of a clinical trial held a year after Guinea was declared Ebola-free? Well, because that’s basically Gamaleya’s greatest triumph—before inventing Sputnik V in record-time.\nSputnik V is the Gamaleya Center’s first “viral vector-based” vaccine to receive emergency use authorization outside of Russia. Gintsburg—who has been the director of Gamaleya since 1997—has yet to bring a fully approved vaccine to market, despite multiple attempts.\nIn fact, Gintsburg’s first vector adenovirus vaccine, AdeVac-Flu, resulted in a multimillion-dollar embezzlement scandal.\n“[Gamaleya’s] scientists have ‘copy-pasted’ [Sputnik V] from their previous, not accepted by the scientific community, research. In their genetic memory—a criminal case, WHO skepticism and zero drugs introduced into the market,” read the teaser of an investigation published by fontanka.ru in July 2020.\nWith such an impressive track record, it’s hardly surprising that the Gamaleya Center refers to itself as “the world’s leading research institution.” The Center also has world-leading facilities. Seriously, feast your eyes upon these cutting-edge facilities: [photos showing an older building with some water damage]\nA lot of Russians are also very impressed by the fact that Sputnik V’s #1 fan (and one of the drug’s original investors) is a friendly banker who is trying to introduce a QR code-based payment system in Russia, and is also developing a digital currency in partnership with JP Morgan.\nWhen your favorite WordPress geopolitical analyst exclaims “Sputnik V is safe!” the appropriate response is: how could you possibly know, and why does the Russian government not want to know?\n\n“…But the Russian government would never deceive its own people!”\nIn June, the emergence of a highly deadly “Moscow strain”—later deemed a “hypothetical phenomenon”—forced authorities to introduce Russia’s first vaccine mandate in the capital. Other regions followed suit. Yes, the people grumbled—but COVID “cases” immediately began to plummet! COVID “deaths” plateaued! It was a true miracle.\nThen something really strange happened: the amazingly effective (but highly unpopular) coercive COVID policies suddenly stopped working immediately after Duma elections in late September.\nWhat a weird coincidence. Obviously, the ruling United Russia party—which had just secured parliament for another five years after an unexpectedly decisive electoral victory—was forced to impose even more coercive COVID policies. If Russians don’t like it, they can express their dissatisfaction at the polls, in 2026.\nRussia’s descent into compulsory vaccination is a case study in industrial-scale lying and government duplicity. It’s a very interesting story.\n\n“…But…but…Putin!”\nIn January, Russia’s president presented a keynote address at the World Economic Forum—his first speech before the esteemed international body since 2009.\nBeginning his address with a very friendly and intimate “dear Klaus,” Putin recalled how he first met Mr. Schwab in 1992 and since then had regularly attended events organized by the Fourth Industrial Revolution visionary.\nPutin used this very important speech to call for “expanding the scale of testing and vaccinations” around the world, describing COVID as an existential threat that required close international cooperation. The entire global economy will need to be rebuilt from the ground up by central banks, because the virus is just so deadly and destructive:\n[T]he key question today is how to build a program of actions in order to not only quickly restore the global and national economies affected by the pandemic, but to ensure that this recovery is sustainable in the long run, relies on a high-quality structure and helps overcome the burden of social imbalances. Clearly, with the above restrictions and macroeconomic policy in mind, economic growth will largely rely on fiscal incentives with state budgets and central banks playing the key role.\nIs that how you say “Build Back Better” in Russian?\nWe’re all trapped in the same oligarch-controlled panpoopticon. Maybe it’s time to accept that, instead of pretending that some jailers are more “based” than others?\nCrazy times.

And it’s an attempt to undermine the work of the COP28 presidency,” Jaber told a news conference on Wednesday.\nJaber has said the phase-down of fossil fuels is “inevitable”, but also that the industry needs to be included in the debate of finding climate solutions and presented himself as ideally placed to mediate.\nClimate campaigners are not reassured.\n“We have a world which has more fossil fuels than ever,” said Ani Dasgupta, President of the World Resources Institute, a climate NGO. “What we should be looking for is a commitment to actually reduce fossil fuels.”\nJaber says he has been rallying support from companies for COP28 pledges aimed at reducing emissions from oil and gas operations.\nMany representatives of the industry will be present in Dubai as this year’s gathering of 70,000 registered attendees takes on the character of trade show.\nOrganisers say the record attendance will include the biggest business participation for any UN climate summit yet.\nIndian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, and Britain’s King Charles are also set to attend, although US President Joe Biden will not.\n\nTaking stock\nAway from the high-profile visitors, a major task for the country delegations at COP28 will be to assess how far off track the world is from a goal set in Paris in 2015 to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), while aiming for a cap of 1.5C.\nThis process, known as the global stocktake, should yield a high-level plan telling countries what they need to do.\nGovernments will then have to turn that global plan into national policies and targets to submit to the UN in 2025.\nLeading up to the conference, the European Union, US and UAE have rallied support for a deal to triple global renewable energy installed by 2030. Over 100 countries have backed this deal, officials told Reuters, but countries including China and India have not.\nUS officials and others are hopeful a climate deal agreed earlier this month between the world’s biggest emitters, China and the US, may also set a positive tone for the talks.\nThe two countries agreed to boost renewable energy and “accelerate the substitution for coal, oil and gas generation”.\n\nClimate finance\nAnother task for the conference is to launch the world’s first climate damage fund to help countries that have already suffered irreparable damage from climate change impacts, such as drought, floods and rising sea levels.\nRepresentatives from developed and developing countries have struck a tentative agreement on its design, but all countries at COP28 need to approve it for it to lead to a final deal.\nGayane Gabrielyan, Armenia’s negotiator on the fund, told Reuters it is crucial the “loss and damage” fund agreement is approved now, ahead of elections next year in countries, such as the US, that could shatter the political consensus.\nAnother test is whether wealthy nations announce hundreds of millions of dollars needed to launch the fund at COP28.

If you look closely you can see clues: fingers that curl oddly, or eyes that shimmer with an unnatural light — all telltale signs of digital deception.\nThe outrage the images were created to provoke, however, is all too real.\nPictures from the Israel-Hamas war have vividly and painfully illustrated AI’s potential as a propaganda tool, used to create lifelike images of carnage. Since the war began last month, digitally altered ones spread on social media have been used to make false claims about responsibility for casualties or to deceive people about atrocities that never happened.\nWhile most of the false claims circulating online about the war didn’t require AI to create and came from more conventional sources, technological advances are coming with increasing frequency and little oversight. That’s made the potential of AI to become another form of weapon starkly apparent, and offered a glimpse of what’s to come during future conflicts, elections and other big events.\n“It’s going to get worse — a lot worse — before it gets better,” said Jean-Claude Goldenstein, CEO of CREOpoint, a tech company based in San Francisco and Paris that uses AI to assess the validity of online claims. The company has created a database of the most viral deepfakes to emerge from Gaza. “Pictures, video and audio: with generative AI it’s going to be an escalation you haven’t seen.”\nIn some cases, photos from other conflicts or disasters have been repurposed and passed off as new. In others, generative AI programs have been used to create images from scratch, such as one of a baby crying amidst bombing wreckage that went viral in the conflict’s earliest days.\nOther examples of AI-generated images include videos showing supposed Israeli missile strikes, or tanks rolling through ruined neighborhoods, or families combing through rubble for survivors.\nIn many cases, the fakes seem designed to evoke a strong emotional reaction by including the bodies of babies, children or families. In the bloody first days of the war, supporters of both Israel and Hamas alleged the other side had victimized children and babies; deepfake images of wailing infants offered photographic ‘evidence’ that was quickly held up as proof.\nThe propagandists who create such images are skilled at targeting people’s deepest impulses and anxieties, said Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit that has tracked disinformation from the war. Whether it’s a deepfake baby, or an actual image of an infant from another conflict, the emotional impact on the viewer is the same.\nThe more abhorrent the image, the more likely a user is to remember it and to share it, unwittingly spreading the disinformation further.\n“People are being told right now: Look at this picture of a baby,” Ahmed said. “The disinformation is designed to make you engage with it.”\nSimilarly deceptive AI-generated content began to spread after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. One altered video appeared to show Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ordering Ukrainians to surrender. Such claims have continued to circulate as recently as last week, showing just how persistent even easily debunked misinformation can be.\nEach new conflict, or election season, provides new opportunities for disinformation peddlers to demonstrate the latest AI advances. That has many AI experts and political scientists warning of the risks next year, when several countries hold major elections, including the U.S., India, Pakistan, Ukraine, Taiwan, Indonesia and Mexico.\nThe risk that AI and social media could be used to spread lies to U.S. voters has alarmed lawmakers from both parties in Washington. At a recent hearing on the dangers of deepfake technology, U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, said the U.S. must invest in funding the development of AI tools designed to counter other AI.\n“We as a nation need to get this right,” Connolly said.\nAround the world a number of startup tech firms are working on new programs that can sniff out deepfakes, affix watermarks to images to prove their origin, or scan text to verify any specious claims that may have been inserted by AI.\n“The next wave of AI will be: How can we verify the content that is out there. How can you detect misinformation, how can you analyze text to determine if it is trustworthy?” said Maria Amelie, co-founder of Factiverse, a Norwegian company that has created an AI program that can scan content for inaccuracies or bias introduced by other AI programs.\nSuch programs would be of immediate interest to educators, journalists, financial analysts and others interested in rooting out falsehoods, plagiarism or fraud. Similar programs are being designed to sniff out doctored photos or video.\nWhile this technology shows promise, those using AI to lie are often a step ahead, according to David Doermann, a computer scientist who led an effort at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to respond to the national security threats posed by AI-manipulated images.\nDoermann, who is now a professor at the University at Buffalo, said effectively responding to the political and social challenges posed by AI disinformation will require both better technology and better regulations, voluntary industry standards and extensive investments in digital literacy programs to help internet users figure out ways to tell truth from fantasy.\n“Every time we release a tool that detects this, our adversaries can use AI to cover up that trace evidence,” said Doermann. “Detection and trying to pull this stuff down is no longer the solution. We need to have a much bigger solution.”"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 0, "end": 76}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 79, "end": 186}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 190, "end": 451}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 577, "end": 767}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 620, "end": 633}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 915, "end": 1053}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1204, "end": 1225}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 1669, "end": 1770}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 1773, "end": 1986}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 1989, "end": 2210}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2229, "end": 2622}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2282, "end": 2293}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2515, "end": 2536}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2956, "end": 2966}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3631, "end": 3959}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3962, "end": 4382}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3989, "end": 3995}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4326, "end": 4347}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 4385, "end": 4616}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4620, "end": 4764}], "article_id": "42112", "lang": "en", "text": "AOC: GOP Would Rather Sacrifice Child Labor Laws Than Allow Legal Immigration\n\nRepublicans “would rather roll back child labor laws … than allow immigrants into their community,” she said.\n\nRepublicans are aiming to erode legal immigration pathways as part of their latest attacks on immigration, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) warned this week as the White House negotiates an immigration deal with the GOP to prevent a government shutdown.\nOn social media, Ocasio-Cortez highlighted a portion of a House Oversight Committee hearing on immigration from Wednesday, emphasizing that conservatives, amid their fear mongering and racist rhetoric on immigration, often ignore that welcoming immigration policies typically have a stimulating effect on economies.\n“Historically, the United States has economically outperformed other countries in part due to our welcoming of immigrants,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “Republicans would like you to believe that they support legal immigration, but today, they launched an attack on legal immigration pathways.”\nIn the clip of her remarks at the hearing, she asks Cato Institute associate director of Immigration Studies David J. Bier, who is critical of the conservative crackdown on immigration, how countries typically fare when they close their borders as Republicans are trying to do. Bier brought up the example of Japan, which in recent years has been forced to accept more immigrants to address acute labor shortages after many years of being one of the most restrictive wealthy countries on immigration policy.\nOcasio-Cortez went on to highlight similar labor shortages that are currently cropping up in the U.S. — but said that Republicans would rather put children in danger by eroding child labor laws to fill jobs.\n“Many of these Republican legislatures would rather roll back child labor laws and put 11 and 13 year olds back in the workplace than allow immigrants into their community and do what they’ve always done,” she said.\nRather, Congress must back policy “that can be documented, that people can get a job, put a shirt on their back, support their kids without being a public charge, and defend the very soul of what it means to be an American,” she concluded.\nIndeed, while Republicans are seeking stricter — and deeply cruel — restrictions on illegal immigration at the southern border, they are also seeking to curtail a major policy known as humanitarian parole, which the Biden administration has been using to allow people in countries with unstable and dangerous conditions to fly straight to the U.S., rather than entering from the southern border.\nLast year, after announcing that the policy applied to immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, the administration allowed over 200,000 people into the U.S. under parole status, which does not typically provide pathways to permanent residence. But it has still historically provided relief to people from countries in dire crises, often brought on by U.S. military intervention, with humanitarian parole being used to admit people from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos in the 1970s, Iraq in the 1990s, and Afghanistan in 2021, for instance.\nIndeed, a recent FWD.us report found that roughly 1.1 million immigrants on parole between 2021 and 2023 were a major boon to a wide variety of industries like construction, transportation, manufacturing, health care, and other fields that have been experiencing shortages. The research found that this section of the workforce collectively reduced the number of open job positions in industries with shortages by a third from early 2022 to the end of 2023.\nWhile humanitarian parole has helped solve labor shortage issues and been a lifeline for many immigrants, Republicans in recent government funding deal discussions are seeking to limit the administration’s use of the policy — despite their protestations in public that they welcome legal immigration, as Ocasio-Cortez pointed out.\nRepublicans also put their cruelty on immigration policy on display during the hearing. At one point, one Republican representative said that “we want family separation” in order to supposedly ensure that children who are separated from their parents are actually with their parents — a baffling admission based on a narrative that is almost entirely removed from the horrific realities of family separation at the border.\nDemocrats in the hearing said that Republicans’ immigration policy isn’t based on humane and strategic solutions, but rather on creating more issues for immigrants and crises at the southern border in order to score political points.\n“It has become obvious that [Donald] Trump’s party doesn’t want immigration solutions at the border, they want immigration problems to run against,” Rep.

The sky looked hazy with smoke from the Mosquito Fire, which had already consumed tens of thousands of acres of forest in the eastern part of the state.\nThis particular fire burned more than 100 miles from Santa Rosa, a bucolic city in the heart of California’s wine country. But over the last five years, multiple wildfires have impacted Santa Rosa and the surrounding countryside. In 2017, a string of fires was estimated to have caused as much as $7 billion of damage in the city, destroying thousands of homes.\nThis pattern has played out across California — 12 of the state’s 20 largest wildfires have burned in the last five years. While California has mismanaged its forests, which contributes to the increase in wildfires, researchers agree that rising global temperatures make fires both more frequent and harder to control. Thousands of Californians have evacuated their homes in recent years; many have been permanently displaced. Even in places untouched by fire itself, smoke and particulate matter choke out clean air.\n“It’s scary. Scary. Very scary,” says Kenneth Gray, a Navy veteran at Windsor Veterans Village who has been without permanent shelter during previous wildfires. “You don’t know if you’re going to be running for your life or not. The only other experience I can relate that to is being on the flight deck of a carrier during flight ops.”\nWindsor Veterans Village offers apartments to veterans experiencing homelessness. In 2020, more than a quarter of the country’s unhoused population — and more than 30% of all unhoused veterans — lived in California. Other states — like Texas, which in recent years has been battered by hurricanes, severe heat waves, and a historic deep freeze last winter — also have their share of unhoused veterans. As climate change wreaks havoc on the weather in these places, the effects on veterans and others living outside can be catastrophic.\n“Disasters definitely have a disproportionate effect on those that are marginalized,” says Eric Samuels, who runs the Texas Homeless Network, which works to end homelessness in the state.\nExtreme weather is on the rise around the world. While being displaced by a tornado or flooded out in a hurricane can be devastating for anyone, for those living without guaranteed shelter, these events can make daily life effectively impossible — and can delay access to needed resources and support.\nUnhoused people often find themselves on the frontlines of the effects of fires, floods, and extreme temperatures as weather changes around the world. In recent years, damaging weather and related natural disasters have increased in both frequency and severity, driven by climate change. Hurricanes are getting stronger. Storms are dropping more rain. Sea level rise contributes to higher storm surges, increasing flooding. In the western part of the country, a “megadrought” — the worst in more than a thousand years — continues. The worsening California wildfire seasons have been spurred in part by rising temperatures.\nVeterans are disproportionately represented among people experiencing homelessness, even after more than a decade of improvement. And while unhoused veterans may have access to resources that other people experiencing homelessness do not, they also tend to have more complex physical and mental health conditions that can make bouncing back from disaster even more difficult.\n“Veterans are still coping with the aftermath of the fires,” says Mary Haynes, who leads the Northern California branch of Nation’s Finest, which runs Windsor Veterans Village. “For the unsheltered, it’s very, very difficult.”\n\n‘It would be considered a mass casualty event’\nIn the United States, veterans make up about 7% of the population but 13% of people experiencing homelessness. That’s a drastic improvement from a decade ago. Concerted efforts to identify and house veterans have cut veteran homelessness by more than half in the last 12 years. But the pandemic and high rates of inflation have increased economic insecurity, and even veterans with housing can be at risk of homelessness: Nearly 13% of housed veterans report income at or below 150% of the poverty line. According to research by the Bob Woodruff Foundation, half of all veterans between the ages of 25 and 54 say they have less than $4,000 in their bank account.\nVeterans are overrepresented among the homeless population for a number of reasons, says Blake Harris, who runs the mental health department for the Texas Veterans Commission. Veterans may be more likely to experience trauma, which correlates with homelessness. And they have higher rates of traumatic brain injuries, which can be a risk factor. Veterans experiencing homelessness also tend to be older, Harris says.\n“They may have fewer supports in terms of family and friends and other folks that can also lend a hand,” Harris says. “They also have barriers to being employed. The kind of overarching thing is the amplification of all the risk factors that are there for your general civilian unsheltered person.”\nIn general, unhoused people receive less health care than housed people. While people living outside struggle with many of the same ailments as the overall population, those problems are often worse, says Tipu Khan, a physician who works with unhoused people in Southern California.\n“Some of the bread-and-butter stuff is still an issue,” Khan says, pointing to chronic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure. “What I think tend to be more prominent in this population is those issues tend to be a little bit more uncontrolled. So we tend to see more complications of the diabetes, of the high blood pressure, because they don’t have access to regular care.”\nIn severe heat, like parts of this summer when more than half the U.S. population was under a heat warning or advisory, unhoused people face higher rates of heatstroke and kidney failure — severe dehydration can lead to decreased kidney function. Heat and fatigue exacerbate chronic conditions, and heat-related deaths have risen in recent years in the United States. In 2021, in Maricopa County, Arizona, where temperatures often reach into the triple digits, 130 unhoused people died from heat-related causes — about double the number who died in 2019.\n“If 130 homeless people were dying in any other way, it would be considered a mass casualty event,” Kristie Ebi, a professor of global health at the University of Washington, told The Associated Press.\nSimilarly, in extreme cold — such as the winter storms that swept across Texas in February 2021, pushing temperatures to single digits in some parts of the state — unsheltered people can bear the brunt of the chill. Across the state, at least 246 people died because of the storms, most of them from exposure.\nHomelessness is worsening in the United States, and severe weather affects everyone without stable housing. But veterans provide a microcosm for looking at the crisis — and is a population that can be particularly impacted by these weather events. Disasters and severe weather events can retraumatize some veterans. Harris has worked with veterans who served in the Middle East who struggle during heat waves.\n“We’ve had some experience working with veterans that will say, ‘You know it’s really hot out there,’” Harris says. “It can kind of bring them back to some of the experiences they may have gone through in the desert. So it can be triggering in and of itself.”\nVeterans may also be more reluctant to accept help or move into shelters, even during emergencies. “They don’t trust the system often, because the system has failed them,” Khan says. “So when they hear, ‘Hey, we’re with the county hospital,’ I think that’s a turn-off, initially.”\nEven absent those additional factors, moving inside to safety, when possible, may be more difficult for unhoused people than for those with houses. People who live outside often rely on pets for protection and companionship, but many homeless shelters don’t accept animals. And leaving behind belongings can be devastating and destabilizing. When an evacuation order comes down, people who live inside can often pack some essentials to take with them when they go — leaving the rest of their belongings inside their homes and hoping for the best. People experiencing homelessness, by contrast, typically do not have a safe place to leave their belongings, and taking everything with them to a shelter often isn’t an option.\n“They’re carrying everything valuable to them with them,” Harris says. “So a lot of folks are almost root-bound to the spots that they find, where all their stuff is with them. … How do you pack up your entire life and take it with you?”\n\n‘It multiplies everything by a factor of a thousand’\nIn 2017, when Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas as a Category 4 storm, it dropped more than four feet of rain in parts of the state and spawned dozens of tornadoes. About 32,000 people were displaced, and more than 210,000 people requested disaster assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n“When Harvey hit, we had thousands of people who were in shelters,” Samuels says. “They sent people to San Antonio, Dallas, Austin, Fort Worth. We even had some people go to Amarillo. So automatically, those agencies in those cities are doubled or tripled in terms of capacity.”\nDuring a natural disaster, the systems people experiencing homelessness rely on for services can be overloaded with an influx of people who previously did not need support. First responders, hospitals, shelters, and community organizations can be overwhelmed, leaving unhoused people with fewer places to turn for food, shelter, or medical care.\n“Case managers are used to dealing with disasters,” Samuels says. “But these large-scale disasters that happen to multiple households and individuals — it just multiplies everything by a factor of a thousand.”\nOrganizations that serve homeless populations must prepare for worst-case scenarios, says June Gin, a Veterans Affairs researcher who studies disaster preparedness in homeless services organizations. When an emergency arises, local officials often offer guidance aimed at people with stable housing.\n“Everybody tells us you have to have three days’ worth of food and water stored,” Gin says. “[Unhoused people] obviously can’t store anything, barely.”\nProviders should also think through the situations that will be particularly hard for people living outside or in unstable situations. In California, for instance, frequent triple-digit heat waves and wildfires encroaching on urban areas pose newer threats.\n“I would say the challenge is that maybe they haven’t always been recognized as disasters,” Gin says. “I think that there were a lot of people who sort of thought, Well, we’re preparing for earthquakes.”\nIn this case, unhoused veterans may have an advantage. VA-funded organizations that provide transitional housing for veterans must have updated disaster plans. And VA often has resources to support veterans after an emergency. “It’s great to have the VA in your corner,” Gin says. In fact, she says, disasters can provide an opportunity to connect veterans to resources or benefits they didn’t know about or have access to before an emergency.\nBut that cuts both ways, Harris says.\n“There are a lot of resources for veterans through the VA, and then through state partners, and then through community organizations who are invested in serving those who have served,” he says. “However, there is also, at the same time, a misconception among many folks that, ‘Well, they’re taken care of by the VA,’ or, ‘The VA takes care of all their needs.’ And that’s not necessarily the case.”\nUltimately, stable housing for veterans provides the best long-term solution. At Windsor Veterans Village, Robert, a Navy veteran who lived outside for 27 years in Northern California before learning he qualified for an apartment last year, says living outside in extreme conditions is never easy.\n“It’s hard in the wintertime,” he says. “If you don’t have blankets, you can’t stay warm. Shower facilities are practically nonexistent.” During heat waves, following medical advice — stay hydrated, stay cool — isn’t necessarily possible. “There’s not always water available. There’s not always shade available. Especially in that kind of heat, because everybody’s running for shade.”\nWhen the temperatures reached the triple digits earlier in the week, Robert says, for the first time, he was able to hunker down in his own space. His new place stays so cool that he turned on the air conditioning for only a couple of hours.\nHe spent the heat wave cleaning his apartment."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 0, "end": 69}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 72, "end": 265}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 283, "end": 626}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 1056, "end": 1609}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1779, "end": 2049}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2051, "end": 2304}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2521, "end": 2604}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2776, "end": 2847}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 2850, "end": 2877}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2893, "end": 2909}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2913, "end": 3519}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 3820, "end": 3916}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3919, "end": 4003}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4221, "end": 4511}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 4741, "end": 4904}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 5023, "end": 5223}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 5463, "end": 5598}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 5601, "end": 6122}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6340, "end": 6755}], "article_id": "42116", "lang": "en", "text": "How Lawmakers in Texas and Florida Undermine Covid Vaccination Efforts\n\nKatherine Wells wants to urge her Lubbock, Texas, community to get vaccinated against covid-19. “That could really save people from severe illness,” said Wells, the city’s public health director.\nBut she can’t.\nA rule added to Texas’ budget that went into effect Sept. 1 forbids health departments and other organizations funded by the state government to advertise, recommend, or even list covid vaccines alone. “Clinics may inform patients that COVID-19 vaccinations are available,” the rule allows, “if it is not being singled out from other vaccines.”\nTexas isn’t the only state curtailing the public conversation about covid vaccines. Tennessee’s health department homepage, for example, features the flu, vaping, and cancer screening but leaves out covid and covid vaccines. Florida is an extreme case, where the health department has issued guidance against covid vaccines that runs counter to scientific studies and advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nNotably, the shift in health information trails rhetoric from primarily Republican politicians who have reversed their positions on covid vaccines. Fierce opposition to measures like masking and business closures early in the pandemic fueled a mistrust of the CDC and other scientific institutions and often falls along party lines: Last month, a KFF poll found that 84% of Democrats said they were confident in the safety of covid vaccines, compared with 36% of Republicans. It’s a dramatic drop from 2021, when two-thirds of Republicans were vaccinated.\nAs new vaccines roll out ahead of the expected winter surge of covid, some health officials are treading carefully to avoid blowback from the public and policymakers. So far, vaccine uptake is low, with less than 5% of Americans receiving an updated shot, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Wells fears the consequences will be dire: “We will see a huge disparity in health outcomes because of changes in language.”\nA study published in July found that Republicans and Democrats in Ohio and Florida died at roughly similar rates before covid vaccines emerged, but a disparity between parties grew once the first vaccines were widely available in 2021 and uptake diverged. By year’s end, Republicans had a 43% higher rate of excess deaths than Democrats.\nPublic health initiatives have long been divisive — water fluoridation, needle exchanges, and universal health care, to name a few. But the pandemic turned up the volume to painful levels, public health officials say. More than 500 left their jobs under duress in 2020 and 2021, and legislators in at least 26 states passed laws to prevent public officials from setting health policies. Republican Arkansas state Sen. Trent Garner told KFF Health News in 2021, “It’s time to take the power away from the so-called experts.”\nAt first, vaccine mandates were contentious but the shots themselves were not. Scott Rivkees, Florida’s former surgeon general, now at Brown University, traces the shift to the months after Joe Biden was elected president. Though Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis initially promoted covid vaccination, his stance changed as resistance to covid measures became central to his presidential campaign. In late 2021, he appointed Joseph Ladapo surgeon general. By then, Ladapo had penned Wall Street Journal op-eds skeptical of mainstream medical advice, such as one asking, “Are Covid Vaccines Riskier Than Advertised?”\nAs bivalent boosters rolled out last year, the Florida health department’s homepage removed information on covid vaccines. In its place were rules against mandates and details on how to obtain vaccine exemptions. Then, early this year, the department advised against vaccinating children and teens.\nThe state’s advice changed once more when the CDC recommended updated covid vaccines in September. DeSantis incorrectly said the vaccines had “not been proven to be safe or effective.” And the health department amended its guidance to say men under age 40 should not be vaccinated because the department had conducted research and deemed the risk of heart complications like myocarditis unacceptable. It refers to a short, authorless document posted online rather than in a scientific journal where it would have been vetted for accuracy. The report uses an unusual method to analyze health records of vaccinated Floridians. Citing serious flaws, most other researchers call it misinformation.\nScientifically vetted studies, and the CDC’s own review, contradict Florida’s conclusion against vaccination. Cases of myocarditis following mRNA vaccines have occurred but are much less frequent than cases triggered by covid. The risk is sevenfold higher from the disease than from mRNA vaccines, according to an analysis published in a medical journal based on a review of 22 other studies.\nSince leaving his post, Rivkees has been stunned to see the state health department subsumed by political meddling.\nAbout 28,700 children and adults from birth to age 39 have died of covid in the United States. Florida’s anti-vaccine messaging affects people of all ages, Rivkees added, not just those who are younger.\nHe points out that Florida performed well compared with other states in 2020 and 2021, ranking 38th in covid deaths per capita despite a large population of older adults. Now it has the sixth-highest rate of covid deaths in the country.\n“There is no question that the rise of misinformation and the politicization of the response has taken a toll on public health,” he said.\nAs in Florida, the Texas health department initially promoted covid vaccines, warning that Texans who weren’t vaccinated were about 20 times as likely to suffer a covid-associated death. Such sentiments faded last year, as state leaders passed policies to block vaccine mandates and other public health measures. The latest is a prohibition against the use of government funds to promote covid vaccines. Uptake in Texas is already low, with fewer than 4% of residents getting the bivalent booster that rolled out last year.\nAt Lubbock’s health department, Wells managed to put out a press release saying the city offers covid vaccines but stopped short of recommending them. “We aren’t able to do as big a push as other states,” she said.\nSome health officials are altering their recommendations, given the current climate. Janet Hamilton, executive director at the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, said clear-cut advice to get vaccinated against covid works when people trust the scientific establishment, but it risks driving others away from all vaccines. “It’s important for public health to meet people where they are,” Hamilton said.\nMissouri’s health department took this tack on X, formerly known as Twitter: “COVID vaccines will be available in Missouri soon, if you’re in to that sort of thing. If not, just keep scrolling!”"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Slogans", "start": 0, "end": 43}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 46, "end": 151}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 155, "end": 231}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 163, "end": 176}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 211, "end": 231}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 235, "end": 245}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 358, "end": 365}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 382, "end": 568}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 382, "end": 394}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 528, "end": 568}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 571, "end": 708}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 613, "end": 619}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 796, "end": 921}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 924, "end": 1104}, {"tag": "Red_Herring", "start": 1107, "end": 1308}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1195, "end": 1223}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 1434, "end": 1599}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 2030, "end": 2141}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 2144, "end": 2284}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2224, "end": 2243}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 2287, "end": 2416}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 2419, "end": 2590}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2592, "end": 2816}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2818, "end": 2951}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2953, "end": 3058}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3118, "end": 3151}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3167, "end": 3174}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3299, "end": 3318}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 3793, "end": 3911}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3863, "end": 3870}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 3956, "end": 4106}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 4247, "end": 4334}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 4337, "end": 4512}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 4514, "end": 4621}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 4623, "end": 4790}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 4792, "end": 5053}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5055, "end": 5209}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 5357, "end": 5389}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 5432, "end": 5482}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5769, "end": 5914}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 5770, "end": 5782}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5841, "end": 5862}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6063, "end": 6355}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6447, "end": 6472}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 6475, "end": 6593}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6596, "end": 6741}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 6743, "end": 7021}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 7056, "end": 7211}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 7195, "end": 7211}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 7479, "end": 7696}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 8102, "end": 8245}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 8297, "end": 8307}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 8508, "end": 8693}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 8508, "end": 8522}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 8695, "end": 8799}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 8721, "end": 8748}], "article_id": "42117", "lang": "en", "text": "The End Of The Climate Change Hoax Is Coming: The 'Green New Deal' Is Another Step Towards Totalitarianism That Will End Up On The Trash Heap Of History \n\nYet The 'Crazy Mazies' Ignore The Facts To Blindly Push The Globalists Agenda \n\nThe “elite” that are in positions of power in our country have decided to make a final push on climate change before being debunked in the future. The man-hater from Hawaii, Mazie Hirono, stated in the past week that the Green New Deal is recognition that climate change is happening and that we should not stick our heads in the sand. She has described President Trump and his minions as knowing zero about the subject and that they deny the \"science\" behind climate change.\nSince the subject has gone from global cooling to global warming, to climate change, it proves that those who are pushing the globalist agenda are the ones who profit from instilling fear in the world population. Looking to move the globalist agenda forward through intimidation and indoctrination are being used to force the program on the people who look to the talking points with skepticism.\nGlobal warming talking points are inundating the country to the point where we now have low information liberal women telling us that they are so afraid that they can not see any reason to have children. Over the last 150 years, there has been global warming. Accepted by many scientists although the reason why is in dispute. Many climatologists and others in the climate change field agree that the climate and the global warming era we are in is regulated a great deal by the sun's activity. The solar cycles over the past 60 years have been higher than average for the 1150 year period data collection period.\nThe period of high solar activity in the 1970-1990 period is the cause of slightly rising temperatures. In the past 19 years with the decrease of solar activity, the temperatures have stabilized. The next cycles show a lack of sunspot activity called a \"solar minimum\" which will lead to cooler temperatures. Any sane climatologist must admit that solar energy input is more important than driving an SUV or pick up truck. Solar activity has been and will be more of a driving force on our climate than any globalist agenda they continue to lie to the people about.\nThey seem to think that they and they alone, by using governments to legislate the people back to the stone age can control nature. If they are so well versed on how to control the climate, why can’t they control hurricanes, or earthquakes or any other natural events that cause such damage to the Earth?\nIn 1992, Democratic Senator Tim Worth said: \"We have got to ride the global warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic policy and environmental policy.\"\nMikhail Gorbachev in 1996 : \"The threat of environmental crisis will be the international disaster key to unlock the New World Order.\"\nOur own State Department in 1992 demanded a global warming treaty even if there was no scientific evidence. Globalists have turned the global warming \"science\" into a state-sponsored corrupt religion to be used to bludgeon the world population to subjugate the community to the agenda of global governance.\nAlexandria Ocasio Cortez and the other Climate fear mongers are nothing new, it has been going on since at least the 1950s as I have written about before and will continue using false facts and bought and paid for \"scientists\" and “celebrities” like Bill Nye the Science guy who never has been a reliable source of facts. It has gone so far that Senator Sheldon Whitehouse has put forward legislation to attempt to use the RICO Act for organizations, companies and people with who disagree with the faulty science of climate change.\nThe Green New Deal, which is nothing more than a socialist wish list, rants on about the 97% consensus among scientists. This has been thoroughly debunked before. A peer reviewed study by Organizational Studies has shown that only 36% of geoscientists and engineers believe that human caused climate change is true. A strong majority of those involved in the study of over a thousand responses believe that nature is responsible for the climate changes. Even the Wall Street Journal has called the Green New Deal being based on faulty science. In the words from the Wall Street Journal: “A large and growing number of distinguished scientists and engineers do not agree that drastic action on global warming are needed.”\nGeologist Ian Palmer : “Climate change is a natural phenomenon. It has been going on for millions of years.”\nPhysicist Thomas Sheahan: “The science is NOT settled at all and it would be a great disservice to children to indoctrinate them with one currently-fashionable theory.\"\nDr. Will Happer, Princeton University Physicist and appointed to set up the Presidential Committee on Climate Change: “You should not let yourself be deceived by those who claim you are opposing “science”. Science has been badly hurt by the global warming cult.”\nUNIPCC Tom Tripp: “Despite what you may have heard in the media, there is nothing like a consensus of scientific opinion that climate change is a problem.”\n35Year Senior Research Scientist for NASA Dr.Leonard Weinstein: “Any reasonable scientific analysis must conclude that the basic theory is wrong. The Earth will always heal itself. Climate is beyond our power to control. Earth doesn't care about governments or legislation. You can find much actual global warming in present-day observations. Climate change is a matter of geologic time, something the earth routinely does on its own.”\nNobel Prize for Physics winner Dr. Robert B. Laughlin and a Research Scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory: \"The jig is up. The whole thing is a fraud. Perhaps what has doomed the Climategate fraudsters the most was their brazenness in fudging the data.”\nEven the Russians are waking up to the lies of climate change. The head of the geomagnetic laboratory of the Russian Academy of Sciences has said: \"Hundreds of billions of dollars have been wasted with the attempt of imposing an Anthropogenic Global Warming theory that is not supported by physical world evidence. AGW has been forcefully imposed by a barrage of scare stories and indoctrination that begins in elementary school textbooks.\"\nResearch Chemist William C. Gilbert: “The dysfunctional nature of the climate sciences is nothing short of a scandal. Science is too important for our society to be misused in the way it has been done within the climate science community. The global warming establishment has actively suppressed research results presented by researchers that do not comply with the dogma of the IPCC.”\nAtmospheric Physicist Dr, John Reed who has worked with Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific And Industrial Research Organization: “We maintain there is no reason whatsoever to worry about man-made climate change because there is no valid evidence that such a thing is happening.”\nClimate Statistics Professor Dr. Caleb Rossiter of American University and an Obama Liberal in every sense of the word is now being shunned by the Democrat Party for being a climate skeptic. Once his climate skepticism becomes news in a Wall Street Journal op-ed in May 2014, he was terminated from his fellowship at the liberal Institute for Policy Studies after 23 years. He called the Nobel given to Al Gore the worst Nobel Prize since Henry Kissinger. Al Gore, along with Obama vilified people who disagreed on climate change and took steps like those against Dr. Rossiter to ruin lives and assure that publications would not publish and disagreement with those in power.\nDr. Rossiter explained that Al Gore was supported by the progressive socialists in the party because they want to move away from an industrial society to a post-industrial, non-fossil fuel, post corporate society.It has been made clear that those pushing the false science of climate change from Congress to corporations will continue to maintain a zero tolerance policy in regards to climate skeptics. They will not debate nor even recognize that there may be those who read real facts concerning climate change and have a different point of view.\nSo, in an effort to ignore the facts as they are Crazy Mazie has declared that it is settled and those who are too ignorant to agree have their heads in the sand. Can you explain why these scientists mentioned above and many others do not deserve to be heard? Can you explain why those scientists that are ramming through climate change are allowed to manipulate facts and figures and put forth lies that lead to debacles like the Green New Deal? It is nothing more than a progressive socialist agenda that is one further step to the totalitarian power that the socialist demand and will be destroyed and thrown on the ash heap of history like the rest of socialism."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 69, "end": 87}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 95, "end": 405}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 566, "end": 572}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 658, "end": 684}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 717, "end": 742}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1572, "end": 1743}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1590, "end": 1619}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1746, "end": 2679}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2681, "end": 3224}], "article_id": "42119", "lang": "en", "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Responds To Trump Charges By Calling COVID-19 A Biological Weapon\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) is continuing her defense of former President Donald Trump, even after his third criminal case emerged this week that this time relates to attempts by him and his allies after the last presidential election to secure him another four years despite his documented loss to Joe Biden.\nOn Wednesday morning, she posted a lengthy statement to Twitter complaining about the new charges Trump is facing, which include allegations of conspiracy to defraud the United States. In the course of her commentary, she touched on what she called “bird killing wind turbines” and referred to COVID-19 as a “man made biological weapon,” which is not the consensus view from established authorities, though some have explored the possibility of a lab leak — which experts have noted would not necessarily mean the spread of the virus was intentional.\nGreene’s overall argument was that Americans are facing much more serious issues than those ostensibly represented by the case newly brought against Trump by Special Counsel Jack Smith at the federal Justice Department. A key component of arguments she and others ideologically aligned with her have pushed to further this idea is the contention that the southern border is “open,” which isn’t reflected in the facts. Government personnel directly involved in the handling of the border have disputed this characterization, though proposed articles of impeachment against Biden from Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) even claimed — in something totally out of touch with what’s actually being seen — that foreign criminal organizations have taken operational control of the southern border.\nGreene said, in part: “Yeah while they ALL supported violent BLM riots that destroyed $2 billion in private property in communities across America that killed people and attacked police day and night, while they violated your rights locking down our country over a man made biological weapon that was like the flu for most of the healthy population especially children, forced you to take an experimental vaccine that killed people with strokes, blood clots, myocarditis, and has left people with serious health issues, and are forcing our country and Americans pay for it all switching us to unreliable electric cars run by Chinese made toxic batteries, Chinese made bird killing wind turbines, and stop using reliable U.S. oil, gas, and clean coal bc the climate gods said we must achieve the unachievable net zero carbon – which will make electricity scarce and unaffordable for most Americans plunging us literally into darkness.”\nDemocrats consistently distanced themselves from the isolated instances of violence to which Greene refers, and she has also misrepresented the nature of data linking deaths to COVID-19 vaccines. In truth, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Systems (VAERS) provides for the broad collection of data on potentially adverse events recorded soon after a vaccine’s administration without regard to whether a meaningful connection was actually established. That comes later, and the early data to which Greene has pointed is inherently inconclusive."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 0, "end": 60}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 63, "end": 91}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 95, "end": 408}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 411, "end": 477}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 568, "end": 820}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 737, "end": 820}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 876, "end": 990}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1003, "end": 1355}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1358, "end": 1428}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1431, "end": 1617}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1620, "end": 1717}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 1724, "end": 1800}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1803, "end": 1868}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2036, "end": 2126}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2222, "end": 2329}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2229, "end": 2242}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3321, "end": 3472}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 3475, "end": 3847}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4127, "end": 4392}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 4469, "end": 4524}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 4631, "end": 4902}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5016, "end": 5040}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5122, "end": 5155}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 5212, "end": 5347}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6015, "end": 6030}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6015, "end": 6293}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6036, "end": 6051}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6296, "end": 6698}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 6701, "end": 7093}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 7016, "end": 7057}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 7200, "end": 7215}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 7539, "end": 7560}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 7620, "end": 7784}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 7893, "end": 8038}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 8041, "end": 8269}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 8457, "end": 8467}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 8615, "end": 8933}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 8936, "end": 9039}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 9323, "end": 10182}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 10598, "end": 10795}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 10798, "end": 10948}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 10923, "end": 11023}], "article_id": "4212", "lang": "en", "text": "Here's how conservatives have prolonged the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nIt didn’t have to be this way.\n\nNearly two full years after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, Americans’ lives are still being dictated by the virus.\nHundreds are still dying every day, largely the unvaccinated, whose refusal to take a life-saving medicine has turned herd immunity into a faraway fantasy.\nBut it didn’t have to be this way.\nMore lives could have been saved. Interruptions that have come to mark daily life in the 2020s could have been mitigated.\nAt every turn, conservatives — from President Donald Trump on down to local lawmakers — undermined the seriousness of the virus, politicized public health measures, and worked tirelessly to subvert guidelines that would have kept people out of hospitals.\nBelow is a running tally of the myriad ways in which Republicans have prolonged this seemingly unending pandemic, now in its third year and still overwhelming hospitals.\n\nCongress\nWithin two months of taking office, President Joe Biden managed to corral support for a historic $1.9 billion stimulus package that sent $1,400 direct-mail checks to every American, supported struggling small businesses, lowered health insurance premiums, extended unemployment benefits, and expanded tax credits designed to lift children out of poverty.\nRepublicans were united in their opposition to the American Rescue Plan.\nBut beyond their legislative intransigence, GOP senators and representatives promoted coronavirus misinformation at every turn, turning apolitical scientific facts into culture war topics.\nMembers have touted unproven drugs to their constituents, questioned the effectiveness of vaccines, and made ahistorical comparisons between public health measures and the Holocaust.\nRepublicans have also repeatedly antagonized public health leaders.\nSen. Rand Paul (R-KY) has used congressional hearings to lob falsehoods at Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Paul has accused him of being part of a team that created the virus in a Chinese laboratory.\n\nGovernors\nGovernors have served as the lead architects of their states’ COVID-19 responses. But in GOP-led states, governors have forcefully fought back against common-sense public health requirements.\nIn Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis ruled by executive order that only parents can decide whether their children wear masks in school in defiance of CDC recommendations. Virginia’s newly seated governor, Glenn Youngkin, followed suit last weekend.\nIn Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott banned private companies from mandating their employees receive the vaccine to work.\nLast summer, GOP governors also mobilized to cut off $300-a-week unemployment assistance for their residents to encourage people to get back to work, even though experts warned the move would reduce income and consumer spending while hurting workers of color.\nMonths later, DeSantis and state lawmakers in multiple other states did propose expanding unemployment benefits, but just for residents who were fired for refusing the vaccine.\nGovernors including DeSantis, Abbott, and Missouri’s Mike Parson have also pushed alternative treatments for their residents, such as expensive antibody treatments, in lieu of masking and vaccines.\nAnd they’ve flouted public health guidelines themselves, setting an example for unvaccinated residents to go out in public unmasked and spread the virus.\nIn South Dakota, Gov. Kristi Noem trumpeted her state’s Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in 2021, making a dramatic entrance on horseback and waving an American flag, despite public health experts’ warnings that an event drawing half a million people could be dangerous amid the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus.\nFollowing the event, COVID-19 cases spiked in the area.\n\nState and local lawmakers\nAcross the country, conservative state and local elected officials have banded together to strip Democratic and Republican governors of their emergency COVID-19 powers over issues like spending of federal relief money or plans to reopen the economy.\nState lawmakers have worked to curtail public health measures and ban vaccine and mask mandates. They’ve also invited vaccine skeptics and conspiracy theorists to state capitols, and have questioned vaccine effectiveness before an audience of vulnerable constituents.\nGOP Pennsylvania state Rep. Stephanie Borowicz argued the pandemic may be “punishment inflicted upon us for our presumptuous sins” and introduced a resolution in March 2020 calling for “A State Day of Humiliation, Fasting, and Prayer.”\nIdaho state Rep. Heather Scott declared, “The pandemic is over” at the start of the 2021 legislative session, and later accused the National Governors Association of being run by “globalists” after the organization released a statement with tips about virus misinformation.\n\nSheriffs\nA new movement has sprouted up among the nation’s law enforcement officers that has resulted in more anti-public health fervor across the country.\nThe Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, a right-wing anti-government group, claims membership of hundreds of sheriffs nationwide. These officers assert the power to interpret laws however they see fit, answering only to voters and not to state or federal authorities.\nAs a result, sheriffs have been meeting public health guidelines delivered from governors with staunch opposition and a refusal to enforce the rules.\nOfficers have also faced lawsuits for their treatment of people in prison throughout the pandemic.\nThe ACLU filed a lawsuit against a sheriff in Arkansas after a prison doctor treated COVID-positive patients with the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin, which research shows can cause serious harm and has not been approved for COVID-19 treatment.\nSheriffs have also been sued in California and Colorado for failing to enforce proper social distancing for people in jails, report positive cases, or administer testing.\n\nRight-wing media\nThe right-wing media, including outlets like Fox News, Newsmax, and One America News Network, have broadcast misinformation about the pandemic that’s having a strong effect on their viewers and further politicizing what began as apolitical public health guidance.\nThe misinformation began in March 2020, when Fox News first started downplaying the virus’s threat. On March 9, Fox host Sean Hannity said the virus was being used to “bludgeon Trump with this new hoax.”\nWith each new development, Fox News was there, villainizing public health leaders and their suggestions. Conservative pundits mocked masks and minimized the virus’s threat throughout the fall of 2020.\nSince COVID-19 vaccines became widely available for Americans, these outlets have continued to caution Americans against getting inoculated, despite the fact that the vaccine has been shown to be highly effective in fighting the virus in countless clinical studies.\nPolling has demonstrated just how widespread the right-wing media’s disinformation campaign has been on the American electorate.\nA December 2020 analysis conducted by three political scientists at U.S. universities found nearly that right-wing media had published almost 4,000 stories with COVID-19 misinformation between Feb. 1 and March 23, 2020.\nAnd almost 80% of Americans believe or are unsure about pandemic-related misinformation, according to a November Kaiser Family Foundation survey. Those who believed in COVID-19 conspiracy theories also noted their trust in the right-wing outlets that have promulgated them throughout the last two years.\nThe survey found that numerous respondents believed the government to be exaggerating the number of COVID-19 deaths in addition to a slate of other vaccine mistruths: that it alters your DNA, can infect you with the virus, or contains a microchip.\n\nDonald Trump\nOf course, the progenitor of COVID-19 misinformation and pandemic mismanagement is the de facto leader of the Republican Party, former President Donald Trump.\nHe frequently undermined his own public health advisers, promoted falsehoods about the virus, interfered with public health agencies, violated guidelines, and failed to take seriously a life-threatening pandemic in its early days.\nResearchers at Cornell University found that Trump’s statements questioning masks, boosting unscientific treatments, and accusing the Food and Drug Administration of being part of the “deep state” and misrepresenting testing results to be the most widespread source of pandemic misinformation at the start of the pandemic in 2020.\nThat. year, Trump insisted a vaccine was coming much sooner than scientists predicted, before the November election; blamed the media for reporting supposedly inaccurate testing totals; labeled unproven treatments as cures; and promised the virus was “going away” and that he had ended the pandemic when it was in fact still raging.\nHe also sought to interfere with public health leaders who were trying to get the pandemic under control.\nTrump; Dr. Scott Atlas, Trump’s pandemic adviser with no public health experience; and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, worked to sideline the CDC, according to emails and transcripts unveiled by a House committee investigating the administration’s pandemic mishandling.\nTrump withdrew the United States from the World Health Organization, cutting off crucial funding to the global health agency after it failed to meet his demands for promoting travel restrictions and investigating China’s role in the pandemic.\nHe also personally contradicted his own public health advisers. Trump would frequently criticize Fauci, who was the nation’s primary public health messenger at the time, and lambaste him over his recommendations to social distance and wear masks.\nTrump set a poor example for Americans by frequently violating CDC guidelines, hosting numerous rallies with unmasked attendees, meeting with advisers and guests in close proximity with no masks, and holding a Rose Garden ceremony and indoor reception for then-Supreme Court Justice nominee Amy Coney Barrett. Trump and other attendees later tested positive for COVID-19.\nFormer White House COVID-19 response coordinator Deborah Birx told the House last October that Trump very well could have saved more than 130,000 lives if he had taken heed of guidance from his public health advisers.\nA UCLA researcher set the number of casualties of Trump’s mismanagement much higher, estimating 400,000 lives could have been saved if Trump had implemented widespread testing and mask mandates.\nWith 850,000 total dead from COVID-19 in America, that means if Trump had chosen to listen to the science instead of demeaning it, he could have halved the death toll of America’s deadliest pandemic.\nInstead, with the help of conservative allies intent on demonizing public health figures and amplifying conspiracy theories, the toll continues to rise, as Americans wonder whether an end to this pandemic will ever be in sight."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 113, "end": 134}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 196, "end": 245}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 248, "end": 514}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1204, "end": 1401}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1403, "end": 1601}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1605, "end": 1791}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1804, "end": 1859}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 1862, "end": 1967}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2317, "end": 2334}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2495, "end": 2595}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 2761, "end": 2913}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2797, "end": 2855}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3011, "end": 3119}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 3161, "end": 3242}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3246, "end": 3285}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 3754, "end": 3898}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3900, "end": 3988}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4000, "end": 4007}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4276, "end": 4340}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4321, "end": 4327}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 4845, "end": 4959}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4972, "end": 4982}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 5690, "end": 5756}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6194, "end": 6225}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 6521, "end": 6580}], "article_id": "42120", "lang": "en", "text": "Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary: ‘There isn’t enough cooking oil in the world to power one day of green aviation’\n\nThe explosive airline boss with a big bonus looming sees the need for climate action – but points out ships and cars are big emitters too\n\nEven in an age of astronomical executive pay, few bosses would be indifferent to the idea of gaining another €100m. And even fewer billionaires might regularly be seen lugging their own cardboard props into the cramped lift of a London hotel before a press conference.\nBut Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary, who is in line for a payout that could dwarf anything yet seen in aviation, has long given the strong impression of not being bothered about the megabonus soon heading his way. The airline’s chief executive will receive the payout, agreed in 2019, if the company hits long-term profit targets that are looking increasingly achievable.\nThis stems partly, of course, from O’Leary being a significant investor in the airline. Given his 3.9% shareholding, the potential €98m (£84m) bonus becomes just a fraction of his spiralling on-paper wealth: a 50% rise in the shares since November already makes his stake in Ryanair several hundred million euros fatter.\nIt is possibly still not enough for O’Leary. He will concede only that aviation has made him “reasonably wealthy”. A billionaire, no? “Probably,” he says. “The Ryanair share price goes up and down.”\nBut he also appears determined to keep himself and his family grounded. At least one holiday a year is dedicated to an “educational tour”, and on this year’s agenda was a visit to concentration camps.\n“Children of people who are reasonably wealthy and have a very entitled view of the world that comes from social media – they should go and see Auschwitz and realise that bad things happen, he says. “Everyone should be aware and never forget the atrocities. No matter how hard you think your life is – go and see what happened to the Jews in the second world war.”\nIt can still come as something of a surprise to see O’Leary touch on serious subjects in public, after decades of press conference stunts, unbridled hip-shooting pronouncements and sweary tirades against those he deems incompetent.\nThis autumn, his favourite targets have been the UK’s air traffic controllers, Nats: he made repeated calls for the head of “overpaid” chief executive Martin Rolfe (salary: £477,000), after the system failure that briefly halted flights in late August. The last O’Leary press conference was an extended, full-blown denunciation of Nats, the Civil Aviation Authority and their boards of directors.\nBut once the rant is over, O’Leary is affable and entertaining, expressing opinions at pace – and if you don’t like them, he has others you might not like either.\nThe man who famously joked that the “best thing we can do with environmentalists is shoot them” says he is now concerned by the impacts of climate change. “As one of the larger farmers in Ireland, we’ve had a very bad summer this year, so yes. Look, I am generally a believer that technology and human ingenuity will overcome the concerns about climate change. I think we do have to decarbonise, and I have absolutely no doubt that we will not decarbonise because we tax people more.”\nHe’s unclear on how else that can happen. Ryanair has huge numbers of new planes on order which are more efficient per passenger, but this will mean ever more airline seats are available.\nPeople will “absolutely not” stop flying because of concerns about climate change, argues O’Leary, who was recently hit with cream pies by climate protesters in Brussels. He adds: “I always feel somewhat aggrieved that the airlines are the poster child for climate change, when airlines account for 2% of CO2 emissions. Shipping accounts for 5%, but nobody ever posts a picture of a boat chugging out of a harbour and goes: ‘There you go: the globe is warming up’.”\nBut he says sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), the great hope for many airlines, are a con: “They’re a wheeze. Unless governments get in behind the production and sourcing of sustainable aviation fuels – and they’re only going to come from, ultimately, the oil majors, the only ones who are going to make them – I don’t see where we will get the supply in the volumes we need. You want everybody running around collecting fucking cooking oil? There isn’t enough cooking oil in the world to power more than one day’s aviation.”\nRyanair has signed deals with oil majors to supply up to 9.5% of its fuel needs in SAF by 2030. “But we have no idea that they’ll be able to make those kinds of volumes.”\nTo help aviation, he says, governments should reform his bete noire: air traffic control. “If you could eliminate ATC delays and inefficient routings, you would reduce fuel consumption by another 20-25%.”\nFor O’Leary, cars should be the priority: “If you can move that to an electric fleet … It’s the only way we’re going to get anywhere close to net zero by 2050.”\nWhatever flak people direct at O’Leary’s airline, and his no-prisoners policy on additional fees, few could accuse him of being incompetent. Lowering costs, including charges from airports and suppliers, in order to keep fares low has been the bedrock of Ryanair’s phenomenal growth from Irish also-ran to Europe’s biggest airline.\nYet, he says, he fell into aviation by accident, once he eventually knuckled down after finding freedom at university: “I was at a Jesuit boarding school for six years. So we spent the first two years chasing girls and drinking beer, and then after that I wanted to go off in business and make money.”\nStarting off in KPMG as a tax accountant, he first invested in convenience stores, which was “the only way you could make money quickly in Ireland in those days. Because they were cash businesses, you kind of jacked up the turnover and extracted cash, then went and bought property with the surplus.”\nA crucial turning point came at KPMG in the 1980s when he advised one Tony Ryan, owner of an aviation leasing business, on his tax affairs and left to start working for him. Back then, the new airline “was bleeding – all the income he was getting out of the leasing company was disappearing down the black hole that was Ryanair”.\nO’Leary had been going to shut it down – but then was dispatched to the US to see Herb Kelleher, founder of Dallas-based Southwest Airlines. He returned to implement Southwest’s stripped-back model at Ryanair just as aviation across Europe was deregulating and low-cost travel was opening up. “We got there first. And managed to stay ahead of them all.”"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 0, "end": 66}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 69, "end": 215}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 219, "end": 360}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1146, "end": 1181}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1623, "end": 1881}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2326, "end": 2346}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2376, "end": 2538}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2684, "end": 2704}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2975, "end": 2983}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 3341, "end": 3481}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 3544, "end": 3586}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 3609, "end": 3796}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4476, "end": 4499}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5042, "end": 5051}], "article_id": "42121", "lang": "en", "text": "Untreated diseases could kill more than bombings in Gaza, WHO warns\n\nUntreated diseases could eventually kill more people in Gaza than bombings if the health system is not restored, the World Health Organization says.\n\nDiarrhoea and respiratory infections are widespread among children in overcrowded UN facilities where almost 1.1 million people are sheltering.\nPatients with chronic illnesses like cancer are also receiving no treatment.\nThe warning comes as a truce between Israel and Hamas entered a fifth day, after a 48-hour extension was agreed.\nThe deal mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States should see an additional 20 Israeli women and children held hostage in Gaza being released in exchange for 60 Palestinian women and teenagers in Israeli prisons.\nOn Monday, 11 hostages and 33 prisoners were freed on the fourth and final day of the initial agreement, bringing the totals to 50 hostages and 150 prisoners released.\nNineteen foreign nationals, one of whom has Israeli citizenship, have also been handed over by Hamas under separate agreements.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza and imposed a siege in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage.\nGaza's Hamas-run government says more than 14,800 people have been killed in the territory since the war began.\nThe UN estimates that more than 1.8 million people in Gaza have fled their homes over the past seven weeks. About 60% of them are sheltering in 156 facilities belonging to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa.\nWHO spokeswoman Dr Margaret Harris told a news conference in Geneva that an assessment of those shelters had found outbreaks of infectious diseases, with cases of diarrhoea among children aged five and older more than 100 times normal levels by early November.\nNo treatment is available for them, she said, without which infants in particular can deteriorate and die very quickly.\nAccording to the UN, only five hospitals are partially operational in the north of Gaza, the area that has been the focus of the Israeli ground offensive.\nEight of the 11 hospitals are functional in the south, where the Israeli military has ordered civilians to flee. Only one of those hospitals has the capacity to treat critical trauma cases or perform complex surgery.\n\"Eventually, we will see more people dying from disease than we are even seeing from the bombardment if we are not able to put back [together] this health system,\" Dr Harris warned.\nAddressing journalists via video link from Gaza, Unicef spokesman James Elder reported seeing hospitals full of children with horrendous war wounds.\nHe described seeing one child missing part of his leg lying untreated on a hospital floor for several hours because of a lack of medical staff. Other injured children were lying in car parks and gardens outside, he said.\nDisplaced children and their families are also suffering because of a lack of proper shelter and clothing to protect them from the rainy and cold weather currently in Gaza.\nOver the first four days of the truce, 800 aid lorries entered Gaza, with some reaching the north, according to US officials. That is an increase in comparison to the preceding few days, but it is still just a fraction of the usual number.\nThe UN agencies say that in such conditions, a resumption in fighting should be unthinkable, they are calling again for a permanent ceasefire.\nIsrael's prime minister has promised that its military will \"go to realising our goals with full force\" when the pause ends.\nHowever, Qatar's foreign ministry said on Tuesday that it would use the extension to seek a \"sustainable truce that would lead to further negotiations and eventually an end... to this war\".\n\"We are working with what we have. And what we have right now is the provision to the agreement that allows us to extend days as long as Hamas is able to guarantee the release of at least 10 hostages,\" spokesman Majed al-Ansari told reporters in Doha.\nHe added that mediators hoped to receive information from Hamas about the more than 150 Israelis and foreign nationals still being held hostage, who include children as young as 10 months old as well as a number of soldiers.\nA senior Hamas source in Qatar told the BBC that not all of the civilian hostages were in its hands. Some were with smaller armed groups like Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which like Hamas is classed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other Western powers.\nAccording to the source, Hamas needs more time to collect information and contact people.

It’s literally insane!\nAs Time Magazine predicted all the way back in 1977, the real data show that the world is actually cooling, and we are rapidly headed into a new ice age. Hear anything about that these days in the woke mainstream media? No, of course not. The media are shills for the billionaire elites and the #ClimateHoax.\nSo let’s take a few minutes to go over the real facts of the “climate crisis” in 2023.\n\n“The Ice Caps are Melting”\nBullshit.

The climate hoaxers are asking us to deny the evidence of our very own eyes!\n[Line chart showing the mean sea level value across the years, source cited]\nThe fact is that the rapid cooling of the planet has caused sea level to drop as glaciers expand.\nWhat we should be worried about are impacts that sea level drop will have on tourism, not fake beach erosion and imaginary flooding.\n\n“It’s Getting Hotter”\nBy now it should be pretty obvious that if the poles are colder, glaciers and sea ice are expanding, sea levels are dropping, and sea temperatures are dropping… that it’s not getting hotter.\nThis is the biggest climate scam of all.\nWalk outside. I dare you. Is it hot or cold? It’s cold, right?\nThat’s because it’s called winter, and winter is cold. Duh. Climate scammers think we’re all idiots!\nBut the truth is that it’s the climate hoaxers who are idiots.\n[Infographics showing montly and yearly air temperature anomalies]\nEven the Japanese know it’s a scam!

Zack, I know I picked on you a lot, but you have some of the best climate graphics out there!\n\nA Final Word\nI honestly think that if what is satirically portrayed in this story were actually happening (i.e., we were entering an ice age at this insanely rapid rate), the entire world would be frantically trying to do something about it.\nBut the fossil fuel companies have done their work so well that a large part of the populus — and most of the rich and powerful — refuse to even listen.\nThey are the ones living in upside down world."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 0, "end": 63}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 66, "end": 240}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 153, "end": 159}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 224, "end": 240}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 243, "end": 469}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 477, "end": 486}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 553, "end": 664}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 553, "end": 560}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 849, "end": 907}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1107, "end": 1327}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1330, "end": 1527}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1656, "end": 1813}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1898, "end": 1953}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 1955, "end": 2094}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 2191, "end": 2358}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2444, "end": 2468}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2542, "end": 2567}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2570, "end": 2689}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 2839, "end": 2922}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2886, "end": 2907}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2925, "end": 2957}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2995, "end": 3136}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3138, "end": 3286}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3247, "end": 3286}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3333, "end": 3353}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3564, "end": 3597}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3603, "end": 3640}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 3643, "end": 3769}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3864, "end": 3938}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 3941, "end": 4124}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 4127, "end": 4162}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4165, "end": 4240}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4348, "end": 4477}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 4480, "end": 4632}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4749, "end": 4918}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4753, "end": 4774}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4921, "end": 5033}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5044, "end": 5088}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 5168, "end": 5551}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 5609, "end": 5666}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 5669, "end": 6002}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5909, "end": 5925}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6005, "end": 6228}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6094, "end": 6116}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6119, "end": 6130}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6405, "end": 6423}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 6427, "end": 6542}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6476, "end": 6495}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6780, "end": 6929}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 7346, "end": 7560}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 7453, "end": 7476}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 7695, "end": 7984}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 7755, "end": 7777}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 7987, "end": 8235}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 8280, "end": 8413}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 8551, "end": 8595}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 8615, "end": 8867}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 8871, "end": 8938}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 8941, "end": 9067}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 9369, "end": 9379}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 9748, "end": 9879}], "article_id": "42124", "lang": "en", "text": "Infanticide Will Be The Law Of The Land If Democrats Win In 2020: EVERY Democratic Presidential Candidate Reveal Themselves As Demons Who Approve Of The Murders Of America's Most Innocent \n\nEvery Single One Of Them Is Doing The Work Of Satan\n\n\"Roe v Wade was an errant ruling by the Supreme Court, and one that has rightfully earned Public opposition because the Court ventured too far in the change it ordered. And presented an incomplete justification for its action.”\nThose utterances will be condemned as taking reproductive rights away from women. Leftists will tell you that whoever spoke those words should be run out of town after being tarred and feathered. It is interesting to see the reaction from the progressive socialists and rabid feminists when they are told those words were uttered by none other than Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1985. Even MSNBC knew that Roe v Wade stands on a weak foundation. Destroying the states rights to compromise the outcome of the citizens on abortion, what Roe v Wade has done is force a no-compromise ruling on the states and silenced any opposition until lately.\nIt is based on a woman’s right to privacy not found in the Constitution but was the premise to override a states legislative choice. The choice of the individual states is based on the wishes of the citizens of that state. The Supreme Court used arguments not enumerated in the Constitution to allow progressive socialist to inflict on the people of this country a “constitutional right” that does not exist and never has. It isn’t even legally flimsy but has no basis in the founding documents without the beleaguered opinion of the Supreme Court. For abortion to be codified, it may be by the passage of an Amendment and not by the views of the Justices who have convictions about the morality of abortion.\nIt is ridiculous that abortion is framed in the mantle of “reproductive justice.” The question that needs to be asked is justice for whom? Ignoring the civil and human right of an unborn child is not the foundation of our country and the religious tenets that founded our nations. Neither is the indoctrination of our children by elected officials on the virtue of abortion.\nOr take the case of Dr. Warren Hern an abortionist that MSNBC had on to declare that those against abortion are terrorists going so far as comparing them to the Taliban. Both he and the correspondent went further to accuse anti-abortionists as creating violence and intimidation and of being mindless fanatics.\nThey ignore people like Kermit Gosnell, a fanatic in his own right, and in states like Pennsylvania, refuse even to consider primary medical care to be available at the site of an abortion. The Pennsylvania law would allow for no bans, eradicating a “heartbeat bill” that has passed in Pennsylvania and allowing partial birth abortions. Infanticide will be the law of the land if the progressive socialists have their way.\nProgressive socialist politicians also feel the need to get involved. Pete Buttigieg even went so far as to inform Christians that abortion law was based on the Christian teaching of helping “the least among us.” Christians understand what the mention of those words in the Bible really means, and it does not include the tearing of a baby from its mother’s womb. But once again, bastardizing the Bible to a progressive socialist is fine as long as it meets the agenda they have chosen.\nWhen Da Nang Dick Blumenthal was asked if abortions should be allowed for healthy babies in healthy mothers, he refused to answer. It is similar across the progressive socialist spectrum and the harridans of the feminist movement. When asked about the aspects of late-term abortion, they either change the subject or speak once again on “reproductive right.” I want to ask them if abortion should be continually used as a form of birth control because some woman could not keep her legs together or find effective birth control.\nThen there is Presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand, when asked why taxpayer funds should be used for abortion said It’s not your ( the citizens) decision whether to fund abortions. The government should fund abortions. I guess Gillibrand has forgotten who the government is and who she works for. She is also for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, passed to stop taxpayer funds being used for abortion. She considers abortion “reproductive care” a phrase always used by the progressive socialists which is a lie just in the statement. What about the reproductive care of the unborn child? Why is this a “right” when owning a gun will not be if the progressive socialist should gain power?\nEven Joe Biden has flipped on abortion leaving a position against Roe v Wade rather than stand for his principles. And a tyrant in the making, Kamala Harris has determined that any abortion laws passed by the states must be approved through the federal government Department of Justice. She seems to think killing an unborn child is a civil right, but refuses to discuss the civil rights of the child.\nAll the presidential progressive socialist candidates have spoken of no limitation to abortion as a fundamental right of the woman. They don’t seem to understand that 75% of Americans, including 61% of those who identify as “pro-choice” agree that abortion should be limited to the first three months, a tenet of the Roe v Wade decision. All the Presidential candidates on the progressives socialist wing of the Democrat Party and all Democrats have voted against the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Act numerous times. Approaching 50 by the last count, the pro-choice party refuses to even let a viable baby outside the womb to live.\nAnne Hathaway, who is nothing more than an actress explicitly stated that the Alabama lawmakers who she claims are men restrict abortions to be complicit in the death of black women. Ignoring the fact that Planned Parenthood was founded by a racist eugenist, how can she blame men for a law instigated and signed into law by two women. State Representative Katrina Jackson for Louisiana spoke of Planned Parenthood declaring Pro-life crisis centers “fake clinics.” I suppose any clinic that doesn’t provide what is quickly becoming infanticide is a fake clinic. California attempted to pass laws that would force Pregnancy Crisis Centers into abortion referral centers.\nKatrina Jackson also condemned the aborting of black babies as a “modern-day genocide.” It has now been shown that more black babies are murdered by abortion than by violence disease and sickness combined. Rep. Jackson has been at the forefront of using social justice as a way to curb abortions. She speaks of advocacy for post birth resources being made available for those who decline abortion with particular emphasis on needy families. The progressive socialists and even some of the Presidential candidates have spoken of no help being provided by pro-life groups after a child is born.\nNothing is farther from the truth. One such group is the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA). Assistance from pro life groups on a local level is everywhere, from church groups to small organizations and individuals. They also provide over $100 million to pro-life Pregnancy Crisis Centers that have developed in most areas to finding housing and food for those who decide to have their child. I have seen many stories about Planned Parenthood workers, up to and including managers leaving because of the despicable practices that happen there. How many have left Pregnancy Crisis Centers for the same reason? The women that I know that work in those centers are caring and always look forward to helping to make life better for all they can.\nKristen Day, the director of Democrats for Life of America, a robust pro-life group has shown that one-third of Democrats oppose abortion but dare not say that because they would then be set upon by the radical leftists that demand everyone speak with one voice even though you may disagree.\nDoes Planned Parenthood care about their patients? Do they make a point to supply psychiatric assistance to combat depression, or do they allow them to just leave and go back to the same situation that caused them to get pregnant in the first place?\nThe language of abortion has also changed. To hide the reality of what abortion is the media in coordination with Planned Parenthood has changed the words used in the discussion. It has been such a large part of obfuscating what the reality is that NPR has put out talking points of what phrases and terms to use. Even the “pro-choice” moniker is a false flag. Choice for whom? Certainly not the innocent child. Pro-life is now a term not to be used on NPR. The reason for that is readily apparent. What about partial-birth abortion, or late-term abortion? They have been replaced with the clinical “intact dilation and extraction\" — a sterile reflection of ripping a viable baby from the mother’s womb. Of course, the words “baby” and “unborn” can no longer be used. They come too close to giving the baby the humanity it deserves. It shows the intense bias of NPR and other media that they can not speak in terms of humanity with any objectivity. Not stated by NPR is that in New York City alone the number of late-term abortions was 1,485 in 2015, while there were only 352 victims of murder.\nSo now, the country finds itself in a moral war over the rights of the unborn. Many states are passing infanticide bills, and in the case of Illinois allows full-term abortion in non-inspected clinics by non-doctors and no reporting requirements. Many states have attempted to force insurance companies to cover abortions and also to force a religious organization to cover abortions against the beliefs they hold.\nAnd as pertains to Hollywood, they are more worried about the treatment of chickens at McDonalds than they are about unborn children."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 0, "end": 45}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 167, "end": 316}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 274, "end": 290}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 319, "end": 398}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 401, "end": 475}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 828, "end": 1088}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1495, "end": 1555}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1592, "end": 1738}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1827, "end": 2082}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2085, "end": 2353}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2355, "end": 2694}], "article_id": "42126", "lang": "en", "text": "Ukrainian leadership is delusional – historian\n\nPresident Vladimir Zelensky apparently believes that inflicting a defeat on Russia is possible, Tarik Cyril Amar says\n\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine would have never happened without the interference of the West and its “insane” idea of an ever-expanding NATO, Tarik Cyril Amar, an associate professor at Koc University in Istanbul, believes.\nSpeaking to RT’s Oksana Boyko on Worlds Apart, the history professor shared his thoughts on the insistence of both Kiev and its Western backers on inflicting a decisive battlefield defeat on Russia – which seemingly remains unchanged despite all the setbacks the Ukrainian military has suffered. For Kiev, such a belief might actually be genuine, he suggested.\n“Regarding the Ukrainian leadership, I would not be able to tell. I have a guess that President Zelensky himself is, basically, delusional and has become drunk on his own rhetoric as well as the flattery that he used to receive from the West. I think it has really deranged him a bit and disturbed his relationship to reality,” the RT.com contributor suggested.\nIn the West, the understanding that such a goal is not viable has become more prominent, and talk of continuous support for Ukraine is, at least partially, a “negotiation tactic,” the professor argued.\n“Concerning the West, my guess is that quite a few people in Washington and in the EU as well understand that they have to get out of this war without a Russian defeat. Now do they understand already how much they have to concede? Again, I can’t tell,” Amar stated.\nWestern decision makers, particularly in the US, apparently still “live in the 1990s” and refuse to realize that the age of “unilateralism” is over. The Russian leadership, as well as China and Iran, live in the present, Amar claimed.\nWithout Western interference, the conflict between Kiev and Moscow would have never started, and multiple opportunities to bring it to an end were deliberately sabotaged, including the Minsk agreement of 2015 and the Istanbul talks of March 2022, Amar said.\n“The roots of the war do really go to 2008, the infamous Bucharest summit, when both Georgia and Ukraine were put by the West into this insane position of saying’ One day you’ll be in NATO, but not now,’ which, of course, exposed them and made them threats for Russia.”\nThe West’s insistence on fueling the conflict largely stems from two ideas, Amar explained. The West “simply won’t give up on its idea of expanding NATO, which in itself is an insane idea,” as well as pursues a “long-term geopolitical strategy of getting Russia down,” as it refused to accept Moscow’s resurgence following the 1990s turmoil."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 376, "end": 387}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 480, "end": 485}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 813, "end": 973}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 896, "end": 905}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1021, "end": 1056}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1059, "end": 1106}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1808, "end": 1899}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1865, "end": 1881}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2606, "end": 2617}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2772, "end": 2777}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2795, "end": 2821}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2914, "end": 2920}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3107, "end": 3115}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 3139, "end": 3171}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3151, "end": 3171}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 3334, "end": 3400}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3451, "end": 3470}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 3548, "end": 3551}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3559, "end": 3564}], "article_id": "42127", "lang": "en", "text": "Israeli survivor makes emotional return to scene of Hamas attack\n\nTears welled in May Hayat's eyes as she stood in silence on an emotional return to the site of an Israeli music festival where she narrowly escaped death in a Hamas attack a month ago.\nHayat, 30, was working as a bartender at the open-air Nova music festival a few kilometres from the Gaza security fence when Hamas gunmen attacked on Oct. 7, killing 260 festival-goers and taking others hostage.\nShe survived her ordeal by hiding under a stage, smearing a victim's blood on her face and pretending to be dead.\nHayat returned to the venue near Kibbutz Re'im in southern Israel for the first time on Monday, hoping it would help her come to terms with her trauma and unlock the tears that she says have flowed properly only once in the past month.\n\"If you think they (Hamas) are an organization acting in self-defence..., they are terrorists, they want us dead, they can’t justify any of this, they don’t care,\" Hayat, who lives in Tel Aviv, told Reuters.\n\"They also killed Arab Israelis here, everyone who lives in Israel is a target to kill,\" she said.\nWarning that \"they will eventually reach other countries,\" she added: \"I hope you will wake up before it comes to you.\"\nHayat is one of many Israelis struggling to come to terms with the events of Oct. 7 that triggered an Israeli military campaign to wipe out Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement that rules the Gaza Strip.\nSome 1,400 Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed in attacks by Hamas militants on Oct. 7 and more than 200 were abducted, according to Israeli tallies.\nSince then, Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed more than 10,000 people, around 40% of them children, according to tallies by health officials there.\n\nESCAPE\nOn the day of the attack on the music festival, the gunmen left their victims where they killed them and debris was strewn across the ground.

Climate Change Conference in Paris. Yes, the very conference in which the Paris climate accords were negotiated.\nAlso of interest: Shortly after Francis’ climate change opus was released, several so-called experts associated with international organizations dedicated to combating climate change came out and praised him, because, of course, the pope is a climate science expert.\nHere are a couple of their responses.\nAchim Steiner, then-executive director of the U.N. Environment Program: The United Nations “welcomes Pope Francis’ unambiguous call to action in the face of global environmental degradation and climate change. This encyclical is a clarion call that resonates not only with Catholics, but with all of the Earth’s peoples. Science and religion are aligned on this matter: The time to act is now.”\nThen-U.N. Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres: “Pope Francis’ encyclical underscores the moral imperative for urgent action on climate change to lift the planet’s most vulnerable populations, protect development, and spur responsible growth. This clarion call should guide the world towards a strong and durable universal climate agreement in Paris at the end of this year. Coupled with the economic imperative, the moral imperative leaves no doubt that we must act on climate change now.”\nGee, I wonder if the United Nations and other global institutions devoted to peddling the falsehood that climate change is an existential threat are aware of the irony involved with mingling religion and science.\nOnce upon a time, the Catholic Church persecuted Galileo for insisting that the Earth revolves around the sun. The Catholic Church also instituted the Inquisition. When it comes to science, the Catholic Church does not have the best track record.\nBut this has not stopped the current leader of the Catholic Church, which has 1.2 billion members, from engaging in the climate change debate, despite his utter foolishness on the topic.\nIn his most recent attempt to cement his climate change bona fides, Pope Francis released an apostolic exhortation titled “To All People of Good Will on the Climate Crisis,” in which he states: “Despite all attempts to deny, conceal, gloss over or relativize the issue, the signs of climate change are here and increasingly evident. No one can ignore the fact that in recent years we have witnessed extreme weather phenomena, frequent periods of unusual heat, drought and other cries of protest on the part of the earth that are only a few palpable expressions of a silent disease that affects everyone.”\nHe also proclaims that “the world in which we live is collapsing and may be nearing the breaking point” and “the necessary transition towards clean energy sources such as wind and solar energy, and the abandonment of fossil fuels, is not progressing at the necessary speed.”\nWhat’s more, he lamented “the irresponsible lifestyle connected with the Western model,” and singled out the United States for being the worst emitter of carbon dioxide while giving China a pass.\nIn reality, as we climate realists well know, the idea that climate change represents an existential threat to our existence is downright absurd. For millions of years, the climate has changed. As the record shows, there have been fluctuations in the Earth’s temperature going back billions of years, way before humans harnessed the ability to use fossil fossils to generate power.\nMoreover, while Francis chides the “Western lifestyle,” he conveniently ignores that Western society, the advent of fossil fuels, and free-market capitalism have lifted billions from poverty while inventing technologies and developing medical breakthroughs that have made the entire world better off. And is Francis unaware or simply overlooking the fact that the United States has reduced its carbon dioxide emissions substantially over the past 30 years while countries like China and Russia have increased theirs?\nPut simply, Pope Francis is wrong regarding all things concerning climate change. Still, I can’t help but wonder if he is being used as a pawn by those who benefit from touting the climate change lie, seeing as how he is the leader of one of the world’s most influential religious institutions.\nMaybe climate change and religion, which are both based on belief, have more in common than we thought."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 0, "end": 127}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 186, "end": 236}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 238, "end": 349}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 246, "end": 262}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 352, "end": 579}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 709, "end": 884}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1106, "end": 1177}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 1648, "end": 1874}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2359, "end": 2606}], "article_id": "4213", "lang": "en", "text": "Highly mutated COVID variant ‘Pirola’ JN.1 is spawning.

hospitalizations, and deaths to the worldwide well being group, and since testing continues to take a seat at all-time lows.\nThe knowledge comes from solely 1 / 4 of the world’s nations—lower than 50

acceptable,” he mentioned.\n\n‘Pirola’ JN.1 spawn start their ascent\nThe global traits mirror these in the U.S., the place COVID deaths had been up 12.5% week-over-week and hospitalizations had been up greater than 20% as of Dec. 30, in line with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nIn the U.S., too, JN.1 dominates, comprising an estimated 62% of instances in the U.S. as of Jan. 6, in line with CDC projections.\nAnd its spawn are already climbing the charts, in line with Raj Rajnarayanan—assistant dean of analysis and affiliate professor at the New York Institute of Technology campus in Jonesboro, Ark., and a high COVID variant tracker.\nJN.1.4—a “child” variant, so to talk, of JN.1—was the No. 3 mostly reported variant in the U.S. on Thursday, comprising 11.5% of sequences, in line with Rajnarayanan, utilizing knowledge from GISAID, a global analysis group that tracks modifications in COVID and the flu virus.\nIt’s chargeable for 11% of sequences globally, he added.\nOther Pirola spawn topping U.S. variants included JN.1.1, which comprised 6% of sequences, and JN.1.2, which comprised a bit over 1% of sequences.\n“Pirola” JN.1 could also be the starting of a brand new chapter in the pandemic, some consultants say, with all dominant variants for the foreseeable future evolving from it and choosing up further mutations that would both assist or hurt the virus.\nAlready, JN.1.4 accommodates a mutation, Spike R346T, that would make it much more immune evasive—one contained in some earlier mutations like BA.2.75.2, BA.4.6, BQ.1.1, and XBB.1."},

Been Far More People Fighting Covid Tyranny Than We Thought, but Their Voices Are Only Just Now Being Heard\n\nFor four years, we’ve carried around a presumption that when lockdowns came, most people went along out of fear of the virus. Or maybe people were just intimidated by the propaganda, which was overwhelming. Then the “mass formation” (madness of crowds) kicked in and tossed out their wits in favor of following the myth to absurd extents.\nThat’s a conventional version of what happened.\nAnd yet, we keep hearing of early voices of dissent at the time that didn’t get a hearing.\nThe problem of figuring out whether and to what extent people acquiesced to tyranny is an important one. It is complicated by accumulating evidence that the government worked with tech and media, and therefore with the main way people get their news, to actively suppress contrary voices, even when they came from recognized experts of great credibility.\nDid you see the movie The Big Short? It is based on a book by Michael Lewis. Both celebrate short-selling contrarian Michael Burry of Scion Capital. Back in 2006, he began to see strange features of the housing bubble. These financial products called mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) packed highly-rated mortgage bonds with terribly-rated ones. The more he looked, the more he was convinced that a massive housing bust was on the way.\nHe shorted the market, even going to the point of pushing various financial firms to create funds that did just that even when they didn’t previously exist. Very few believed there was a bubble in housing because all the experts, including the head of the central bank, said otherwise. The whole system was propping up a fake market.\nBurry, who is a trained physician, believed it was going to fail. He had looked at the details instead of trusting the experts. And he turned out to be correct, perhaps early but correct eventually. The movie and book present him as a hero for being willing to go against the crowd and the experts both.\nThe lesson: we should all be more like Burry. Even since the telling of this story, he has been valorized as a person of great wisdom. Never trust the experts, the system, the conventional wisdom, the madness of crowds. Do your own research like Burry did!\nWhen the lockdowns began in March 2020, it turns out that Dr. Burry joined Twitter solely for the purpose of denouncing what was going on. He sent emails too, to Bloomberg. Burry wrote them right away:\nStay-at-home policies need not be universal. COVID-19 is a disease that is somewhat lethal for the obese, the very old, the already-sick. Public policies have no nuance because they want to maximize fear to enforce compliance. But universal stay-at-home policies devastate small and medium sized business and indirectly beat up women and children, kill and create drug addicts, engender suicides, and in general create tremendous misery and mental anguish. These secondary and tertiary effects are getting no play in the prevailing narratives.\nAmong his statements on Twitter:\nAmericans must not abide. Government restrictions are doing orders of magnitude more damage to the lives of Americans than COVID could ever have done on its own.\nRoughly 2.8 million people die in the US each year. The worst estimates for COVID would add less than 10% to that total. Consider this as the media implies Americans are dying at multiples of normal rates. Compassion is not incompatible with facts.\nUnconscionable. Let’s put today’s horrific jobless claims in perspective. This is not the virus. This is the response to the virus killing the US and global economy, with all accompanying human tragedy. I present America’s initial jobless claims over the decades.\n15 million mortgage defaults? An unemployment rate exceeding 10%? Social unrest can be expected as it passes 20%. Unthinkable in America. Just two months ago the economy was great. A virus shows up that kills less than 0.2%, and the government does THIS?\nCOVID like all coronaviruses will not easily engender durable herd immunity, and vaccines will prove elusive. We must learn to live with it – which means universal treatment with available drugs and no hysteria, i.e. NO LOCKDOWN!\nHe later took down the tweets and deleted his accounts, maybe out of despair of making any difference. We don’t know. Nor do we know how many retweets or likes he received or what the comments were, simply because they are no longer there. (If anyone can figure out how to find this, please let me know; I’ve checked every outlet.)\nGiven Burry’s status as a genuine contrarian expert, in the midst of a grotesque policy without precedent, you might have thought that the media would be all over him. He would be on all the talk shows. Experts would address his claims, refuting them or backing them.\nWhat happened instead was: nothing.\nIn those days, I was desperate to find voices of disagreement. I really could not find any. I felt very alone. So too, as it turns out, did many others. There were many of us, as it turns out. We just couldn’t find each other. Or maybe certain algorithms were in place that prevented us from finding each other.\nThere seemed to be this strange trend alive at the time. The recognized experts of the past were all swept away. Many had their accounts deleted. They were replaced by new experts about whom we knew almost nothing or who had severely compromised reputations, like Anthony Fauci.\nAn example is Devi Sridhar, who advised the Scottish government. More than anyone else, she was granted astonishing amounts of airtime throughout the UK. She was a proponent of the idea of “Zero Covid” through lockdowns and, later, vaccines. She now admits that this was an error, that we do indeed need to live with the virus. But her book from that period she still promotes on all her social media accounts.\nDid they have any track records we could check? How do we know these people are real experts? These were questions hardly anyone asked.\nHow is it that Sridhar was the go-to expert whereas other experts were throttled, blocked, denounced, canceled, and deleted? Perhaps because she worked for the Gates Foundation? It’s impossible not to become a conspiracy theorist to some extent as you look at this situation.\nThere is no reason to go all the way to October with the experts who wrote the Great Barrington Declaration. They faced extreme attacks. But really the attempts to curate the public mind and engineer a consensus began as soon as the lockdowns took effect.\nThe same agency that meddled so heavily in information curation was also the agency that broke up the workforce between essential and nonessential, and later on dismissed the risks of absentee ballots even though their internal memos reveal vast awareness. That would be the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency or CISA. Created in 2018 and practically invisible to most Americans, this small agency exercised enormous power over what we knew and what we heard.\nMeanwhile, we’ve been hearing about many dissidents who were trying to speak out early on and could not get a hearing, many of whom now write for Brownstone.\nThink how different 2008 would have been with the same level of speech control. Markets would not have corrected toward reality so quickly. It’s one thing for a truth to be unpopular or unconventional; it’s something else to be actively suppressed.\nLooking back, one really does wonder what the reality was in those early days after lockdown. No question that mass formation played a huge role. No question that people gave in and complied far more than they should have. But what if government had not been collaborating with tech and media and just allowed the free flow of information? Might the lockdowns have ended much sooner simply because people could have heard a different point of view?\nWe’ll never know. This does serve as a cautionary note against a wholesale condemnation of the world for failing to stand up to tyranny. Maybe many people did stand up, in whatever limited way they could, but simply faced a system that prevented them from getting a hearing."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 0, "end": 33}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 36, "end": 368}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 396, "end": 490}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 797, "end": 1228}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 856, "end": 885}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1458, "end": 1473}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1504, "end": 1642}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1660, "end": 1679}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 2369, "end": 2594}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2946, "end": 2994}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 2997, "end": 3201}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3281, "end": 3549}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 3932, "end": 4028}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 4037, "end": 4083}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 4229, "end": 4285}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4534, "end": 4890}], "article_id": "42133", "lang": "en", "text": "How abortion hypocrisy kills women\n\nOpposition to abortion is so intense that even where women have the legal right to terminate their pregnancy, it can be extremely difficult to access the services needed to exercise that right. But, worse than that, opponents of abortion tend to ignore the failures that lead women to the point where they seek one in the first place.\nFrom a moral standpoint, there is a strong case to be made for respecting a woman’s personal freedom and bodily autonomy, rather than forcing her to put her health or well-being at risk by carrying an unwanted or unsafe pregnancy to term. Yet, given how rife with misinformation and muddied by misplaced arguments the issue is, policy debates often go nowhere unless they frame abortion first and foremost as a health matter.\nConsider the case of Kenya. Despite having one of Africa’s most progressive abortion laws, a woman has the right to terminate a pregnancy if “there is need for emergency treatment, or the life or health of the mother is in danger, or if permitted by any other written law”, enduring opposition to abortion has undermined implementation. And this is to say nothing of the women who would not qualify for an abortion under these rules.\nBut it is well documented that outlawing abortion does not end the practice. Rather, when the authorities jail anyone who is rumored to be providing safe abortions, as occurs in Kenya, women end up turning to providers who use highly dangerous methods to get the job done. For example, they perforate women’s uteruses with sharp objects, sit on women’s bellies to eject the fetus and prescribe unsafe concoctions.\nTo avoid these back-alley providers, women try to induce abortions by ingesting large amounts of painkillers or poisoning themselves with detergents. Some die; others are left with no uterus; still others are left managing complications like cervicovaginal fistulas.\nAfter years working in reproductive health, I can say authoritatively that women do not terminate pregnancies on a whim. They do not pay an unqualified person to stab their uterus because the mood strikes them. Condemning them will not change their minds; nor will prioritising the development of a fetus over the needs, rights and well-being of its mother. All it will do is make them more likely to risk their health and lives seeking an unsafe abortion.\nIf we want to reduce demand for abortion services, we must recognise that it is often the culmination of a series of systemic failures that begin during childhood, when a comprehensive sexual education (CSE) should be required. A CSE teaches young people about sex and relationships in an age-appropriate, culturally sensitive, realistic, non-judgmental and scientifically accurate way, and can increase the use of contraceptives and reduce teen pregnancy rates, particularly if it takes a gender-based approach, focusing on empowering young girls to protect their own health.\nSuch an education is not a privilege, but a right. In Kenya, Article 35 of the constitution guarantees every citizen “the right of access to information held by another person and required for the exercise or protection of any right or fundamental freedom”. This includes the right to reproductive healthcare, enshrined in Article 43.\nBut, like the right to abortion, the right to CSE is often not respected, owing to moralising resistance from religious leaders and anti-choice movements, as well as other factors, such as weak dissemination of the curriculum and a dearth of adequately trained teachers. As a result, myths and misconceptions remain widespread.\nThis, together with funding shortages and cultural factors, such as a lack of male involvement in reproductive-health issues, contribute to low contraceptive uptake, with only 58 per cent of women in Kenya who should be using modern contraceptives actually doing so. Unsurprisingly, teenage pregnancy is unacceptably high.\nIt is time to address the systemic failures that lead to girls and women ending up maimed or dead. Here, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure: contraception in health budgets, quality CSE in schools, and youth-friendly reproductive-health services.\nBut the cure must also be an option. Rules that punish women must be replaced with modern laws, in line with international human-rights frameworks, that protect women’s reproductive freedom, including by guaranteeing access to safe abortion services. Written guidelines to end the victimisation of abortion service providers are also needed.\nHow can a government that fails to ensure CSE or invest adequately in family planning penalise its women for unwanted pregnancies? How can a society that ignores women’s suffering blame the victims for its inaction? Those who do nothing to prevent unwanted pregnancies, and everything to punish the women affected by them, cannot claim the moral high ground."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 0, "end": 57}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 60, "end": 258}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 441, "end": 709}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 712, "end": 1267}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1531, "end": 1995}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1885, "end": 2544}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2162, "end": 2188}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2206, "end": 2232}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2271, "end": 2297}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2614, "end": 2641}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2644, "end": 3093}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 3401, "end": 3427}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 3508, "end": 4206}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 4209, "end": 4238}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 4241, "end": 4391}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4296, "end": 4303}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 4764, "end": 4997}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5369, "end": 5392}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 5591, "end": 5637}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5674, "end": 5754}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 6451, "end": 6806}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 6720, "end": 6806}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6809, "end": 7697}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 7909, "end": 8005}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 8095, "end": 8212}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 8366, "end": 8660}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 8404, "end": 8420}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 8968, "end": 9102}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 9057, "end": 9081}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 9260, "end": 9670}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 9722, "end": 9774}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 9777, "end": 10295}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 10678, "end": 10897}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 10949, "end": 11725}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 11010, "end": 11020}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 11042, "end": 11052}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 11086, "end": 11092}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 11211, "end": 11217}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 11728, "end": 12038}], "article_id": "42136", "lang": "en", "text": "Indifference To COVID Is Indifference To The Value Of Life\n\nLife is a precious gift to be honored and preserved. This does not mean we should artificially preserve life indefinitely, hooked up on a machine, never allowing a person to go to their natural death. When we do that, what they have is not true life, but its shadow, and with it, the person has lost most if not all the dignity which should be associated with life in the process. On the other hand, we should not be indifferent to the plight of others. We should do what we can to protect and preserve the life of others, but we must do so in a way which does not undermine the value of life itself. This is why health care should be seen as a right. Needless to say, so many of those who claim to support life, so many who claim all life is precious, show through their actions how little they believe their own words. While they speak loudly about matters which do not concern them or place any expectations or burdens upon themselves, when they are expected to do something, they often make the loudest noise against doing what is necessary. Even if it is minor action expected of them, they will find every excuse they can to dismiss their obligation, proving that their words about life are meaningless. Indeed, they, like Cain, end up asking, “Am I my brother’s keeper?” (Gen. 4:9b RSV). We have seen this with COVID, where so many not only fought against actions which were necessary to limit its spread and harm to society, they continue that fight to this day. They show a grave indifference to life when natural threats come toward them, an indifference which, as St. John Paul II knew, only makes things worse: “Some threats come from nature itself, but they are made worse by the culpable indifference and negligence of those who could in some cases remedy them.”[Source:Pope St. John Paul II, Evangelium Vitae]\nCOVID, as it continues to evolve and comes to us in new forms, remains a threat which we should not take likely. While we have a better handle on how to deal with it, and we are better protected against it if we are vaccinated, this does not mean we are entirely in the clear. Vaccinated people can still die from COVID. Vaccinated people can still have long-term effects due to COVID. Vaccinated people can still spread COVID to others. Obviously, vaccinated people have these issues less than unvaccinated people, but with the way COVID mutates, vaccination proves to be less and less effective, allowing COVID outbreaks to harm even those who are vaccinated. Yet, it seems that way too many people are taking things casually, ignoring the threat of COVID. This is why so many people, even if they manifest significant symptoms indicating they might be infected with COVID, not only do not get themselves tested to see if they have it, they go about their lives as if they are not a threat to others; they go to work, to the store, to the church, coughing and sneezing without consideration of others, that is, without even taking basic precautions which could help save someone’s life (like wearing a mask). Indifference is especially seen in churches, churches which often only followed lockdown rules with the greatest reluctance. This is why, once lockdowns were removed: so many of them acted as if everything is normal and COVID should no longer a concern, indeed, that its threat was and remains overblown. Churches should know better. The preservation of life, the dignity of life, should be a concern of theirs. Instead of fighting the government on COVID, they should have been some of its greatest supporters, making sure indifference did not lead to needless deaths. Those who ignored COVID or were indifferent to it, and encouraged others to likewise be indifferent, must be seen as being at least partially culpable for all the needless deaths that occurred. They did not provide for their family, nor their community, with what was necessary for its preservation. Such indifference, Scripture suggests, indicates a lack of fidelity to the Gospel: “If any one does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his own family, he has disowned the faith and is worse than an unbeliever” (1 Tim. 5:8 RSV).\nCOVID continues to be a threat. Currently, China is dealing with a major COVID-related disaster as they are experiencing another round of massive COVID infections and hospitalizations. It is said that they have had about 250 million COVID infections in December:\nIn more than three decades of emergency medicine, Beijing-based doctor Howard Bernstein said, he has never seen anything like this. \nPatients are arriving at his hospital in ever-increasing numbers; almost all are elderly and many are very unwell with COVID and pneumonia symptoms, he said. \nBernstein’s account reflects similar testimony from medical staff across China who are scrambling to cope after China’s abrupt U-turn on its previously strict COVID policies this month was followed by a nationwide wave of infections.[Source:article]\nThis, of course, is affecting China’s economy, and as such, will affect the rest of the world: The rapid spread of infection has driven many people indoors and emptied shops and restaurants. Factories and companies are also forced to shut down or cut production because of more workers getting sick. [Source:article]\nThis could give the rest of the world a terrible foreshadowing of what is to come, because, as precedent shows us, what happens in China will soon be experienced by others as well. And, to be sure, while in the United States, things are better than they were, we must not ignore that COVID still is a threat, and many, especially the elderly, are needlessly dying from it because of the indifference we have taken towards it:\nSo far this winter, the rise in Covid-19 appears to be relatively mild – hospitalizations are ticking up in most states, although the overall rate is still just a fraction of what it was during other surges. \nBut for older adults like Stewart, the situation is much more severe. Hospitalizations among seniors are nearing the peak from the Delta surge and rising fast. \nAnd the age gap has never been wider. Since October, the Covid-19 hospitalization rate among seniors has been at least four times higher than average. Even during the first winter surge in 2020, when Covid-19 took a devastating sweep through nursing homes, there was never more than a three-fold difference.[Source:article]\nWe must no longer act as if the threat of COVID is mostly behind us; we must face the fact that, in reality, COVID continues to threaten us all. While we certainly have a better way to deal with it than we did at the beginning of the pandemic, we are not in the clear. COVID continues to mutate, threatening to overcome the medicine we have to deal with it. And, it is clear, many politicians are pushing an agenda to make us grow indifferent to COVID, to think it really is not a serious problem and that all the engagements we have done to deal with it are worse than COVID itself. They would have us forget the millions of deaths associated with COVID, and look away when we see people still dying from it. Sadly, we find many of those who otherwise claim to promote and support the dignity of life are among those who are at the forefront in denying COVID concerns. Their words echo the sentiments of Cain, as they continue to suggest, in one fashion or another, we should not be our brother (or neighbor’s) keeper (and protector). They say this do deny government the power and authority it needs to properly deal with the pandemic. It is, as St. John Paul II understood, the thinking of the evil one which encourages such deadly indifference:\nAt the root of every act of violence against one’s neighbour there is a concession to the “thinking” of the evil one, the one who “was a murderer from the beginning” (Jn 8:44). As the Apostle John reminds us: “For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another, and not be like Cain who was of the evil one and murdered his brother” (1 Jn 3:11-12). Cain’s killing of his brother at the very dawn of history is thus a sad witness of how evil spreads with amazing speed: man’s revolt against God in the earthly paradise is followed by the deadly combat of man against man. [Source:Pope St. John Paul II, Evangelium Vitae]\nThose who promote this difference use a deadly ideology (such as libertarianism) as a way to defend their position; but, it is clear, whatever ideology is used to support such indifference, in the end, it proves to be rather murderous in the way it ignores and denigrates concerns of mass deaths:\nAfter the crime, God intervenes to avenge the one killed. Before God, who asks him about the fate of Abel, Cain, instead of showing remorse and apologizing, arrogantly eludes the question: “I do not know; am I my brother’s keeper?” (Gen 4:9). “I do not know”: Cain tries to cover up his crime with a lie. This was and still is the case, when all kinds of ideologies try to justify and disguise the most atrocious crimes against human beings. “Am I my brother’s keeper?”: Cain does not wish to think about his brother and refuses to accept the responsibility which every person has towards others. We cannot but think of today’s tendency for people to refuse to accept responsibility for their brothers and sisters. Symptoms of this trend include the lack of solidarity towards society’s weakest members-such as the elderly, the infirm, immigrants, children- and the indifference frequently found in relations between the world’s peoples even when basic values such as survival, freedom and peace are involved. [Source:Pope St. John Paul II, Evangelium Vitae]\nWe can and must do better. We must not be indifferent. We must not let people needlessly die just because the way to save them requires some action from us which, though it is but a minor inconvenience for us, we will fight to make sure we are not required to do it (such as wearing a mask during a pandemic). Every time we find ourselves facing a threat to the livelihood of many people in our society, we find ourselves being challenged by God to do what we can to protect and preserve life as much as is possible. We are, as it were, given a chance to prove our good will, or else, to show how much we are like Cain:\nShortly after its account of the creation of the world and of man, the Bible takes up the issue of human relationships. Cain kills his brother Abel and then hears God ask: “Where is your brother Abel?” (Gen 4:9). His answer is one that we ourselves all too often give: “Am I my brother’s keeper?” (ibid.). By the very question he asks, God leaves no room for an appeal to determinism or fatalism as a justification for our own indifference. Instead, he encourages us to create a different culture, in which we resolve our conflicts and care for one another. [Source:Pope St. John Paul II, Evangelium Vitae]\nAs China shows us, COVID continues to be a worldwide threat. We must not let our guard down. We must not be indifferent to its concerns. We must continue to do what we can to help stop its spread and lessen the harm it can cause to those who are infected by it. We must take sound precautions, some which will also prove helpful in dealing with other potential threats like RSV and the flu. We should not act as if those who get sick and die would have otherwise died anyway and so should not be our concern; not only do we not know that would have happened, but if we think that, we show, once again, how little we value life. We must embrace what St John Paul II said, which is, the value of our neighbor, making sure we not only are not indifferent to them, but we love them:\nThis renewed life-style involves a passing from indifference to concern for others, from rejection to acceptance of them. Other people are not rivals from whom we must defend ourselves, but brothers and sisters to be supported. They are to be loved for their own sakes, and they enrich us by their very presence.

Now, Amro joins MintPress to recount the horrifying realities faced by Palestinians at the hands of their Israeli occupiers.\n\nComing back to his house on October 7, world-renowned activist Issa Amro was dragged away by 15 armed Israelis, blindfolded, gagged, and cuffed so tightly he now needs an operation on his hands. The settlers and soldiers kept him imprisoned for days, beating and torturing him, constantly simulating his execution.\nSpeaking with MintPress News, Amro told the story of what life is like for Palestinians living in the West Bank city of Hebron. “In my city where I live now, since October 7, there is a curfew,” he told Mnar Adley and Alan MacLeod.\nBut this curfew is far more restrictive than others. Palestinian families – those who have not already fled the genocidal Israeli violence – are given only six hours a week to leave their homes. They are not even allowed out into their own yards. This means that school has stopped, work has ended, and life is on pause.\nIn those six hours, Palestinian families must buy all their food, pick up essentials such as medicine and conduct any social activities. But being outside is dangerous, as they have to pass though multiple checkpoints with armed guards and AI smart shooters pointing guns at them. Violence from vigilante settler groups is also a danger.\n“It’s scary to walk alone between armed soldiers and armed settlers, all of them pointing their guns at you. Then, when you come back, it takes them five to ten minutes to search every person,” Amro said, revealing that the guards wanted to go so far as to cut open his potatoes and tomatoes to check for “weapons.”\n“It’s a kind of jail” right now, Amro said, although he notes that being in jail is considerably safer than being a Palestinian in Hebron right now.\nIssa Amro is an activist and the co-founder of the grassroots group Youth Against Settlements. He has led campaigns of non-violent civil disobedience against apartheid and Israeli occupation and has been recognized and given awards by international organizations, including the United Nations. He joins MintPress to chronicle recent Israeli attempts to force Palestinians from their homes and their ancestral land.\nWhile leaving the house is extremely dangerous, staying inside is barely safer. Amro and others have experienced Israeli raids where troops tell Palestinians that they have 24 hours to leave or they will be murdered.\n“History is repeating itself,” Amro told Adley and MacLeod today, “Now I understand why my people left in 1948,” referencing the Israeli genocide of three-quarters of a million Palestinians from their land in order to create the state of Israel.\nIt is no exaggeration to call the current Israeli actions genocidal. Indeed, senior Israeli politicians are directly comparing it to the events of 1948. Agriculture Minister Avi Dichter, for example, described his country’s actions as the “Gaza Nakba 2023.” “We are now rolling out the Gaza Nakba,” he told local outlet Channel 12 on Saturday. “From an operational point of view, there is no way to wage a war – as the Israeli army seeks to do in Gaza – with masses between the tanks and the soldiers,” he added."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 0, "end": 48}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 51, "end": 186}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 112, "end": 124}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 188, "end": 372}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 235, "end": 288}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 827, "end": 902}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1168, "end": 1174}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 1268, "end": 1274}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1589, "end": 1607}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2124, "end": 2276}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2279, "end": 2510}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2513, "end": 2639}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2678, "end": 2978}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2735, "end": 2742}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2938, "end": 3120}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 3124, "end": 3191}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 3278, "end": 3546}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 3548, "end": 3801}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3681, "end": 3698}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4143, "end": 4181}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4183, "end": 4351}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5126, "end": 5397}], "article_id": "42138", "lang": "en", "text": "All Climatologists Do Not Agree on Global Warming\n\nHave key scientific journals become a monolithic industry of fear-peddling, hardwired to an unprecedented degree with confirmation bias?

Perhaps for the same reasons I just did in an academic paper about wildfires in Nature, one of the world’s most prestigious journals: it fits a simple storyline that rewards the person telling it.\nThe above-noted academic paper—entitled “Climate warming increases extreme daily wildfire growth risk in California”—focuses exclusively on how climate change affects extreme wildfire behavior.\n“I knew not to try to quantify key aspects other than climate change in my research because it would dilute the story that prestigious journals like Nature and its rival, Science, want to tell,” Brown added.\nHe went on to say that since such high-profile “scientific” journals are increasingly rigid “gatekeepers” for academic success, these journals’ editors have made it unmistakably clear, in terms of what opinions they’ll accept or reject, that they only want “preapproved narratives—even when those narratives come at the expense of broader knowledge for society.”\nBrown also observed: Climate science has become less about understanding the complexities of the world and more about serving as a kind of Cassandra, urgently warning the public about the dangers of climate change. However understandable this instinct may be, it distorts a great deal of climate science research, misinforms the public, and, most importantly, makes practical solutions more difficult to achieve.\nLibertarian-leaning ABC News veteran John Stossel, writing for the New York Post last month, spoke to climatologist Judith A. Curry, former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology. She concurred that scientists who want a successful career “have an incentive to exaggerate risk to pursue ‘fame and fortune’.”\nShe should know, since, at one time, she was among those bellowing about the “climate change” bogeyman that’s supposedly about to engulf us all, via either super floods or crushing droughts, unless we ditch backyard cookouts, swap our illicit gas-chuggers for all-electric vehicles, and eat bugs. The media was rather cozy with Curry then. She had dutifully published a study suggesting that “climate change” was causing an alleged dramatic increase in the intensity of hurricanes.\n“We found that the percent of category 4 and 5 hurricanes had doubled,” she told Stossel, adding that the media relayed her hurricane claims uncritically. She also noted that the climate alarmist establishment realized that the future of knighting the winners and crucifying the losers in terms of scientific discourse and career advancement belonged to those who tied any and all extreme weather events to “global warming.”\nYet another scientific figure whose experiences drive home even further the fact that today’s climate science is unscientific in its merciless savaging of anything other than gloomy, nebulous perspectives is Nobel Laureate Dr. John Clauser (Physics 2022).\nAccording to a recent report published in Newsweek, Clauser “was to present a seminar on climate models to the International Monetary Fund,” but the talk was “summarily cancelled.” Reportedly, IMF Independent Evaluation Office Director Pablo Moreno had read literature for a July 25 online talk by Clauser and immediately nixed the event.\nWhat was Clauser’s chief transgression? He has suggested that carbon dioxide, which the mainstream scientific autocracy sees as perhaps the most dangerous among the “greenhouse gases,” is beneficial to society. Clauser evidently did not mention that CO2 comprises a smidgen of the atmosphere, with the National Energy and Technology Laboratory noting: Carbon dioxide occurs naturally in small amounts [about 0.04%] in the Earth’s atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a minor part of the air that humans breathe. It is also a byproduct of our body’s metabolism and is subsequently exhaled from the lungs.\nAll this sidesteps the broader view that significant manmade “climate change” does exist, but it comes in the form of long-term cloud-seeding programs that go back decades in the records of the UN’s World Meteorological Organization and in other weather-modification permits submitted to the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation as well as other local and regional governments.\nYet, nightly weather reports never acknowledge that public and private entities are monkeying with the weather in this fashion in the U.S. and around the world. The politically driven “climate change” narrative is all the scientific and media establishment seek to promote."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 0, "end": 61}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 271, "end": 377}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3509, "end": 3592}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3910, "end": 4081}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3933, "end": 3958}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4084, "end": 4141}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4971, "end": 4993}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5103, "end": 5382}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5305, "end": 5323}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 5709, "end": 5828}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6415, "end": 6612}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6476, "end": 6492}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6638, "end": 6988}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6991, "end": 7291}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 7646, "end": 7742}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 7745, "end": 7781}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 7784, "end": 7866}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 7869, "end": 8029}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 8055, "end": 8290}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 8232, "end": 8277}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 8293, "end": 8415}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 8749, "end": 9109}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 9182, "end": 9305}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 9543, "end": 9590}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 9594, "end": 9816}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 10030, "end": 10184}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 10736, "end": 10747}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 11007, "end": 11205}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 11207, "end": 11336}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 11207, "end": 11278}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 11416, "end": 11563}], "article_id": "42139", "lang": "en", "text": "COP28 roadshow: Nigeria’s gains in push for new climate action\n\nThe Federal Government is counting its gains from COP28, after parties sought transition away from fossil fuels, operationalised loss and damage, mobilised more than $85billion in new financial commitments, which are crucial actions that will help to shape a better, cleaner world with greater equitable prosperity, writes CHINEDUM UWAEGBULAM.\n\nNigeria was on the path of history recently when the 28th Conference of Parties (COP28) concluded with 198 parties endorsing a landmark agreement “The UAE Consensus” that sets out an ambitious climate agenda to keep 1.5°C within reach.\nAmong other things, the UAE Consensus calls on parties to transition away from fossil fuels to reach net zero, encourages them to submit economy-wide Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), including a new specific target to triple renewables, double energy efficiency by 2030, and build momentum towards a new architecture for climate finance.\nThe consensus follows a year of inclusive diplomatic engagements and two weeks of intense negotiations, where parties agreed on the operationalisation of the loss and damage, totaling more than $700 million. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) received a boost to its second replenishment with six countries, with total pledges now standing at a record $12.8 billion from 31 countries.\nEight donor governments also announced new commitments to the Least Developed Countries Fund and Special Climate Change Fund totaling more than $174 million, while new pledges, totaling nearly $188 million were made to the Adaptation Fund. These financial pledges are far short of the trillions eventually needed to support developing countries with clean energy transitions, implementing their national climate plans and adaptation efforts.\nNigeria was not left out in the bargain, as the President Bola Tinubu-led delegation also made significant gains, which was enumerated by the Information Minister, Mohammed Idris.\nNigeria and Germany signed a performance agreement on the implementation of the Presidential Power Initiative (PPI) to improve electricity supply in the country.\nTinubu hosted a high-level meeting with stakeholders and investors on the Nigeria Carbon Market and the Electric Buses Rollout Programme, where the Nigeria Carbon Market Activation Plan, co-chaired by the Executive Chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Mr. Zacch Adedeji, and the Director-General of the National Council on Climate Change (NCCC), Dr. Dahiru Salisu, were in attendance.\nAlso, heads of several Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) entered into agreements with their counterparts in the UAE. For instance, the NNPC sealed two deals to commercialise the country’s Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) for domestic and international markets to ensure that the country earns the much-needed revenue from its abundant gas assets.\nMoreover, after signing a strategic partnership agreement between themselves on research and development projects aimed at enhancing the quality, reliability, and affordability of rural electrification solutions, the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) and National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI), signed an MOU with Shenzhen Technology Development Company of China, through its subsidiary, Lemi Renewable Energy Limited. This agreement is targeted at the development and establishment of a $150 million Lithium Battery Manufacturing and Processing Factory in Nigeria.\nDespite these achievements, delegates’ representation threw up a massive controversy. Unsurprisingly, the UAE has the largest-ever registered delegation of any country, with 4,409 badges. This was followed by Brazil with 3,081 and then China and Nigeria, who have both issued 1,411 badges. Other that followed in toe were Indonesia with 1,229, Japan with 1,067, and Turkey with 1,045.\nIdris, however, countered the claim of an over-bloated delegation, saying that the country’s official delegation was 422 delegates, which is a far cry from the figure peddled at the summit.\nIf the figures released by the minister are anything to go, the country would have spent over N1, 644,423,014, comprising N1, 097, 200,000 for economy flight @ N2.6 million return tickets for each delegate, and N547, 223, 014 for accommodation @N1, 296, 737 for 13 nights per person, excluding feeding and other logistics on COP28.\nThe expenses are expected to be higher since some of the delegates are ministers and senior government officials, who have privileges of first class/business tickets, or luxury apartments.\nFor experts and civil society groups, Nigeria has not been taking advantage of its position as the largest economy in Africa, even as its approaches to COPs over the years have been questionable.\nFor the Director, Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF), Nnimmo Bassey, the country’s delegation to Dubai was unduly large mainly because the COP was approached as a roadshow for investment drive judging from the number of memoranda of agreement signed at the Nigerian Pavilion during three COPs.\n“Unfortunately, treating the COP as a trade fair misses the point of the multilateral space, which is primarily for serious negotiations. Side deals weaken the hands of vulnerable nations as they cannot vigorously confront the polluters with demands for justice over the resolution. This is why the COPs have weakened considerations of the Common But Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR) principle and now operate on the NDCs- an approach that negates the requirements of binding emissions reduction by polluting nations, but allows for convenience as a major determinant of action.”\nAccording to Bassey, Nigeria’s gains or losses at COP28 can best be assessed by looking at what turned out in favour of the African continent. “In that sense, we recall that Africa went to the COP28 primarily with the outcome of the African Climate Summit, which was held in Nairobi. The key expectations of the continent included the drive for sufficient finance for the needed energy transition and the operationalising of the Loss and Damage Fund.\n“The leaders resolved to aim for ‘green development’, an oxymoron, and green industrialisation. They also went with the mindset of having bountiful critical green mineral reserves and vast swathes of lands and forests to serve as carbon sinks and to generate carbon credits.\n“Those basic expectations are recipes for the entrenchment of green colonialism – an extractivist approach that benefits polluters and compounds the problems confronting the victims of climate change,” he said\nHe continued: “Nigeria’s position as a staunch defender of OPEC’s position not to agree to a fossil fuels phase-out was also not laudable. However, it can be said that with Nigeria’s government ‘gained’ from the COP outcome agreement to only transition from fossil fuels, while promoting unnamed transition energy resources, which will definitely include fossil gas.\n“This specious gain will see Nigeria digging for more oil and gas for export, as is the trend across the continent. We note that over 85 per cent of the infrastructure on the continent is installed for exports showing that they are not extracted to meet the energy needs of the people on the continent.”\nBassey said that Nigeria needs a bottom-up national stock-take on voluntary actions to draw up what is needed to address the impacts at home, regionally, and globally. This should include scenarios for embarking on adaptation and mitigation measures with deep consideration of the complex roots of the crisis using both historical and current lenses.\n“Nigeria must realise that the transition from fossil fuels has begun no matter what we may think. The days of fossil fuels are numbered. Rather than talk of decarbonising, the world will soon be speaking of depetrolising. Within the coming decades, the global North will halt the production of internal combustion engines and Africa risks becoming the cemetery for such automobiles,” he said.\nHe stated that the COP cannot be allowed to continue as a carbon trade fair where lands and forests are auctioned as carbon sinks to permit polluting nations and corporations to continue with reckless exploitation and neocolonial grabbing of resources.\nFor the Chairman of Nigeria Environment Study/Action Team (NEST), Prof. Chinedu Nwajiuba, the gains come in different forms. “Nigerians, working in and outside the country, various government and non-government activists involved with the subject of climate change and related matters, showcased what they have been doing. Interested parties at the global level interacted with participants at this level, and some partnerships and linkages were created.\n“We have a new government and officials may have been interested in getting involved, acquiring some knowledge, exploring some of the promised financial resources, and such interests. Some international bodies and agencies are interested in implementing programmes and projects in Nigeria were able to establish relevant relationships with Nigeria-based partners. Most of these will usually imply financial inflows into the country.\n“I also know of critical stakeholders, who should be at the COP but were not, while their peers in other countries were there. One of such is the universities. At COPs, most well-known universities from all over the world come to showcase their researches and inventions, and market such to investors, as well as meet with funders of researches and innovations. Nigeria’s universities have been missing on that,” said Nwajiuba, a former vice-chancellor of Alex Ekwueme Federal University, Ebonyi State.\nHe advised that Nigeria should always be at the COP because “we belong to the UN systems and signatory to all the relevant agreements. The government-funded delegates may not be as many as was reported in 2023, but certainly, the COP should not be what few Nigerians should attend. I want to see Nigerian universities and more youths attending.”\nThe Executive Secretary of HEDA Resource Centre, Sulaimon Arigbabu, said that Nigeria could gain much more from multilateral negotiations and opportunities. “The country is still not taking good advantage of many factors that could work for us, such as the number of our official delegations and unofficial participants.’’Our weight is not felt in the negotiations as much as could be,”\nFor many years, activists have been at the forefront of advocating that the Nigerian government should use its unlimited quota to enable the participation of many more Nigerians who could make positive input into the country’s general experience at the COPs or similar conferences. So, this year, what people termed as over-bloated delegations were citizens from the civil society, academia, faith, entertainment, and business communities, who took advantage of the government’s facilitation to attend the conference and pay their bills.\nHe called for the audit of official COP delegates. “From the over 422-man delegation that the FG claimed to have sponsored, how many of them are experts who are negotiating for us? What are their competencies? Who are they, and how were they selected? That process is not open, and these people are not known to stakeholders. Therefore, public accountability is difficult to achieve. There is still a lot of patronage and ambiguity about the selection process. The problem is not the size of our delegation. It is the lack of a strategic plan to maximise the benefits of such for the interest of the country,” Arigbabu said.\nHe said: “We must do internal stock-taking, knowledge and information sharing before the conferences. Currently, just one meeting hurriedly put together before the COP is ineffective. We need to know our negotiators; what are Nigeria’s positions on critical issues? We need to have better engagement and plan that every Nigerian participating at the COP, whether government sponsored or not, have a stake, can access guidance and information on the agenda promoted by Africa and Nigeria in particular.”"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Slogans", "start": 0, "end": 43}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 46, "end": 363}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 129, "end": 144}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 646, "end": 838}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 826, "end": 829}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 1232, "end": 1335}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1791, "end": 1842}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1916, "end": 2283}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 2290, "end": 2374}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 2563, "end": 2737}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3095, "end": 3251}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 3449, "end": 3621}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3643, "end": 3838}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 3841, "end": 3928}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 3931, "end": 4004}], "article_id": "4214", "lang": "en", "text": "Two Climate Change Wrongs Don't Make a Right\n\nIn his State of the Union address, President Obama launched his latest campaign in the war of ideas over global warming and what to do about it. This time, instead of a mandatory cap on greenhouse gas emissions, he proposes that Congress enact a clean energy standard though just what will count as clean remains fuzzy.\nMany Republicans will doubtless again respond by challenging the science that shows that greenhouse gas emissions could cause harmful climate change. Were such challenges directed at poking holes in the often hyped claims of green advocates, they would serve the public interest. But Senator James Inhofe and many other Republicans go much farther, claiming that manmade climate change is a huge scientific hoax and that greenhouse gas emissions pose no risk.\nHoax, really? Svante Arrhenius, a Swedish Nobel laureate chemist, first described the greenhouse effect in 1896. Science, then, has long known that carbon dioxide and some other naturally occurring gases in the atmosphere cause Earth to be about 30 degrees C warmer than it otherwise would be. Mankind, by burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests, is adding to the atmospheres stock of warming gases. If that process continues, all else being equal, simple logic tells us that the planet will warm further. Warming is highly likely to affect rainfall, clouds, ice cover, and much else.\nThat said, the size, timing, and economic impacts of manmade emissions remain unclear. Some climate system responses to the build-up of greenhouse gases are known to dampen the extent of warming and some to amplify it. The balance between the two responses remains under debate. In other words, a given increment of emissions could produce a lot of change or only a little.\nThus, climate science provides at best hazy guidance. Even so, some scientists are calling for stringent curbs on emissions. Their demands largely ignore the need for policy to factor in economic and political realities that lie outside the scope of climate science and that are far beyond the ken of most climate scientists. These scientists, moreover, have been quite lax about distinguishing which of their statements rest solely on science and which voice their personal policy preferences.\nMr. Obama, in order to cloak his proposals in the mantel of science, is happy to go along. But noting that greenhouse gas emissions do imply some risk of harmful climate change is a far cry from concluding that the Obama clean energy standard is in the U.S. national interest. For one thing, a ton of carbon dioxide has the same effect on climate regardless of where it is emitted; therefore, halting manmade warming requires cutting emissions globally. In fact, the U.S. accounts for only about a fifth of the worlds total, and, as emissions from China, India, Brazil, and other developing countries surge massively, the U.S. share of the total is falling fast.\nThe developing countries, meanwhile, have staunchly rejected all pleas to accept slower economic growth as the price of limiting their emissions. They know that climate change poses a threat, but they judge that rapid economic growth is the best armor against the ill effects that it might someday bring.\nMr. Obama would do well to ask himself if this insight might also apply to the U.S. A rich endowment of human and physical capital is a key to being able to adjust to climate change at low cost. Buying emission cuts at too dear a price will reduce our resources for adapting to climate change, much of which is unavoidable given the choices of the developing countries. Conversely, if Mr. Obama still nurtures hopes of persuading China, India, and others to curb their emissions, using U.S. emission cuts as a bargaining chip would offer more hope than would handing them over for free.\nInstead, the president is trying again for the climate version of unilateral disarmament. One can only hope that Republicans have the votes to reject his new scheme. As to an intelligent debate about how best to cope with the risks of climate change, that, clearly, must await another day."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 0, "end": 72}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 164, "end": 252}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 536, "end": 867}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 718, "end": 746}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 869, "end": 961}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 965, "end": 1013}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1000, "end": 1006}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1102, "end": 1289}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 1292, "end": 1346}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1348, "end": 1432}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1546, "end": 1600}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 2043, "end": 2225}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2147, "end": 2225}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2228, "end": 2502}], "article_id": "42140", "lang": "en", "text": "Britt: Don’t let Democrats run from ‘moment before birth’ abortion policy\n\nOhio voters approved adding certain abortion rights to the state’s constitution Tuesday, causing concern among some conservative Republicans that the party is losing on the issue.\nThe GOP also lost some important elections in Kentucky and Virginia.\nU.S. Sen Katie Britt (R-Montgomery) believes that the Republican Party needs to learn from its mistakes and put out a better message.\nBritt discussed the recent elections Thursday on WVNN’s “The Yaffee Program.”\n“I think what we have to do is take a step back, take a look at what we’re doing and how we’re doing it,” Britt said. “I think we have to work diligently to change hearts and minds. No good thing is usually easy. Doing a hard thing will be hitting this head on. We must work to protect life and we must work on how we message this.”\nThe senator thinks her party needs to highlight the radical position of Democrats on abortion.\n“We know that the Democrats have an extreme policy and yet we’ve allowed them to control the airwaves and deflect from that,” she argued. “It was last year when every single Democrat voted to be able to take the life of a child the moment before a child was born. And that’s not something that we should allow them to run from. I believe that is not where people in this nation are.”\nBritt said many of states’ current abortion policies are among the worse in the world.\n“Having abortions after 24 weeks puts the U.S…in a category with only four other nations with regards to that, and one of them is China and one of them is North Korea,” she explained. “And so I certainly don’t want to be in a category with them on this or much of anything.”\nShe emphasized the need for her party to “do better” when it comes to reaching voters on some of the most important issues the country faces.\n“I think we’ve got to just do better,” she said. “We’ve got to be honest about it and figure out how we do a better job of talking on talking to voters. I think we’re right on policy issues.

It is also one of the deadliest ideologies. However, it is considered marginal in terms of the number of advocates.  Yet, as regards the writings, articles and books published, Zionism occupies a dominant position in the media, academia, and international politics. It is undeniable that this is an important subject in the fields of political science, history, and social sciences.\r\nZionism is at the origin of one of the most unlikely political actions in history, where individuals of a people or community decide it is time to return to their land they left two thousand years ago.\r\nZionism causes irritation, misunderstanding, offense, and even outrage, in addition to causing death. Some are embarrassed by its arrogance and high-handed behavior, as well as the violence of some of its discourses and inhumane actions. It is also strange because it often presents itself as a winner on one side and a victim on the other. \r\nIn its latest report on the Israeli-Palestinian situation, the NGO Human Rights Watch, states that the Jewish state now corresponds to an apartheid state, based on the definition of differential treatment of citizens according to their ethnic or religious origin.\r\nThere is no simple solution to this conflict, but refusing to recognize the legitimacy of each can only prevent peace from being achieved. This drama is not limited to the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts, which are those that occur between the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza and the Israelis, nor to the Israeli-Arab conflicts, which are those that occur between Israel and its more or less distant neighbors, such as Iran. It also includes conflicts between Jews and Palestinians in the State of Israel.  On both sides, many Israeli citizens are not Zionists. The situation is extremely complex. \r\nThis tragedy is shared by both Israelis and Palestinians. The path to peace is long and it is inevitable that it will cross the difficult path of self-criticism. \r\nAs a reminder, here are some causes of the upsurge of violence in the region: 1) In Syria, we witness the annexation by Israel of the Golan Heights since the Six Day War in 1967; repeated violations of Syria's airspace and maritime space.  2) In Lebanon, we see Israel’s continued occupation of the Chabha farms in southern Lebanon; its military support for the Christian militias in southern Lebanon, created with Israel’s help, and its desire to disarm the Hezbollah militias; frequent violations of Lebanese airspace and sea. 3) In Palestine, Israeli forces refuse to withdraw from the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, despite United Nations resolutions; expropriations of Palestinian lands and construction of settlements in the Negev desert and the occupied West Bank; imprisonment of about five thousand Palestinians, including children; land and sea blockade imposed on Gaza despite Israel’s “withdrawal” from that territory; blackmail about tax money collected by Israel and owed to the Palestinian Authority; desire to annex the Al-Aqsa Mosque to Jerusalem (in fact all of East Jerusalem to make this multi-faith city the capital of Israel), under the pretext that it was built on an old Jewish temple; discrimination in the distribution of drinking and irrigation water ; daily vexations and abuses, etc.\r\nToday, there is so much to tell about the human tragedy that has struck the Palestinian people since their land was colonized by Israel. By appropriating eight-tenths of Palestinian territory since its creation in 1948, Israel ended Palestinian nationality and dealt a severe blow to the identity of this people. Those who remained in the part of the Palestinian territory occupied by Israel became Israelis. But second-class Israelis, discriminated on the basis of their faith and identity and reduced according to their status as colonized people.\r\nTwo-thirds of Gazans live in refugee camps in the Gaza Strip and whose families were expelled from their towns or villages in 1948 during the attacks of the Zionist pioneers. They have remained refugees in their own land for generations since that year.\r\nIn addition, following an intense battle for power in the Gaza Strip between Hamas, an Islamist party, and Fatah, the party of Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbass, Hamas won the parliamentary elections on January 25, 2006 to choose a new Palestinian Legislative Council. Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip after its victory. It should be noted that the majority of women voted for Hamas. Fatah left the Gaza Strip and has now only control over the West Bank, if that can be considered control when one is under Zionist occupation. The president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbass, actually has very limited authority.\r\nThe election observation mission mandated by the European Union openly stated that the parliamentary elections were conducted in full transparency and regularity. However, the European Union does not recognize the results that led to the victory of Hamas, which it has since considered a terrorist group. While proclaiming the victory of Hamas, Israel, which had founded and funded the Hamas movement in order to discredit Fatah, worked hard to sabotage the elections. \r\nSince Hamas won the Gaza Strip in June 2007, there has been a struggle between this party and Fatah that has led to tensions between them. Israeli leaders are particularly determined to suffocate the Gazan population, a policy supported by Western countries that do not recognize the authority of Hamas.\r\nSince Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007 and Egypt closed its Rafah border crossing, Israel has imposed a blockade that has hampered the social and economic life of Gazans. The bill is still in force in 2023, 17 years later. The UN estimates that Israel’s blockade of Gaza cost nearly $17 billion.\r\nIsrael restricts maritime access to Gaza and prohibits shipping. The city is also prevented from building port facilities. At the risk of being killed by Israeli border guards, the fishermen cannot fish offshore and must content themselves with navigating the area near the coast.\r\nPalestinians are prohibited from travelling between Gaza and the West Bank. As a result, families cannot visit each other.  Since 2008, Israel has carried out massive bombings on Gaza. The current war demonstrates the devastating impact of relentless bombing and heavy artillery fire on the civilian population. In 48 days of conflict, about 15,000 Palestinian civilians have lost their lives, including at least six thousand children, and the human toll is expected to rise. More than one million Gazans are displaced or injured and thousands of homes are destroyed. This nightmarish scenario takes place in Gaza and the West Bank where localities like Nablus, Jenin, Khan Younes, Rafah, Bayt Hanoun, and others are attacked by explosive weapons.\r\nAccording to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the crisis is expected to affect two million people who need urgent humanitarian assistance. Reports continue to report civilians trapped in bombed areas. Severe shortages of essential health supplies, fuel and cash are reported in the Palestinian territory, with increased insecurity affecting access to basic services.  The Bureau is particularly concerned about the situation of persons with disabilities, the elderly or vulnerable, who face considerable difficulties in meeting their basic needs, such as finding shelter and accessing food. They are trapped and left behind. They need accessible information, safe evacuation routes, shelters and vital medical supplies.\r\nThe international community is deeply concerned about the significant loss of life and civilian damage caused by the use of heavy explosive weapons in populated areas, but also by internationally prohibited weapons such as cluster munitions. \r\nShelling and artillery fire in Palestinian cities also caused damage and destruction of civilian infrastructure such as homes, hospitals, schools, water systems, electricity and sanitation infrastructure and communication networks, disrupting access to essential services. Explosive remnants of war will contaminate the land and affect communities long after the war ends.\r\nWe call for a permanent ceasefire and respect for international law, including unfettered access to humanitarian aid. Ending military intervention is critical to protecting civilian lives. \r\nThe international community must do everything in its power to prevent this from happening again. The events in Palestine demonstrate the urgency of adopting the political declaration against the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. \r\nThe extermination of Gazans carried out by the Zionist state that has claimed thousands of victims is a real genocide in the literal sense of the term. The health crisis adds to the humanitarian crisis. The impact of the invasion on women and children is catastrophic.\r\nIn international law, genocide has been recognized since 1948 by the United Nations convention, which lists a series of crimes, including murder committed “with the intent of destroying, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.”\r\nIs there a possibility of peace between Israel and the Palestinians, or should we simply get used to periodic wars that deprive both sides of the peace and stability they seek? To renounce diplomacy is to accept the unacceptable: endless wars.\r\nThe history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is littered with failed peace plans, collapsed diplomatic conferences and disillusioned mediators. Yet even amidst the horrors of the Gaza war, calls for a possible two-state solution remain alive and are increasingly being heard.\r\nThe withdrawal of military and civilian colonial forces from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank is the sine qua non condition for establishing peace, offering an opportunity for the Palestinian people to finally found an independent and sovereign Palestinian state.  \r\nThere is only one way to go in Gaza: the two-state solution. It seems feasible from a geographical point of view, provided that a compromise is found on the territories to be exchanged.\r\nThe main barrier to two-state resolution is political. The cessation of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations after the creation of a Palestinian national unity government integrating Hamas in the spring of 2014 shows that there is still a long way to go.\r\nThere is still a long way to go. Therefore, the idea of a Palestinian state was no longer on the Israeli political agenda or the international agenda. Even when former US President Donald Trump proposed the “deal of the century” in 2019, where he still referred to the hypothesis of such a state by conditioning it, conditionality was to accept a partial state, with no army and no independent airspace for a $50 billion mega economic development project. Instead, it turned its back on UN resolutions and ignored the nationalist aspirations of the Palestinians.  He announced Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, the annexation of parts of the Jordan Valley to the occupied West Bank and the abolition of the right of return of the Palestinians. This deal was turned down by Fatah and Hamas.\r\nMoreover, the Arab regimes gave an incongruous place to the Palestinian cause in their foreign policy agendas for a long time. The current war is aggravating relations between the two warring parties and putting the Israeli-Palestinian conflict back on the agenda.\r\nThe two-state theory is based on the idea that we face two nationalisms: Zionism and the Palestinian national liberation movement, each claiming a nation-state. The Oslo Accords, which were signed in 1993, are of historical importance because they formally set out this demand and perspective.\r\nSince the Oslo Accords have not been implemented and the settlements of the West Bank have continued to spread on the ground, the creation of a viable Palestinian state becomes de facto distant but more crucial than ever.\r\nNow that the humanitarian disaster in Gaza has brought the issue to the forefront, it is clear that there can be no resolution without some decisive steps towards a two-state solution despite the escalation of violence and even though the obstacles are enormous. Extremists on both sides want to control all the land between the river and the sea by any means necessary. If one or the other gains ground, this war will become even more deadly than it already is.\r\nThe optimal approach is therefore to adopt the renewed perspective of a two-state solution to rapidly galvanize the moderate forces of both parties. Such a conjecture will not apply without a strong and sustained international commitment from the United States, the European Union, Russia, and all Arab states.\r\nYet, after the horrors of this genocide, how could both sides choose to move closer rather than away? The European experience provides a significant lesson in this domain. New social movements and political coalitions must be created and sustained by the supporters of lasting peace. To create a new political entity, Europe has overcome two centuries of wars caused by deep divisions between ethnicities, religions, politics, and cultures. \r\nThe \"old continent\" became a new type of political entity less than a decade after the Second World War, with its religious and nationalist wars, its great power intrigues and the endless redistribution of national borders. It is now time for Israelis and Palestinians seeking peace to dare to envision an identical future for themselves. As the Chinese proverb says, “Peace and quiet is happiness”.

And about 41 percent Europe’s imports come from Russia, or about 3.73 trillion cubic feet a year, 24 percent from Norway at 2.2 trillion cubic feet and 11 percent from Algeria at 1 trillion.\nThe Nord Stream 2 was suspended by Germany because of the war and was built from 2018 and finished construction in Sept. 2021 at a cost of $11 billion, and would have doubled the current pipeline’s distribution of 1.9 trillion cubic feet a year to 3.9 trillion cubic feet a year. In Nov. 2021, Germany delayed final regulatory approval of the pipeline project before the war. Germany already purchases about 55 percent of its natural gas from Russia before the new pipeline has even gone online.\nWestern dependence on Russian oil and gas as a main source has absolutely become a threat to national security to everyone paying attention. Now, after the invasion, Germany realizes the threat and is building two new liquified natural gas terminals to take in more imports, and is increasing military spending. They are pivoting.\nBut independence will not happen overnight. Germany is still so dependent on Russian oil and gas that German Economy Minister Robert Habeck told reporters on March 1 that Berlin opposes an embargo on Russian energy imports: “I wouldn’t support an embargo on imports of fossil fuels from Russia… I would even speak out against it, because we would threaten the social peace in the republic with that.”\nPresident Joe Biden announced new sanctions on Russia, and is releasing 30 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but like Germany is also holding back on an embargo or even on more drilling. Is the U.S. lagging behind?\nIn a recent Morning Consult poll conducted on behalf of the American Petroleum institute on March 1, 84 percent of Americans agreed, with 63 percent strongly agreeing, with the statement “Producing natural gas and oil here in the U.S. helps make our country and allies more secure against actions by other countries such as Russia.” That included 88 percent of Republicans, 83 percent of Democrats and 78 percent of independents.\nWhat is less obvious to voters is that federal energy policy goes way beyond easy-to-understand permits allowing drilling on federal lands or agreements with Canada authorizing the Keystone XL Pipeline to be built. And these other policies play a far more influential role in hampering energy policy not just for the U.S., but advanced economies throughout the West.\nThe federal government the past seven years has opened the door for left-wing Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investing via private retirement funds regulated under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) via a regulation by the Obama Labor Department in 2015.\nThe Obama rule allowed pension plan managers to give additional weight to companies touting ESG goals that focus on green energy, cleaning up the environment, are anti-oil, anti-coal, anti-carbon, but also anti-tobacco, anti-guns, embracing critical race theory, implementing diversity and inclusion racial and gender hiring quotas and practices and other left-wing issues.\nSuffice to say, having a high ESG rating gives a company weighted investments in ESG funds—and for companies focused on green energy at the expense of oil and coal, it has paid off handsomely, even while U.S. energy independence and security has suffered.\nFinancial incentives like this are why in part stocks like Tesla have recently rallied to more than $1,100 per share before the market’s recent correction despite not generating much profits for years, because they are weighted so heavily by ESG funds. With ESG investing, profits are divorced from valuation and saving the world takes precedence.\nBig ESG funds like BlackRock, a hedge fund with more than $9 trillion of assets under management, have placed green activists onto the board of Exxon to make it a “not-oil” company. And so forth.\nUnder President Joe Biden the $762 billion federal Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) for federal employee retirees will be investing in ESG funds as well going into effect in 2022, following state government employee retirement funds in California, New York, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland and Oregon that have made similar investments for years. Those are tax dollars, paid into government employee retirement plans going directly to funding green energy, at the expense of particularly oil and coal.\nThanks to the combination of incentives and direct funds, ESG funds, which total $38 trillion out more than $100 trillion global assets under management, will grow to $53 trillion by 2025, according to Bloomberg News. And it will crush carbon-based energy, hampering the West economically and militarily by limiting options in the event of war.\nThe whole point of ESG is to restrict capital investment from flowing into proven carbon-based energies that the West now urgently needs, which is exactly what happened to Europe and the UK — and now Russia has them over a barrel. Congress should consider prohibiting the use of federal funds, including pensions, for implementing the ESG regulation incentivizing green investment at the expense of carbon-based energy including oil and coal.\nNow, even Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whose company’s market cap has increased by hundreds of billions of dollars because of ESG investing is calling for more oil and drilling, writing on Twitter on March 4: “Hate to say it, but we need to increase oil & gas output immediately. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures… Obviously, this would negatively affect Tesla, but sustainable energy solutions simply cannot react instantaneously to make up for Russian oil & gas exports.\nESG is neutering the West, endangering national security and emboldening our adversaries by making the U.S. and Europe increasingly dependent on Russia.\nIn a world at war, energy independence equals sovereign freedom and independence. The question is: Does the West still want to be free? If so, then it’s time to drill — and to defund ESG."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 0, "end": 144}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 28, "end": 44}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 148, "end": 410}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 302, "end": 320}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 556, "end": 641}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 587, "end": 602}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 713, "end": 770}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1262, "end": 1338}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 1263, "end": 1338}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1530, "end": 1541}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 1752, "end": 1765}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 1807, "end": 1822}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2230, "end": 2245}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2267, "end": 2300}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2428, "end": 2465}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2470, "end": 2516}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 2524, "end": 2597}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2610, "end": 2721}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2896, "end": 3015}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 3062, "end": 3078}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 3373, "end": 3498}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4091, "end": 4139}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 4276, "end": 4472}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4641, "end": 4654}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 6510, "end": 6728}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6562, "end": 6577}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6831, "end": 6844}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 7098, "end": 7321}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 7644, "end": 7887}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 7867, "end": 7887}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 8165, "end": 8280}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 8899, "end": 9303}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 9480, "end": 9496}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 9758, "end": 9773}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 9935, "end": 10196}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 10815, "end": 10840}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 11117, "end": 11336}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 11339, "end": 11447}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 11693, "end": 11705}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 11708, "end": 11828}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 12031, "end": 12093}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 12237, "end": 12253}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 13014, "end": 13180}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 13182, "end": 13318}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 13320, "end": 13454}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 13471, "end": 13493}], "article_id": "42143", "lang": "en", "text": "Amid Israel-Hamas conflict, 'information war' plays out on social media, experts say\n\n\"Online, what speaks powerfully is images,\" one expert said.\n\nIn the wake of Hamas' unprecedented surprise attack inside Israel, a battle is being waged on the streets of Gaza, with guns and tanks following Israel's retaliatory bombing campaign.

So, you have a wider battle, let's call it an information war,\" David Patrikarakos, a war correspondent and author of the book \"War in 140 Characters: How Social Media is Shaping Conflict in the Twenty-First Century,\" told ABC News.\nCiting a disparity between pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian social media posts, Max Boot, a military historian and a foreign policy analyst, told ABC News he believes, \"Israel is losing the information war because it's the battle of victimhood.\"\nA recent study by The Washington Post found that the number of pro-Palestinian hashtags used on the TikTok, Instagram and Facebook platforms has dwarfed pro-Israeli hashtags since the Hamas terror group attacked Israel on Oct. 7. Though, TikTok said those hashtag numbers lacked context, since many social media users come from the Middle East and Southeast Asia. On Facebook, The Washington Post found that the #freepalestine hashtag was used 39 times more than the #standwithisrael hashtag and 26 times more on Instagram.\nMore than 1,200 people have been killed and over 6,900 others injured in Israel, according to Israeli officials, and Hamas is believed to be holding more than 230 people hostage. Israel retaliated with missile strikes and a ground incursion that have left more than 14,000 dead in Gaza and 35,000 others injured, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.\nThe terrorist attack in Israel on Oct. 7 was swift and brutal and horrified the world. But with ongoing Israeli retaliatory attacks in Gaza being played out on social media since then, day after day -- in videos that often can't be verified -- the narrative has changed, according to experts.\n\"... The sympathy of a lot people in the world has shifted away from Israelis,\" Boot said, adding that the IDF holding press conferences is very different than seeing the aftermath of the attacks in Gaza.\n\"It's more visceral to show suffering and to express outrage over suffering rather than listen to someone at a press conference,\" Boot said of the social media disparity. \"Israel can just go and say whatever it wants in a press conference, but basically, if you are explaining, you are losing. Online, what speaks powerfully is images.\"\n\n\"Emotional power\" of social media\nOn the Israeli side, the IDF has daily press conferences where officials lay out the news from the front to international journalists, their spokespeople do interviews across news networks, and the foreign ministry pushes out an infographic campaign on social media platforms. Meanwhile, flyers of kidnapped Israelis believed to be held hostage by Hamas are plastered on walls of cities around the world.\nFor its part, Hamas holds weekly press conferences on the fourth floor of an office building in Beirut, Lebanon. A Hamas spokesperson delivers talking points mostly to an audience of international journalists, even sometimes giving answers in English to the Western press.\nBut while Israel and Hamas are conducting dueling press conferences at podiums inside conference rooms, some of the citizens of Gaza and Israel are using a different method to get their voices heard: TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, dispatching to the world some of the most visceral and engaging content from the frontlines, Patrikarakos told ABC News.\n\"It has huge emotional power,\" Patrikarakos said, referring to social media posts from Gazan journalists. \"On one side, you have this young girl telling a deeply personal story, and on other the side, you have a middle-aged man in a uniform at a podium giving statistics, and it's not going to compete.\"\n\n\"The sky no longer gives me hope\"\nDaily video diaries by social media users about life in a war zone are flooding social media feeds. These accounts have some of the most harrowing descriptions of war and also some of the more mundane, detailing everyday aspects of living in an area under siege.\nOne Gaza-based journalist, Plestia Alaqad, recently posted to her 3.6 million Instagram followers a video of the blue sky above her filling with smoke from a dropped bomb.\n\"The sky always gives me hope,\" the 22-year-old wrote in the post, which garnered more than 200,000 likes. \"I love watching the clouds and their shapes, and I enjoy watching sunsets and sunrises as well ... but now when I look at the sky all I can see is smoke and darkness ... the sky no longer gives me hope.\"\nAlaqad often posts firsthand accounts of the war along with videos showing the aftermath of bombings, some shot from the balcony of her apartment in Gaza. In another recent post on TikTok, the sounds of loud explosions could be heard outside her apartment.\n\"We're inside the house right now and literally we can't breathe,\" Alaqad said in the post. She then went to her balcony and recorded the thick smoke filling the sky. \"No view. You can't see anything,\" she said.\nWhen ABC News attempted to reach Alaqad for an interview, she did not respond. In one of her recent posts, she said, her videos speak for themselves.\n\nA \"messenger\" who says he's debunking misinformation\nOn the Israeli side, Adiel Cohen -- a social media content creator and influencer, and an enlisted IDF reservist currently on the frontlines on Israel's northern border -- told ABC News his number of followers has doubled since the war began.\n\"When it comes to views, likes and engagement and even the amount of pieces of content put out there, we are largely outnumbered,\" the 25-year-old Cohen said, referring to pro-Israel and pro-Jewish content compared to pro-Palestinian social media content.\nCohen recently posted an emotional video from inside Kfar Aza in southern Israel, where numerous residents were killed on Oct. 7 when Hamas terrorists stormed through a security fence at the edge of the kibbutz, shooting indiscriminately at residents, setting fire to homes and killing entire families.\nIn the video, a tearful Cohen described how one woman was in a bomb shelter that was set on fire by the terrorists to force her out.\nCohen -- a college student who boasts more than 51,000 followers on Instagram, 65,000 on TikTok and more than 12,000 on X -- said he sees himself as a pro-Israeli \"messenger\" debunking misinformation that goes around on social media.\n\"I'm not here to read out messages put out by the Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs or something, or the IDF spokespeople,\" Cohen said. \"I'm here to speak of my experience as an Israeli Jew living here through the conflict, suffering from terror, suffering from rocket attacks for years, telling my story as much as I can, as much as the security allows me to as a soldier, as a student who left everything behind and was drafted to a war that was imposed on me.\"\nCohen said he also believes Israel is losing the social media information war.\n\"It's just that there are a lot less of us [Israelis] and there are a lot more of those who claim to be pro-Palestine, and the images from Gaza to the regular person who doesn't understand the context of what's going on are a lot more horrifying,\" Cohen said. \"It also has to do with the popular narrative nowadays that Israel has the upper hand and Palestinians are the underdog in this conflict. And for a lot of people, it's almost impossible when they live abroad, when they live in America, to understand the nuance, that it's not about Israel versus the Palestinians because the war is not against Palestinians, it's against Hamas.\"\nThe unfiltered social media posts from inside Gaza have become a vital source of information for the world as Egypt and Israel control entry into the Gaza Strip, not allowing many foreign reporters to enter independently. The battlefield inside Gaza is mostly off-limits to major international news organizations. An ABC News crew was recently allowed into Gaza while embedded with an IDF unit.\nInside Gaza, citizen journalists, filmmakers, mothers, poets, writers, students and photographers posting on social media say they've seen their engagement exponentially grow as the fighting rages on.\n\"The impact is huge. That's the power of the iPhone, arming people to be media outlets for the democratization of information,\" Valerie Wirtschafter, a fellow from the Brookings Institute studying the impact of emerging technologies, told ABC News. \"At its core, to be able to document and share is really, really important, especially in places that journalists don't have access to because everyday citizens are living there. The challenge is that there is such a high volume of information now that the footage gets muddled with other videos and it's leading to an overarching sense of mistrust.\"\n\n\"Endless violence\"\nGaza photojournalist Motaz Azaiza recently posted to his more than 14.8 million Instagram followers a photo of two Palestinian children lying on a hospital gurney, their heads and limbs bandaged and their faces bloodied. \"Children in Gaza have been witnessing endless violence by the Israeli forces,\" Azaiza wrote in the post, which garnered more than 840,000 likes. \"These children do not deserve what they are currently experiencing.\"\nIn another recent post, Azaiza is seen running through the dust of a recently bombed Gaza neighborhood, horns blaring in the background. \"It was closer to my grandma's house, an airstrike near here!\" he wrote in the post, which was viewed more than 700,000 times.\nHind Khoudary, a Palestinian journalist inside Gaza, has more than 825,000 followers on Instagram, gaining thousands of them after the war started, and that number continues to grow. In a recent post on Instagram that generated more than 100,000 likes, she appealed for assistance in getting flak jackets and protective clothing so she can continue reporting in the region. In a Nov. 8 post, she showed a home reduced to a pile of rubble, saying as she panned the camera over the destruction, \"There are still 24 family members who are buried under this rubble.\"\nPatrikarakos said that under Hamas, Gaza has been a \"hugely patriarchal society.\"\n\"If you were to pick someone who should be the most powerless person in that society, it would be a young female civilian. But now, because of the power of her posts, she [Khoudary] became an incredibly powerful voice for the Palestinian point of view,\" Patrikarakos said.\nBut as Patrikarakos pointed out, there is a greater context to these posts, saying the ultimate tragedy of this war is that the suffering of the citizens of Gaza is being used by Hamas to set their narrative to the world.\n\"Hamas needs influencers to highlight the suffering of its own people because Hamas doesn't have an Air Force. So, it needs the influencers,\" Patrikarakos said. \"You see the more Israel destroys Gaza, the more battlefield victories it has, the less the sympathy of the world because Hamas has a strategy to brandish its own people's bodies to the world. It's the goal. They can't defeat Israel with airpower, so they stack the media with images of dead Gazans and hope that the world sees.\"\nSince its Oct. 7 attack, Hamas has said in multiple statements it was expecting retaliation by Israel, but that it would be the price the group is willing to pay for change for the Palestinian people. \"Will we have to pay a price? Yes, and we are ready to pay it,\" Ghazi Hamad, a member of the Hamas politburo, told Beirut's LBCI Lebanon News TV station in an interview that aired Oct. 24. \"We are called a nation of martyrs, and we are proud to sacrifice martyrs.\"\nThe impact of this narrative could have consequences for how the war plays out eventually and the international pressure on Israel, Boot told ABC News.\n\"Israel doesn't want to alienate the Western world,\" Boot said. \"I think this is something Hamas understands. I think Hamas has made a judgment that creating more Palestinian casualties will lead to its own benefit.\"\nBen Jensen, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington, D.C., said it's important for the public to use a skeptical eye when taking a close look at all the aspects that go into shaping a narrative of the war on both sides -- including social media posts, the videos and the press conferences.\n\"Take a close look at those emotionally laden stories. You can't just accept it, you should ask, is that really true? What's the other side? What is their perspective?\" said Jensen, who authored the book \"Information at War: Military Innovation, Battle Networks, and the Future of Artificial Intelligence.\"\n\"It's important that we do it because if we don't do it soon, we are literally going to be tearing ourselves apart jacked up on emotion. TikTok is the ultimate emotional drug,\" Jensen added."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 51, "end": 163}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 166, "end": 895}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 949, "end": 1122}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1287, "end": 1339}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 1389, "end": 1448}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1592, "end": 1610}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1612, "end": 2193}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2438, "end": 2622}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2568, "end": 2622}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2913, "end": 2931}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2933, "end": 3049}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 3052, "end": 3126}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 3193, "end": 3324}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 3919, "end": 4035}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4275, "end": 4295}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 4405, "end": 4611}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 4406, "end": 4511}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4500, "end": 4511}], "article_id": "42145", "lang": "en", "text": "Covid surges dim hopes for speedy end to pandemic\n\nThe outbreak shows no signs of abating, with nearly 1.9 million known to have died worldwide and 87 million cases\n\nThe United States reported a daily record of Covid-19 deaths and Brazil’s toll passed the bleak milestone of 200,000 Thursday as new surges of the coronavirus dimmed hopes for respite from the pandemic anytime soon.\nSharp rises in cases around the world have led authorities to impose a slew of new lockdowns and other restrictions, even as dozens of countries roll out the first stages of the vaccination campaigns hailed as the light at the end of the tunnel.\nChina has imposed emergency measures to tackle an outbreak in the northern city of Shijiazhuang, while Tokyo began a month-long state of emergency Friday, calling on businesses in the Japanese capital to stop serving alcohol by 7pm and residents to stay home after 8pm.\nCanada and Lebanon have ordered nighttime curfews, while the World Health Organization warned that European nations need to ramp up efforts to deal with a new, more contagious strain of the virus that first emerged in England.\nThe plight of countries struggling to control the virus matters beyond their borders, said the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.\n“The fact is that no one is safe until we are all safe,” it said.\n“The nature of this virus means that the world can only be as strong as the weakest health system.”\nThe global outbreak shows no signs of abating, with nearly 1.9 million people known to have died worldwide and 87 million confirmed cases.\n\nHorror show sequel?\nThe numbers continued to pile up at an alarming rate in the United States, the country with the world’s highest death toll, at more than 360,000.\nThe US registered a record 3,998 deaths over the past 24 hours, according to Johns Hopkins University.\nBrazil, the country with the second-highest toll, meanwhile reported its second-highest number of daily deaths – 1,524 – on its way to passing the mark of 200,000 people killed by the virus.\nThe situation stands to get a lot worse in Brazil before it gets better, warned Paulo Lotufo, an epidemiologist at the University of Sao Paulo.\n“I don’t even know how we’re going to get through January,” he said.\n“A lot of health workers are exhausted. People have had to deal with a huge amount of suffering.”\nBrazil is now seeing uncomfortable reminders of the pandemic’s worst days.\nIn the Amazon rainforest city of Manaus, the health system is again being pushed to the brink, echoing haunting scenes last April of mass graves and corpses piled in refrigerator trucks.\nAs the authorities deployed refrigerator trucks a second time, a court on Saturday ordered the state government to shut non-essential businesses for 15 days.\nCalifornia has also deployed 166 refrigerated trailers to be used as temporary morgues by overwhelmed hospitals, officials said.\n\nFar-ranging fallout\nThe pandemic crushed economic growth last year, and France’s finance minister warned that the worst was still to come.\n“There will be more bankruptcies in 2021 than in 2020,” said Bruno Le Maire.\nThe minister in charge of Japan’s pandemic response, meanwhile, warned that Tokyo’s medical system was “stretched thin,” a major worry for a city gearing up to host the Olympic Games in the summer.\nThe Australian city of Brisbane called a snap three-day lockdown after a worker at a quarantine hotel contracted the highly infectious British strain of Covid-19.\nIn China, authorities have moved swiftly to contain a new cluster of cases in Shijiazhuang, in northern Hebei province, closing schools, cutting travel links and implementing mass testing.\nEngland, meanwhile, announced it would introduce mandatory coronavirus testing for all international arrivals starting early next week.\n\nUK strain hits France\nFrance said it had confirmed 10 cases of the mutant British coronavirus strain – a worrying development which means the more infectious strain could already be circulating more widely in the country.\nRestrictions at the British border – blocking most people from entering France, including tourists – will nonetheless be kept in force “until further notice” in a bid to stop the new strain taking hold, said Prime Minister Jean Castex.\n\n‘Catastrophic’ impact\nBritain began its third lockdown on Wednesday despite being praised for a relatively rapid vaccine rollout.\n“Unless we take the lockdown seriously the impact on healthcare for the whole country could be catastrophic,” said Rupert Pearse, a professor of intensive care medicine who works at the Royal London Hospital.\nThe surge in British cases has not left elite sport untouched, with Aston Villa becoming the fourth Premier League football club to confirm an outbreak.\nThose infections add to growing worries about whether English football’s top-flight can complete the season on schedule, with 40 players across the league testing positive last week and three matches already postponed."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Doubt", "start": 103, "end": 173},

'Covid' Death Toll Numbers In America And In China - MSM Finally Admits So Called Covid Deaths Could Actually Be Covid 'Vaccine-Related' Deaths\n\nOnce in a while we can garner some truths from the MSM in America. Of course we have to hunt, mix and match their propaganda up, and then hunt some more before putting the pieces of the puzzle together. Even then their biases, and willingness to twist themselves into pretzels to fit the preferred narrative is easily seen....at least by those with their eyes open.\nFrankly it is sometimes easier to list their lies than to find truth in their reporting, if it doesn't fit the official narrative.\nIn this article we will be discussing some very strange covid vaccine-related information we have found in our search for truth.\nWhile China revises the death toll numbers upward by tens of thousands, American media now admits that we have been overcounting covid deaths in the U.S.\nAt the center of everything are covid vaccines and boosters.\n\nCOVID DEATHS THAT WEREN'T.....\nMore than two years after Independent Media, including ANP, reported that not all counted covid deaths were from covid, and they were just being listed as covid deaths, the MSM discovers that not all counted covid deaths were from covid.\nThe first report we will cite was written on January 13, 2023, by Washington Post contributor Leana S. Wen.\nI'll ask readers to remember that name because we will be discussing her previous assertions more a little further down.\nThe title of the opinion piece by Ms. Wen, is \"We are overcounting covid deaths and hospitalizations. That’s a problem.\"\nYa think?\nHere are some key paragraphs for readers to consider:\n• Two infectious-disease experts I spoke with believe that the number of deaths attributed to covid is far greater than the actual number of people dying from covid. Robin Dretler, an attending physician at Emory Decatur Hospital and the former president of Georgia’s chapter of Infectious Diseases Society of America, estimates that at his hospital, 90 percent of patients diagnosed with covid are actually in the hospital for some other illness.\n• Dretler also sees patients with multiple concurrent infections. “People who have very low white blood cell counts from chemotherapy might be admitted because of bacterial pneumonia or foot gangrene. They may also have covid, but covid is not the main reason why they’re so sick.”\n• If these patients die, covid might get added to their death certificate along with the other diagnoses. But the coronavirus was not the primary contributor to their death and often played no role at all.\nSo, it is quite possible that up to 90 percent of listed covid deaths weren't actually deaths from covid.\n\nCHINA REVISES 'COVID' DEATHS UPWARD BY 59,000+\nWe'll get back to Ms. Wen, in detail, after discussing the news coming out of China, where there is a \"alleged\" new strain of covid.\nI have literally lost count of how many alleged \"new strains\" we have seen reported, but that is for another article.\nChina list 37 deaths from between Dec. 7 and Jan. 8. By January 15, that number had been revised upward to 60,000.\nChina on Saturday made a significant revision of its official death toll in the latest outbreak of the coronavirus — to nearly 60,000 deaths linked to covid-19 since December, when pandemic restrictions were lifted and infections surged across the country, up from just 37.\nThe announcement follows criticism by international health experts and complaints by citizens that the government has been understating the number of deaths caused by the virus.\nAuthorities have recently come under added scrutiny following reports of overwhelmed funeral homes and hospitals. A report by The Washington Post last week documented a surge in traffic outside funeral homes, according to satellite imagery, firsthand videos and interviews with crematorium staff and residents.\nChina was undercounting them while America was overcounting them? As I said earlier, strange.\nThe strangeness doesn't end there though.\n\nCOVID DEATHS OR COVID VACCINE DEATHS?\nWe have all seen the constant stream of \"died suddenly\" stories since the vaccine rollout in 2021, just as we have seen the nonstop MSM stories of covid pandemic of the \"unvaccinated.\"\nThat too was a theme of propaganda for liberal media outlets, right up until they finally quietly admitted that it the vaccinated that are dying in larger numbers than the unvaccinated, or the \"purebloods\" as they have been dubbed.\nNovember, Wapo again: \"Vaccinated people now make up a majority of covid deaths\"\nThey begin with \"It’s no longer a pandemic of the unvaccinated.\"\nNewsflash: It never was.\nMake no mistake, they are still pushing people to get vaxxed in that piece, because they are still blaming covid for those deaths.\nNow rather than using my bias against the covid vaccines due their ultra fast rollout with no time to test for detrimental long term effects, we'll let a couple other headlines make this next point.\nOmicron subvariant XBB.1.5 possibly more likely to infect those who are vaccinated, officials say\nAre Vaccines Fueling New Covid Variants?\nThe \"official narrative\" claims differently but the fact that so-called covid deaths are now higher in vaccinated people than alleged covid deaths for unvaccinated people, pretty much negates the denials.\nIf the vaccinated are more likely to catch and die from covid that purebloods, does that not make those death covid vaccine-related rather than covid deaths? Without the vaccine those people may have not caught covid, therefore may not have died.\nBack to Ms. Wen. In July 2021, Stefan Stanford highlighted Leana Wen, who is also a CNN talking head, who declared that \"Life Needs To Be Hard For Unvaccinated Americans.\"\nAnd while ANP has emailed Dr. Wen at the email address listed on this linked webpage, asking her what her ties are to Communist China since she's pushing full-scale medical tyranny, we're not surprised that Dr. Wen has not gotten back to us. Though as Slavo pointed out in his story, Wen is quite unhappy that unvaccinated people can 'go about their lives as normal without any consequence'. Yes, how absolutely horrifying that free Americans are 'allowed' to be free! Though as we've pointed out time and time again on ANP, free people don't get their rights from government but God. Dr. Wen should go to China if she doesn't like it here in America.\nStefan does have a way with words!\nOn December 25, in an ANP article by Joel S Hirschhorn of the Pandemic Blunder Newsletter, we see Ms. Wen backpedaled previous calls for medical tyranny, and admitted that immunity is far more effective against covid than vaccines.\nOne of many liberals who showed their true totalitarian faces by suggesting those who were unvaccinated need to lose rights and privileges, with moves being made by the totalitarian left to accomplish that to this very day, Dr. Wen just made a HUGE 'about face' on those earlier remarks in a recent Washington Post article (saved at wayback machine), dropping this bombshell upon herself and all of those still pushing for 'vaccine passports' by reporting on numerous new studies showing the vaccinated are MUCH LESS protected from COVID than the unvaccinated who have already had COVID. A little bit late, Dr. Wen.\n\nA CONNECTION BETWEEN VACCINES AND ALLEGED 'COVID' DEATHS?\nLooking back to China now, we see a report from January 13, 2023, explaining that China is the global leader of vaccine support.\nCities in China also mandates vaccines, via CNN:\nBeijing on Wednesday announced a Covid-19 vaccine mandate for residents to enter public venues, becoming the first city in mainland China to do so as it attempts to contain a highly infectious Omicron subvariant.\nFrom July 11, people will need to show proof of vaccination to enter a wide range of public places in the Chinese capital, including cinemas, libraries, museums, gyms, stadiums and training centers, a city health official told a news briefing Wednesday.\nPeople who are “not suitable” for vaccination will be exempted from the requirement, the official added, without clarifying how they can provide proof for exemption.\nWuhan, China is where covid originated, and the Chinese have their own vaccines.\nThis begs the question of how many of China's recent 60,000 deaths from \"covid\", revised upwards from 37, were vaccinated individuals?\nAnother question to be asked, considering America has been overcounting covid deaths, how many of the ones not matching the \"overcounted\" criteria, were vaccinated?\n\nBOTTOM LINE\nNot only are we seeing an unprecedented amount of \"sudden\" deaths, especially of the young and athletes, but we also have no idea how many so-called \"covid\" deaths are really from people that caught covid because their immune system was compromised by the covid vaccines and boosters."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 112, "end": 284}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 236, "end": 260}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 348, "end": 380}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 401, "end": 526}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1114, "end": 1297}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1409, "end": 1559}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 1562, "end": 1742}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1566, "end": 1578}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 1745, "end": 1838}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1822, "end": 1838}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3620, "end": 3962}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3965, "end": 4116}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 3980, "end": 4001}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4034, "end": 4045}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4464, "end": 4552}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4788, "end": 4876}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 5370, "end": 5616}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5576, "end": 5582}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 5747, "end": 5995}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5763, "end": 5795}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5846, "end": 5866}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 5998, "end": 6115}], "article_id": "42149", "lang": "en", "text": "Federal District Court Could Rule Against Abortion-inducing Medications\n\nAnother Likely Supreme Court Showdown\n\nAny day now, a federal District Court judge in Texas could wipe out the use of abortion-inducing medications, the result of yet another legal assault by anti-abortion forces.\nFinal arguments in a lawsuit brought by a small coalition of anti-abortion lawyers and doctors were due on Friday in a case that questions whether the Federal Drug Administration did enough testing before authorizing the use of mifepristone, one of two drugs used in a medication abortion, in the year 2000.\nIn practical terms, most abortions in the United States are by medication. The outcome of this case could force the FDA to have to withdraw use of the medication approvals even from states that now have moved to enshrine abortion rights after last year’s Supreme Court decision overthrowing Roe v. Wade.\nSince then, of course, millions have used the drugs safely.\nFrom all accounts of the lawsuit, the case is unique for attacking the medical procedures involved in testing — and in the filing of the suit in Amarillo, where U.S. District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, nominated by Donald Trump and confirmed by Republican senators, is known for his conservative views on same-sex marriage and abortion. Indeed, any appeal of an opinion would then proceed to the conservative Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.\nUndoubtedly, this will end up once again before a U.S. Supreme Court lineup turned antagonistic about finding legal reasoning to retain abortion rights.\nThe abortion wars are far from over, and advocates for women, women’s health and decision making in abortion are geared up for a street fight now over the science of the medications. In a word, they find the arguments of the lawsuit baseless and reflecting of “fringe” theories.\nBut even a temporary injunction from this judge to take effect while other courts consider the arguments might require the FDA to stop sales with immediate effect nationwide.\n\nThe Drugs and the Case\nAt the heart of this case are the drugs and medical procedures and not the law or the Constitutional questions about privacy provisions underwriting perceived rights to abortion, which has been the basis of previous legal challenges.\nSince 2000, when the FDA okayed these medications, a patient first takes one pill of mifepristone, which terminates the pregnancy. Approximately 24 hours later, they typically take a four-pill dose of misoprostol, a drug first introduced in 1973 to treat stomach ulcers, to soften the cervix and prompt contractions that expel the fetus.\nMifepristone, which blocks a hormone necessary for pregnancy development, is authorized through 10 weeks of pregnancy, although many clinics and telemedicine providers have begun offering it up to 12 or 13 weeks into pregnancy. The second drug, misoprostol, has never been as tightly restricted as mifepristone and is used for many different medical conditions.\nThis suit aims to undo the approval of mifepristone. Just last month, the FDA updated its rules to allow brick-and-mortar pharmacies to dispense mifepristone — expanding access to the drug unless state law restricts it. These pills had been obtainable through the mail if health providers were certified and patients completed a consent form.\nAlliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal group that has been involved in anti-abortion litigation, filed the suit in November on behalf of four anti-abortion medical organizations and four doctors who say they have treated patients with the drug.\nOn its website, the Alliance outlines the case: The FDA illegally failed to protect health, safety and welfare of girls and women because it never studied the safety of the drugs under the labeled conditions of use, ignored potential impact on developing bodies of adolescents, disregarded evidence that chemical abortion drugs cause more complications than surgical abortions and eliminated.\nThe FDA “chose politics over science” by characterizing pregnancy as “an illness” and arguing that these drugs provide “a meaningful therapeutic benefit,” says the lawsuit, which is called Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “Pregnancy is not an illness, and chemical abortion drugs don’t provide a therapeutic benefit—they end a baby’s life, and they pose serious and life-threatening complications to the mother,” the website argues.\n\nThe National Implications\nThe suit has been ridiculed by legal experts as rooted in baseless and debunked arguments. But abortion rights advocates are concerned – and now have appealed to the Biden administration to take seriously – the prospects that the path of conservative courts could produce a verdict that will impose restrictions nationwide.\nApparently, some in Congress who favor abortion rights have had a hard time understanding that this could affect even states where abortion has been re-certified as legal. In the Justice Department, there is a reproductive rights task force to seek legal avenues to protect access to abortion pills. In January, that group re-issued rules saying that the U.S. Postal Service may deliver abortion pills to people in states that have sharply restricted the procedure. Now they are looking at this Texas case, arguing that it is the FDA and not states that decide on the use of drugs.\nPresumably, if there is a strong opinion barring the use of mifepristone, or any abortion-inducing medications, the lines for surgical abortions in states where that is allowed will swell further, creating burdens for patients and health providers. Other clinics might opt to use just misoprostol pills instead of the standard regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol together.\nThe adoption by Republican-led state legislatures to enact total abortion bans has made this issue identifiably partisan and we have seen the backlash of abortion politics roil what had been expected to bigger Republican election victory in November.\nWith presidential politics for 2024 getting underway, we can be sure the abortion issue is not going away anytime soon."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 0, "end": 19}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 0, "end": 52}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 55, "end": 261}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 264, "end": 678}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 399, "end": 422}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 424, "end": 435}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 545, "end": 568}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 681, "end": 803}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 806, "end": 897}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1047, "end": 1078}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1081, "end": 1314}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1148, "end": 1184}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1231, "end": 1259}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 1317, "end": 1574}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1339, "end": 1350}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 1577, "end": 1741}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1637, "end": 1653}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1898, "end": 1907}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1930, "end": 2034}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 2510, "end": 2684}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2590, "end": 2603}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2685, "end": 2902}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2891, "end": 2902}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2994, "end": 3430}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3573, "end": 3917}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 3920, "end": 3950}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 4029, "end": 4472}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 4151, "end": 4161}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 4278, "end": 4292}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4492, "end": 4518}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 4520, "end": 4721}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 4520, "end": 4523}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 4724, "end": 4892}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4762, "end": 4781}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4997, "end": 5004}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 5174, "end": 5235}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 5238, "end": 5622}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5345, "end": 5361}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5451, "end": 5463}], "article_id": "4215", "lang": "en", "text": "Progressive/Leftists Target Black Women for Abortions\n\nThe U.S. SCOTUS ruling correcting federal law by returning the issue of abortion back to the states has prompted Black women to become a focal point as leverage for leftist/progressive actions and agitations.\nIf Black women confirmed the KKK wanted them to abort their babies, they'd double down on having as many babies as possible in revolt. If Black women confirmed evil racists wanted to exterminate their race via targeting them for abortion, they would reject and denounce abortions. If Black women confirmed abortion was specifically concocted to enshrine and uphold \"White Supremacy,\" they would reject it altogether. It's time to tell Black women historical facts and truth instead of purposeful attempts to use and manipulate them for evil.\nGenerally speaking, Black women are strong, determined, and loyal to causes they deem worthy. While these attributes can also characterize many other demographics, Black women are viewed and targeted as a significant monolith segment within the leftist/progressive universe. And since they make up a substantial percentage of their audience, contrived manipulation and deceptions are continuously targeted toward this group. The most grotesque deceptions used to manipulate this group are purposeful omissions.\nThere is a reason why Progressives omit the fact that the Founder of Planned Parenthood (Margret Sanger) was a frequent speaker and contributor to the women's Ku Klux Klan (KKK), and started her clinics to \"exterminate the negro population\" (her exact words). If Black girls had been learning this as a great example of \"systemic racism\" in school over the decades (since Roe), Black women would utterly reject abortion today. From the Leftist/Progressive point of view, this omission is necessary for the continued use and manipulation of Black women on abortion. The omission is weaponized against black women.\nThere is a reason why progressives omit the disproportionate targeting of Black communities for abortions. Suppose Black women realized that up to 90% of the strategic placement of \"abortuaries\" (\"abortion clinics\") are within walking distance of Black communities. In comparison, Blacks only make up 13% of the population and child-bearing aged Black women only approx. 3.5%. Strategic targeting of Black preborn babies' lives (via abortion) translates to the fact that (even with significant demographic and population differences) up to 40+% of all abortions are Black babies! If Black women were apprised of these facts, they would see this as what it is… hateful racist targeting of the Black community! They would almost universally reject abortions. From the Leftist/Progressive point of view, omitting facts about targeting Black communities with abortion is necessary for the continued manipulation of Black women. The tactic of omission is a tool for brainwashing.\nThere is a reason why progressives omit the fact that abortion is borne out of eugenics. Eugenics means \"well-born,\" and its founders, Charles Darwin and his first cousin Francis Galton, were racists determined to protect the supremacy of the White/Aryan race (whom they deemed \"well-born\"). They concocted eugenics as a scheme to provide \"scientific justification\" for the extermination of other ethnicities; they didn't want any other races to taint their \"pure\" Caucasian gene pool. These facts are notable and inconvenient. Black women would detest this motive and scheme of \"White supremacy\" if they knew and would reject abortions, so Leftist/Progressives omit!\nAll told, leftist/progressives' ultimate desire is to omit facts about abortion to continue perpetuating manipulation and disempowerment of Black women. Since Black women are an influential segment of their political and activist base, there's a need to keep them trapped in false narratives and focused on race agitation against White Supremacy.\nEvery Black Life Matters (EBLM) stands against all racism and White Supremacy wherever it exists. That said, we call out the reprobation of teachers for purposely omitting confirmed racist/White Supremacist machinations of Darwin. We call out leftist/progressives for purposely omitting the truth about the racism of abortion and its pioneer Margret Sanger. We call out all politicians who, knowing its eugenicist roots, still firmly support and embrace abortion. All these factions are definitively against Black life and the well-being of Black women! \"We see you,\" and we denounce and reject you!\nEBLM embraces the dignity of life and, by providing historical facts and truth, demands dignity and respect for every woman (especially Black women, since they're specifically targeted for manipulation). Will you stand with us as we confront abusive manipulators and help ensure Black women are no longer used as mere \"Progressive tools\" to help leftist/progressive causes? The facts confirm that all those who knowingly support abortion and its racist history are themselves, racists! From the highest authority (the White House) to political parties and individual politicians, educators, media/entertainment personalities, to community organizations, all who support the racism of abortion must be held to account.\nIt's a binary choice! Renounce and denounce the racism and White Supremacy of abortion, or embrace it with full racist vigor. Either way, stop continued deceptions directed at Black women to perpetuate support of racist causes that undermine and are antithetical to the morals and values of our community.

If so, why?\nTo most ears, the question sounds blasphemous, which illustrates the rottenness of our immigration debate. Actually, “debate” is far too generous. One side has made sure that there is no debate. Good people want more immigration, and bad people object or raise questions. An inherently political issue has been effectively rendered religious, with the righteous on one side, sinners on the other.\nThe basic question remains. The pat answer over the past 20 years — “to do the jobs Americans just won’t do” — may seem to have some salience with a 3.9 percent unemployment rate. But that only further raises the question. After at least two decades of wage stagnation and even decline, now that we’ve finally reached the nirvana of full employment (and who knows how long it will last), why not take advantage of this tight labor market to raise wages across the board? Especially for the working and middle classes that got nowhere or even lost ground during the housing, finance and tech booms of recent years?\nJust about everyone knows the answer: because the business community does not like tight labor markets and the concomitant necessity to raise wages. That’s bad for the bottom line. The solution? More workers! And so the Chamber of Commerce annex — a.k.a. Capitol Hill Republicans — dutifully attempt to do their donors’ bidding at the expense of their voters’ interests.\nCritics of the Trump immigration policy that leads to separating families say it is “un-American.” They’re wrong.  (Kate Woodsome, Adriana Usero/The Washington Post)\nEconomists in league with big business got good at torturing data to “show” that immigration benefits the economy. But as demonstrated by Harvard University’s George Borjas, one of the nation’s leading economists on the topic, immigration is a net economic benefit to immigrants and to their employers. To workers already here, not so much.\nNo matter, because the Democrats are no longer the party of labor. Back when they were — in the prelapsarian Clinton years — they sought tight labor markets precisely for their efficacy in boosting lower-end wages. But today’s Democrats are the party of high class, high tech and high capital.\nThis glamour coalition is not big enough by itself to win elections. So the left has hoodwinked some (but, as the 2016 election shows, by no means all) low-income voters into thinking that their interests align with those of Wall Street and Silicon Valley oligarchs.\nIt’s clear what the oligarchs get out of an endless influx of cheap labor. What the Democratic Party gets is also clear: more voters, and with them the tantalizing possibility of turning the country as irreversibly blue as Democratic policies have already done to New York, California and many other states.\nDemocrats used to be coy about this. The 2002 blockbuster “The Emerging Democratic Majority,” by John B. Judis, presented demographic change as an inevitability, not a deliberate plot to rig elections. But now, for the first time facing real pushback from those whose interests more immigration does not serve, the left is more open in exhorting their side and demonizing the other. Hence this year’s “How Democracies Die,” by Steven Levitsky, states openly that immigration favors Democrats, so the more the better. It also construes any opposition as (of course) racist.\nAnother argument for more people is to point to falling birthrates among the native-born. In fact, the United States remains near the top of birthrates in the developed world. Regardless, consider that immigration not only lowers wages but also raises housing prices by increasing demand and stresses public schools by adding non-English-speaking students. And as such factors worsen, research suggests that people are putting off marriage — which reduces birthrates.\nRelated is the claim that more people are necessary to solve our looming entitlement crisis. This quickly falls apart once you think it through. In 1967, future Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson favorably compared Social Security to a Ponzi scheme, arguing that it will be sustainable because younger people will always outnumber retirees. But does anyone really believe the United States — or any country — is capable of sustaining population growth without end? Somehow, the United States needs to find a way to meet its fiscal commitments without stuffing the land beyond the bursting point.\nSo again: Why do we need more people?

torture of civilians in detention through beatings, electrocution, and mock executions; rape; and, alongside other Russian officials, have deported hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian civilians to Russia, including children who have been forcibly separated from their families”.\nAlso appearing at the Munich Security Conference — which was convened to tackle the issue of Europe’s deadliest military conflict since World War II — was the new UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, who told the conference that holding Russia to account for its actions would be a part of “winning the peace”.\n“We must see justice through the [international criminal court] for their sickening war crimes committed, whether in Bucha, Irpin, Mariupol or beyond,” Sunak said, adding that the “treaties and agreements of the post-cold war era have failed Ukraine”.\nThe White House is said to be prepared to support any prosecutions or investigations as may be mandated by the United Nations.\nThus far, the UN’s Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine has not yet concluded that the war crimes it says it has identified amount to “crimes against humanity.”"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 0, "end": 55}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 172, "end": 178}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 202, "end": 335}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 338, "end": 410}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 412, "end": 563}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 415, "end": 423}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 645, "end": 720}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 685, "end": 720}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 723, "end": 837}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 783, "end": 803}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 950, "end": 1408}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 950, "end": 974}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1156, "end": 1167}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1702, "end": 1856}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 2526, "end": 2810}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2813, "end": 2892}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2821, "end": 2853}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2985, "end": 2991}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 3086, "end": 3212}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 3215, "end": 3437}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3440, "end": 3489}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3448, "end": 3452}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3648, "end": 3886}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 3889, "end": 3965}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3940, "end": 3960}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3968, "end": 4021}], "article_id": "42153", "lang": "en", "text": "The Beginning of a Frightening New Era in North Carolina\n\nI’ve always been intentional about distinguishing myself as “from New Orleans” rather than “from Louisiana.” I am ashamed to be from Louisiana, a state that has passed one of the strictest abortion bans in the nation. A ban that doesn’t even allow exceptions for rape and incest.\nNow I can’t help but wonder, is this the trajectory North Carolina is on? It terrifies me to think SB20, which goes into effect on July 1st, is only the beginning, as many of our Republican legislators have touted victoriously. We’ve seen the bans pass in other states, and the consequences have been dire. The manner in which SB20 was passed was absolutely shameful and undemocratic. If Republicans are willing to resort to these deceitful and Machiavellian tactics, what is next for North Carolina?\nAt 33 years of age, I’m well into the stage of life in which friends are starting or expanding their families. Thanks to bills like SB20, however, when a friend shares news of a pregnancy, my heart sinks, even if this is happy news for my friends. Terror is the first feeling I experience now. Not joy. Not surprise. Sheer terror. It’s frightening for me, and I’m only the recipient of the news. It’s even more anxiety provoking for my pregnant friends who are afraid that something will go wrong, and they won’t receive the reproductive healthcare they need and deserve.\nFor many, pregnancy is a joyous and exciting time. No one wants to think that something may go wrong with their pregnancy. Before SB20, pregnant patients at least had the security and peace of mind in knowing that medical professionals were available to provide them with treatment options.\nNow, however, their joy and excitement might be tempered with fear and anxiety that if a medical complication arises, they might not get the care they need. In the year since the Dobbs decision came down, we have heard so many stories, often directly from patients themselves on social media, sharing their experiences of being denied care until it was nearly too late. We’ve heard the stories of patients being forced to carry non-viable pregnancies. Anyone who has watched the news in the past year has likely heard these stories coming out of Texas, Missouri, Nebraska, my home state, Louisiana, and all of the other states with total or severe abortion bans.\nNorth Carolina had the opportunity to continue to be a safe haven for patients and providers across the entire south who were being denied care due to politics. Had we expanded reproductive healthcare access in North Carolina, we could’ve created more practices that offer reproductive healthcare, attracted the best healthcare providers, and served patients across the south who needed abortion and comprehensive reproductive healthcare services.\nBut our Republican-controlled legislature closed the door to these opportunities: to codifying Roe v. Wade, to attracting the best doctors in the nation, to addressing our abysmal maternal mortality rates, and to expanding our healthcare system, especially in rural areas. Our legislature has endangered patients, particularly those who already struggle to access any kind of healthcare and providers.\nEthically treating patients, according to best medical practices, means that providers will potentially have to decide if they want to risk the license and livelihood they worked so hard to achieve to stay in North Carolina. SB20 is cruel and will hurt patients and providers.\nWhen Roe was overturned a year ago, I told my friends and family in New Orleans, and along the Gulf Coast, that they were always welcome in North Carolina. But when the Republicans voted to override Governor Cooper’s veto on SB20, they made it clear that those who care about pregnant patients and those who believe in our rights to control our own bodies and lives don’t count in North Carolina. Women and people who can get pregnant are de facto second-class citizens here.\nThis is not a state that I’m proud to call home either."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 0, "end": 69}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 72, "end": 79}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 81, "end": 179}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 90, "end": 101}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 120, "end": 125}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 161, "end": 280}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 161, "end": 172}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 417, "end": 443}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 620, "end": 752}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1326, "end": 1426}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1736, "end": 1761}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1832, "end": 1858}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1900, "end": 2057}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1915, "end": 1932}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2194, "end": 2257}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2352, "end": 2397}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2474, "end": 2505}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2527, "end": 2538}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 2551, "end": 2554}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2589, "end": 2604}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2647, "end": 2714}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2688, "end": 2697}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2736, "end": 2741}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2776, "end": 2939}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2841, "end": 2851}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 2942, "end": 2996}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 3002, "end": 3029}], "article_id": "42154", "lang": "en", "text": "New Study Blames Blue State Exodus On Climate Change, Not Dem Policies\n\nFar-left Axios is gushing over a new study that blames climate change for people fleeing Democrat-run cities like the “metro areas of Minneapolis, Milwaukee and Washington, D.C. (specifically, Alexandria, Va.).”\n“Climate migration is already taking place within American communities, new data finds, as people flee flood-prone areas, and create ‘climate abandonment’ zones,” writes an unquestioning Axios. [emphasis, links added]\n“The study constitutes the latest warning sign of the effects of climate change,” Axios continues without skepticism. “Population shifts, and a larger reckoning for real estate, are only expected to worsen as global average surface temperatures rise.”\nBut then the premise of the study undercuts itself in a big way with the admission that “Americans are leaving the Rust Belt in droves and heading to areas of greater climate risk in the South and Southwest[.]”\nWhat’s more, “cities with high flood risks, like Miami and Houston, are still pulling in more people than they are losing,” the study admits. “But these areas are growing more slowly than they would be if flooding weren’t such a threat, the study shows.”\nA good faith reading of the study tells me that the conclusions come from projections and math equations. Nowhere does it say that the actual people who moved were surveyed or questioned about why they moved.\nThe study also uses a math problem to explain away “local political, social, and economic conditions” — but you have to talk to people to understand their motive for moving.\nAdditionally, as stated above, the study admits that most of the country’s migration is to areas that are “of greater climate risk.”\nThe study fails to mention that real estate on the coasts, the areas that would be most at risk if climate change were real is increasing in value, not decreasing.\nIf you recall, Mr. Climate Change himself, Barack Obama, spent millions on a mansion just a few feet from the same ocean that’s supposed to wipe out the coast.\nThe Climate Change Channel, CNN, moved its headquarters from the safe, inland city of Atlanta to the edge of the water in Manhattan — the same Manhattan the “experts” told us would be flooded by now.\nSo let me tell you what I think is happening here. Granted, this is only one man’s opinion. We’re still allowed to have opinions, correct?\nOkay, so one of the most devastating facts in the political world today is Americans voting with their feet.\nPeople are fleeing Democrat-run cities for MAGA Country.\nAnd it’s not because of impending danger from some unicorn called climate change; it’s because Democrat Party policies are disastrous when implemented. Ahh, but…\n…If that exodus can be blamed on climate change, Democrats are not only no longer on defense when it comes to the devastating truth about population loss, but they can spin it around into a talking point they love: People are leaving our cities because of climate change and here’s why we need socialism.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 0, "end": 80}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 56, "end": 80}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 83, "end": 195}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 84, "end": 125}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 248, "end": 256}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 562, "end": 592}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 600, "end": 613}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 654, "end": 698}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 867, "end": 917}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1058, "end": 1100}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 1102, "end": 1380}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 1383, "end": 1500}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1526, "end": 1532}], "article_id": "42155", "lang": "en", "text": "Senate border security talks grind on as Trump invokes 'blood-poisoning' rhetoric\n\n'They’re poisoning the blood of our country,' said Republican presidential candidate, former U.S. President Trump\n\nTime slipping, White House and Senate negotiators struggled Sunday to reach a U.S. border security deal that would unlock President Joe Biden’s request for billions of dollars worth of military aid for Israel and Ukraine before senators leave town for the holiday recess.\nThe talks come as Donald Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner in 2024, delivered alarming anti-immigrant remarks about \"blood\" purity at a political rally over the weekend.\n\"They’re poisoning the blood of our country,\" Trump said about the record numbers of immigrants coming to the U.S. without immediate legal status.

But a lot of Christians do. They talk about a biblical worldview this, a Bible-based decision that. Typically, in America, Biblical means right-wing; you stand for “traditional” marriages and against abortions.\nBut what if I told you that the Bible not only condones abortion, it gives a recipe for how to perform one? Would you be surprised?\nWell, some of you wouldn’t. I’m sure you’re aware of the story from Numbers 5. For those who aren’t, here’s verses 19 through 22: Then the priest shall make her take an oath, saying, “If no man has lain with you, if you have not turned aside to uncleanness while under your husband’s authority, be immune to this water of bitterness that brings the curse. But if you have gone astray while under your husband’s authority, if you have defiled yourself and some man other than your husband has had intercourse with you,” —let the priest make the woman take the oath of the curse and say to the woman—“the Lord make you an execration and an oath among your people, when the Lord makes your uterus drop, your womb discharge; now may this water that brings the curse enter your bowels and make your womb discharge, your uterus drop!” And the woman shall say, “Amen. Amen.”\nThat’s a lengthy way to say that if a woman cheats on her husband and gets pregnant, the priest is to perform an abortion by having her drink “bitter water.”\nAmen. Amen.\nBut again, because I don’t turn to the Bible to determine what is right and good, I’m not suggesting this is the best way to go about performing abortions. It’s a highly patriarchal and sexist practice, if taken at face value. The point, then, is simply this: If you have a literalist approach to the Bible, you can’t avoid this passage. You have to take it head on. If you’re anti-abortion and pro-“Word of God,” then you can’t skirt this issue forever.\nNow, obviously that’s exactly what most Christians will do; they will avoid this passage at all costs. You won’t hear many sermons on Numbers 5, not many sermons entitled “Here’s How The Word of God Says We Should Abort Fetuses.” But that’s the thing about so many Christians in America; they have a pick-and-choose approach to the Bible. To put it this way: They cherry-pick the Bible when it’s suitable for them.\nOf course, cherry-picking is fine. I admit that much in many places. The question, then, is this: HOW are we going to cherry-pick? Are we going to pick the cherries that point us toward love, inclusion, acceptance, mercy, tolerance, patience, kindness, and social justice? Or, are we going to do what the fundamentalists do and pick the rotten cherries of violence, bigotry, homophobia, exclusion, wrath, and vengeance?\nThat’s what is so fascinating about the Bible. You can make it say basically whatever you want it to say. And that’s exactly why it’s not my rulebook for life, and never will be. It’s too dangerous, and has caused too much harm over the millennia.\nMaybe you see things differently, and if you do, put something in the comments. Just be kind, or I’ll make you drink some bitter water.\nAmen.

In a statement on Monday, the president said, “I have remained deeply engaged over the last few days to ensure that this deal—brokered and sustained through extensive U.S. mediation and diplomacy—can continue to deliver results.”\nIt’s very difficult to praise Biden—especially since he’s resisted calls for a cease-fire. The push for prioritizing the release of the hostages came largely through political pressure from the families of Israeli hostages, who have been far more critical of Benjamin Netanyahu’s government than Biden has ever dared to be. But politicians are geared to responding to praise. if the path to peace requires giving Biden a pat on the back,, then one must grudgingly agree compliment him for this welcome development.\nIn truth, the humanitarian pause is just about the only good news to come out of Israel/Palestine since the current hostilities started with the Hamas massacre of October 7. We can all rejoice in the release of the Israeli hostages (whose capture was a war crime) and Palestinian prisoners (who were detained in a system that violates international law).\nEven better news is that the parties involved in the negotiation are trying to build on it. \nAs CNN reports: Hamas is pushing to enact a clause in the original arrangement that would see extra days of pauses in Israeli strikes in return for the freeing of each group of 10 hostages. The Israeli cabinet has discussed the idea and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Biden in a call Sunday an extension would be welcome, his office said in a statement. And the United States and Qatar—the two critical intermediaries in the deal—are seeking to use the momentum of the pause to create a foundation for a more permanent end to the fighting that could see more hostages freed and civilians shielded in Gaza.\nIt’s now possible for the first time since October 7 to imagine a path to a better future, one where the humanitarian pause extends to a full hostage release and lasting cease-fire, which in turn creates the conditions for a negotiated settlement (including Biden’s oft-stated goal since October 7 of resuming a push for a two-state solution). This scenario remains very unlikely—but it at least seems within the realm of possibility. It’s both a goal that activists can push for and a reasonable measurement that Biden can be judged against.\nThe humanitarian pause also offers Israel and the United States an opportunity to reflect on the fact that the military strategy Israel has pursued since October 7 is completely mindless: This has been a war of retribution against the civilian population of Gaza that makes no strategic sense and offers no path to genuine security for Israel (leaving aside the immense immorality of the slaughter). Some of the most devastating criticisms of Israel’s strategy have come not from the anti-war left but from the American national security establishment in respectable and staid institutions like the Rand Corporation (a think tank that serves the Pentagon) and publications like Foreign Affairs.\nThese critiques note that the October 7 attack was a massive intelligence failure that discredited existing Israeli strategy, which had assumed that the military threat of Hamas had been contained by a mixture of Iron Dome protection and diplomatic outreach to Arab autocrats (in the process of being codified in the Abraham Accords). Netanyahu’s government assumed the Palestinian question could be safely sidelined for the indefinite future. The atrocities of October 7 demonstrated the bankruptcy of this strategy.\nActing out of shock, Netanyahu’s government then reverted to the familiar tactic of proving its deterrence capability by unleashing the full fury of Israel’s military on Gaza. This is the strategy known as “mowing the lawn.”\nRaphael S. Cohen, a director of strategy and doctrine at the Rand Corporation, offers this succinct account of “mowing the lawn”—which he calls “mowing the grass”: Palestinians, frustrated by the state of the enclave, turn to the likes of Hamas for, if nothing else, vengeance against Israel; Israel imposes restrictions such as the blockade on Gaza, citing security concerns; living conditions in Gaza deteriorate further, and discontent builds; Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and others capitalize on the discontent and attack Israel; and Israel responds by “mowing the grass”—killing the perpetrators along with some number of civilians, buying at best a few years of relative peace and fueling further long-term radicalization. And so the cycle continues ad infinitum.\nCohen adds that this strategy is based on “hubris” and has already been shown not to work: Israel’s mowing-the-grass strategy finally failed spectacularly on October 7. The Hamas attack underscored just how little control Israel has over Gaza. It was not just an intelligence failure and an operational failure but also a more sweeping strategic failure. The core premise behind Israel’s entire approach was proved catastrophically wrong in one morning.\nWriting in Foreign Affairs, Joost Hiltermann, a program director at the International Crisis Group, notes that Israel’s recent attack on Gaza has no good exit strategy. As Hiltermann observes, Israel so far has produced only a military response—to be clear, a devastating one—without a discernible endgame. In its fury and its pain, Israel has struck out not just at Hamas but at the entire Gazan population as well. It may soon find that it is not only incapable of achieving its stated goal of destroying Hamas’s military capability and governance of Gaza but will also be stuck with reoccupying Gaza and ruling directly over its newly homeless, desperate, and very angry population.\nMeanwhile, the cost of the civilian carnage in Gaza is increasingly becoming visible. The New York Times reported on Saturday, “While wartime death tolls will never be exact, experts say that even a conservative reading of the casualty figures reported from Gaza shows that the pace of death during Israel’s campaign has few precedents in this century. People are being killed in Gaza more quickly, they say, than in even the deadliest moments of U.S.-led attacks in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, which were themselves widely criticized by human rights groups.” The Times estimates that of the more than 14,000 people killed in Gaza, at least 69 percent (or 10,000 people) have been women and children. At this rate, achieving Israel’s stated goal of destroying the estimated 30,000 Hamas fighters would entail hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths—assuming that Hamas doesn’t recruit new members as a result of the killings.\nIsraeli officials, when speaking to Secretary of State Antony Blinken have compared what they are doing in Gaza to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This, to be clear, is from people trying to justify their actions.\nWriting in Foreign Affairs, Matt Duss and Nancy Okail, both at the Center for International Policy, have recommended ways the Biden administration can build on the humanitarian pause and jump-start negotiations for a two-state solution. Their suggestions are eminently sensible—but they would require a president far more willing to aggressively challenge Israel on issues like the settlements than Joe Biden has ever shown himself to be. Yet as improbable as negotiations might seem at the moment, what is the alternative?\nIsrael’s war is a humanitarian disaster and has no strategic logic behind it. America’s position in the world is sinking as a result of Biden’s “bear hug” strategy of acting as Netanyahu’s willing assistant. The humanitarian pause offers a rare chance for both Biden and Netanyahu to pull back from the brink. This is the moment more than ever for activists to ramp up the pressure—not just for a cease-fire but for a negotiated settlement.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 42, "end": 243}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 246, "end": 276}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 305, "end": 350}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 352, "end": 521}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 483, "end": 521}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 524, "end": 678}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 909, "end": 957}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1108, "end": 1212}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1239, "end": 1303}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 1326, "end": 1443}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1330, "end": 1349}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1395, "end": 1404}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1676, "end": 2109}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1821, "end": 1848}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2192, "end": 2201}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 2777, "end": 2908}], "article_id": "4222", "lang": "en", "text": "KCNA Commentary on Middle East Situation\n\nThe situation in the Middle East is getting worse to approach the threshold of a total war.\nIn Israel, an order was issued to prepare for all-round invasion and air raids on the Gaza Strip are expanding.\nThe Israeli military warmongers are openly crying out that \"they would soon see the Palestine territory.\"\nIt is the unanimous voice of the international community that the Middle East situation, which poses the danger of an all-out war, is a tragedy entirely caused by the U.S.\nAt the outbreak of the situation, the U.S. immediately committed itself to supporting Israel with aid and weapons and dispatched aircraft carriers Gerald R.

The Pentagon was forced to repeal its coronavirus mandate by a largely-GOP-backed requirement added to the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden in December. But many troops who balked at taking the shots still face uncertain futures.\nThe controversy shows how healthcare became a political football, with both the far right and some on the left objecting to mandated COVID vaccinations, mask-wearing, and other government public health responses. It also revealed how COVID disinformation spread and caught fire, stoking deepening mistrust of government among wide segments of American society.\nMore than 17,000 service members balked at taking the shots, citing safety fears linked to the vaccine’s speedy development and spurred by misinformation about messenger ribonucleic acid technology, as well as concern over fetal cell lines used in formulation and testing. The more the controversy raged in the news, the more troops asked to skip the shots, Military Times reporting found.\nWhile the Pentagon lifted the vaccine mandate as ordered, officials warned that repealing it would affect military readiness, potentially putting service members at risk of serious illness. DoD officials believe the shots worked: Not a single service member has died of COVID-19 since early 2022, when more than 98% of the active duty force had been at least partially vaccinated.\n“The Department will continue to promote and encourage COVID-19 vaccination for all Service members,” Austin wrote in the Jan. 10 memo repealing the mandate. “The Department has made COVID-19 vaccination as easy and convenient as possible, resulting in vaccines administered to over two million Service members and 96 percent of the force ― Active and Reserve ― being fully vaccinated.”\nThe now-lifted mandate’s aftermath is still playing out. Of the 17,000 service members who refused to take the vaccine, roughly half have been discharged and another thousand or so secured exemptions.\nSeparated troops are eligible to upgrade their discharges, or even come back into service if they want to. At the same time, Pentagon officials are still determining how to treat ― and possibly reprimand ― the remaining 7,000 troops who leaders say did not follow a lawful order.\nThe mandate’s end put a halt to any adverse actions against currently serving troops who had applied for exemptions, while opening the door for those involuntarily separated to apply to have their characterizations of service changed on their discharge paperwork. What it didn’t do was authorize them to automatically get their jobs back, or furnish any back pay for the time between their discharges and the mandate repeal, though some Republican lawmakers are still pushing for that legislation.\nThe Pentagon is also exploring how to handle a small number of still-serving troops who didn’t apply for waivers, but avoided dismissal during the vaccine mandate, meaning they refused a lawful order to get vaccinated.\n“It’s very important that our service members follow orders when they are lawful, and there are thousands that did not,” Gil Cisneros, the Pentagon’s personnel boss, told members of the House Armed Services Committee in February. “The services are going through a process to review those cases to make a determination what needs to be done.”\nIn addition to separating more than 8,000 troops, the services granted roughly 1,200 permanent and temporary exemptions for the vaccine, whether for administrative reasons, including religious objection, or medical concerns.\nThe number of waivers was unprecedented. In August 2021, before the Pentagon first announced its forthcoming mandate, vaccine exemptions were relatively rare, and mostly given for past allergic reactions or for temporary situations, like pregnancy or an impending separation from service.\nInvoluntary discharges for separation were even more rare, and hadn’t happened in any significant way since the early 2000s, when the widespread side effects of the anthrax vaccine prompted a groundswell of troops to refuse it.\n\nBy the numbers\nFrom late 2021 to early 2023, the military services discharged roughly 8,300 troops from the active and reserve components, most of whom received general discharges and were welcome to serve in uniform again if they got vaccinated.\nThe Air Force Department discharged a total of 834 personnel in 2022, before a July court order halted any further separations for those whose waivers had been rejected, according to data provided to Military Times.\nAs of Jan. 10, when the mandate repeal came down, the Air Force had more than 3,100 religious accommodation requests pending, with another 30 appeals waiting for department approval.\nOverall, the Air Force approved 389 religious, administrative and medical exemptions for active duty troops.\nThe Army discharged 1,881 soldiers before Jan. 10, according to service data, while granting 191 exemptions out of 10,699 requests.\nIn the end, the Navy granted 168 medical exemptions, 153 of them temporary, as well as 50 religious accommodations. Data as of Jan. 9, the day before the mandate repeal, show 1,878 sailors were discharged.\nIn general, temporary medical exemptions can include while a service member is pregnant or breastfeeding, for example, or undergoing a medical issue or treatment that might negatively react with a vaccine.\nThe Marine Corps tracks its data differently from the other services, spokesman Capt. Ryan Bruce told Military Times. The total number of waiver applications was not available, he said, but as of Jan. 5, the Corps had approved 420 administrative or medical exemptions to COVID-19 vaccination.\nThe most recent number for religious accommodations was 23, as of Nov. 23, he added.\nIn total, the service involuntarily separated 3,746 Marines before the mandate’s repeal.\n\nControversy stokes vaccine hesitancy\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent development of a vaccine presented a unique situation for the military, an institution known for requiring a battery of inoculations, all of which can be given during initial medical workups as soon as recruits ship to training.\nBefore COVID, the anthrax vaccine had caused much controversy in the early 2000s, resulting in involuntary discharges for refusals and pushing DoD to rethink how it decides to make a vaccine mandatory.\nIn that spirit, the Pentagon rolled out its COVID-19 vaccination program on a voluntary basis in December 2020, delaying making it mandatory until the Food and Drug Administration granted fully licensed the Pfizer version of the vaccine in August 2021.\nBut by that point, COVID-19 vaccination had opened a fierce partisan divide, with many conservative politicos and influencers railing against it.\nSoon after each of the military services published their mandatory vaccination policies, lawsuits sprang up, from troops accusing the services of wrongfully denying religious accommodation requests, or arguing that applying for one was futile because messaging from the chain of command made it clear they wouldn’t be approved.\nPost-mandate, the numbers suggest that the vaccine awareness brought on by the fierce ideological debate over the COVID-19 vaccine might have increased overall anti-vaccine sentiment across the services.\nIn the Air Force, overall vaccine exemptions went up during the 18 months between the COVID-19 vaccine mandate’s announcement and repeal. In August 2021, the Air Force reported 336 total administrative vaccine waivers on file. As of Jan. 3, according to service data, that number has more than doubled: 12 in the active component, 742 in the Air National Guard and 62 in the Air Force Reserve.\nBecause each of the services has taken a different tack when tracking vaccine waiver requests and exemptions, it’s difficult to make apples-to-apples comparisons to the numbers before the COVID-19 vaccine mandate.\nIn August 2021, the Army reported 106 overall administrative exemptions, which included religious exemptions, as well as temporary waivers for soldiers on temporary duty, in the middle of a permanent change-of-station move or preparing to leave service in the next 6 months.\nPost-mandate, now tracking religious waivers specifically, the Army is currently assessing five applications for other vaccines, none of them so far approved.\nThe Navy and Marine Corps reported in summer 2021 that they did not have any current religious accommodations, and hadn’t granted one in nearly a decade.\nCurrently, according to Navy data, there are no pending religious waivers for vaccines other than COVID. In the Marine Corps, Bruce said, no other religious waivers have been granted in the past two and a half years.\nAnd, Navy spokeswoman Gloria Kwizera told Military Times, the service doesn’t have a process for requesting a permanent medical waiver for other vaccines.\n“Navy Medicine does not track the number of Navy service members who request permanent medical exemption from a non-COVID-19 vaccine from their provider,” she said.\nThe Navy’s Bureau of Medicine and Surgery is also responsible for the Marine Corps.\nEach of the military departments is responsible for governing its own vaccine exemption process, so it’s difficult to compare numbers of each type of waiver across the services.\n\nWhy they said “no”\nWhile anti-vaccine sentiment has grown in the U.S. in recent years, reflected in localized outbreaks of polio and measles, Americans declined the COVID-19 vaccine at much higher rates than any other inoculation, members of the military included.\nHistorically, the kind of alternative beliefs, like anti-vaccine Jehovah’s Witnesses, that fostered opposition to vaccination were rarely found in the same demographics of people who were interested in military service, Katherine Kuzminski, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, told Military Times on Feb. 8.\nBut as some right-wing factions take up the anti-vaccine cause, there is a question of whether they’ll bleed into more mainstream conservative values, and whether that will in turn affect a historically conservative-leaning military population.\n“People who’ve been vaccine-aware have fallen, really, on the extreme,” she said.\nEmails from Military Times readers overwhelmingly make the distinction between the COVID-19 vaccine and previous inoculations that have been around longer and had longer testing periods before FDA approval.\nBut the services don’t have a waiver category for “I’m just not sure the science is there,” so most exemption requests defaulted to religious reasons.\nAnother major point of contention for readers was that the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson vaccines were either made with or tested on human stem cells descended from fetal tissue, which is commonly procured after abortion procedures. But Catholic leaders have long said the “sin” is too far removed from the vaccine itself to violate any religious beliefs.\n“The Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines were tested using an abortion-derived cell line,” Archbishop for the military services Timothy P. Broglio said in an October 2021 statement, explaining that simply testing with those cells is not sinful, whereas he states that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine “was developed, tested, and is produced, with abortion-derived cell lines”, which makes it more problematic.\n“If it were the only vaccine available, it would be morally permissible, but the faithful Catholic is to make known his or her preference for a more morally acceptable treatment,” the archbishop said.\nBut there are other mandatory vaccines that use these same fetal-tissue-derived cell lines in their development, including chickenpox and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), all of which most troops are required to take as part of basic training if they don’t have their vaccine record handy upon enlistment.\n“I did see several soldiers who claimed ‘religious exemptions’ to the COVID-19 vaccines due to the fetal cell lines used in research,” wrote one reader, an Army sergeant and medic stationed at Fort Riley, Kansas.\n“Most of these soldiers had no problem taking the MMR vaccine (which also uses fetal cell lines) in basic training so I found their newfound religion unconvincing, especially since I never saw them at chapel,” he told Military Times in an email, requesting anonymity out of concern for career repercussions.\nAsked whether new vaccine awareness had prompted existing troops to seek waivers for vaccines other than COVID-19, only one Military Times reader said he had considered it.\n“I do have strong religious beliefs that I think are consistent, demonstrable and should qualify. To be honest I feel the burden of having gone against them to save my career,” an Air Force captain stationed at Joint Base San Antonio told Military Times, who also requested anonymity out of concern for career repercussions.\nGiven the choice, the captain said he wouldn’t get the annual flu vaccine for personal reasons, but he did not specify which vaccines he would consider a waiver for and why.\n“Part of the problem is that these requests, like conscientious objector requests, do not permit a gradation of understanding,” he said. So, to try to qualify under the exemption terms, troops often cited strongly held beliefs that stemmed from a personal creed but weren’t demonstrably supported by any religious tradition or guidance from religious leaders.\n“Those who are opposing the vaccine didn’t do themselves any favors by trying to frame it in religious freedom language, when it actually was [that] there may have been some who were opposed to the the process by which the vaccines were developed, or they were opposed to the political process that developed the vaccine at the speed that it did,” Kuzminksi said. “There isn’t a clear avenue for them to register that complaint.”\nThis lines up with the many lawsuits filed against DoD by service members who opposed the vaccine, including those who sought religious exemptions.\nWhile some based their arguments on opposition to abortion, there were many complainants who cited more ambiguous beliefs, including concerns about the messenger ribonucleic acid technology in the Pfizer and Moderna products, or about what they put in their bodies in general.\n“Plaintiffs’ sincerely held religious beliefs that their bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit and that they are to glorify God with their bodies lays the foundation for everything they do, consume, or inject into their bodies,” read one lawsuit, Navy SEAL 1-26 vs. Biden , filed in Florida. “From this foundation, they make studied and reasonable decisions about what is good and what is not good or may not be good for their bodies.”\nMilitary leaders hoped they’d solved the objection problem when the Pentagon approved the use of alternative vaccine Novavax. But DoD data shows just 5,000 troops completed their vaccine series in the three months following Novavax emergency use authorization. For comparison, more than 300,000 troops were vaccinated in the three months prior to Novavax’s release.\n\nCulture Clash\nIn the end, troop objections may have risen because of the Pentagon’s about face in vaccine policy, Kuzminksi said. Because the COVID-19 vaccine was voluntary for the first nine months of its availability, service members had the rare option to make an independent medical decision. The mandate took that choice away.\nThe result – that a small but vocal minority of troops and their allies on Capitol Hill were able to extinguish the Pentagon’s vaccine mandate – is sure to trigger similar attacks on other controversial public health or social policies.\nMembers of Congress have already targeted diversity, equity and inclusion programs, as well as Pentagon efforts to combat violent extremist activity and sentiment. A Senate Armed Services Committee report from July argued that “spending additional time and resources to combat exceptionally rare instances of extremism in the military is an inappropriate use of taxpayer funds,” and should be discontinued immediately.\nIt’s a political counteroffensive that started, or picked up momentum, in the early days of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s tenure, when he ordered an anti-extremism stand-down and directed the department to beef up its screening, education and research efforts to both prevent extremism in the ranks and get a better idea of its prevalence.\nIn recent weeks, the move to equalize access to reproductive health care has also sparked the ire of Republicans in Congress.\nFollowing an announcement that DoD would cover travel costs for troops who have to travel out of state for a self-paid abortion, a group of senators sent a letter to the Pentagon demanding information on other procedures covered under that kind of policy, as well as whether anti-abortion commanders will be reprimanded if they attempt to deny leave under the new policy.\nCongress is well within its powers to pass legislation hemming in Pentagon policy, but partisan squabbles have the potential to keep undermining the very definition of a lawful order, by empowering individual troops to push back against them based on personal belief, according to Kuzminski.\n“That’s part of your oath, right? When you join, you’re setting aside your individual preferences or concerns in order to follow a lawful order,” she said. But with the COVID-19 mandate, “individuals who push back on a lawful order fundamentally saw that it worked.”"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 30, "end": 110}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 113, "end": 203}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 230, "end": 251}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 416, "end": 448}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 451, "end": 534}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 553, "end": 633}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 636, "end": 712}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1229, "end": 1259}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 1297, "end": 1345}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1349, "end": 1528}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1791, "end": 2067}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1796, "end": 1802}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1852, "end": 1857}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2270, "end": 2287}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2571, "end": 2576}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2608, "end": 2613}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2643, "end": 2649}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2660, "end": 2776}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 2824, "end": 3071}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 3075, "end": 3199}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 4180, "end": 4638}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 4650, "end": 4934}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 5078, "end": 5377}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 5078, "end": 5168}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 5380, "end": 5438}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5401, "end": 5421}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 6256, "end": 6411}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 6414, "end": 6534}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6496, "end": 6532}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 6673, "end": 6805}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 6998, "end": 7218}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 7252, "end": 7778}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 7621, "end": 7776}], "article_id": "4224", "lang": "en", "text": "The year 2023 has proven that climate change is not coming – it is here and things are spiraling out of control\n\nPoliticians often talk about climate change being a problem for future generations to solve, but many scientists say now is the time to act and that the climate has already changed – it is not a distant scenario. Never before has the devastating impact of global warming been more evident than in 2023, the hottest year in human history.\nBut if this trend continues, 2023 could be one of the coolest years in recent memory. In other words, if we don’t change our relationship with fossil fuels, things will get much worse. In the meantime, we can expect the pile of broken records to continue to grow. Here are some of the key reasons why 2023 became a pivotal year in our anthropogenic downward spiral, but given our ever-changing baselines, it’s probably not an anomaly.\n\nThe summer of 2023 was the hottest summer on record.\nWhen United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the world in September that the summer of 2023 had been the hottest summer in history, he did so in unmistakably vivid and dramatic language.\n“Our planet has just endured a sweltering season – the hottest summer on record. “The climate breakdown has begun,” Guterres declared, later adding: “The dog days of summer don’t just bark, they bite.”\nThis year will see “a new global temperature record,” which “underscores the fact that the planet continues to warm as we continue to burn fossil fuels and cause carbon pollution.” In fact, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the June to August 2023 period saw an average global temperature of about 16.77 °C (62.19 °F), an increase of 0.66 °C (33.19 °F). F) compared to the previous year corresponds to normal average.\nThis extreme heat is not only miserable, it can also be very deadly, essentially triggering mass casualties, exacerbating wildfires, driving up healthcare costs and damaging critical infrastructure, all at a time when the… People have to run at full speed. if they even have it. Additionally, an estimated 90 percent of humanity is expected to suffer even more extreme heat in the coming years.\n\nThe world is expected to warm by 1.4°C in 2023\nLast month the WMO released another terrible statistic: The The planet’s temperature is expected to rise 1.4º Celsius (2.5º Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. In addition, the organization’s preliminary state of the global climate confirms that 2023 will be the hottest year on record (instead of 2016).\n“Greenhouse gas levels are record high. Global temperatures are record breaking. Sea level rise is record-breaking. Sea ice in Antarctica is at record low levels,” WMO Secretary-General Peterri Taalas said while discussing the report.\nThis figure is particularly worrying because experts believe that if the Earth warms by 1.5 degrees Celsius, a series of irreversible feedback loops will occur, including the collapse of the Gulf Stream current in the Atlantic Ocean and rapid melting from the Arctic and Antarctic to Greenland.\n\nThere will be a new global temperature record in 2023\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the average global surface temperature from January to October 2023 was the highest ever recorded in the 174-year history since these readings were taken. Notably, global surface temperature during this period reached a staggering 1.13 °C (2.03 °F) higher than the 1901–2000 average of 14.1 °C (57.4 °F). The previous record, set between January and October 2016, was 0.08 °C (0.14 °F). The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) estimates that there is over 99% chance that 2023 will be the warmest year in history.\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the January to October 2023 period was the warmest on record, with a temperature 1.44 °C (2.59 °F) above average. In the Southern Hemisphere, the January-October 2023 period was also the warmest on record, with average temperatures 0.81 °C (1.46 °F) above average.\n“I expect these records to be broken on a regular basis due to ongoing climate change. But I didn’t expect them to be broken in such large quantities.”\n\nThe heat content of the oceans will also set a new record\nWhen the salon contacted Dr. Addressing Dr. Michael E. Mann, a professor of earth and environmental sciences at the University of Pennsylvania, he listed among the most important climate change news in 2023 that this year “will see a new global surface temperature record.” which “underscores the fact that the planet continues to warm as we continue to burn fossil fuels and create carbon pollution.”\nMann also pointed to another worrying development – namely the “heat content of the oceans, which is also set to set a new record.” He argued that this is “of equal importance because warming oceans are helping to destabilize ice shelves and fuel more powerful hurricanes and tropical cyclones.”\nActually, loudly NOAAOctober 2023 was the seventh consecutive month of record high monthly global sea surface temperatures. Already in August NASA announced that “the ocean has a fever,” with NASA oceanographer Josh Willis explaining that the two main factors behind the record highs are “an El Niño forming in the Pacific, on top of long-term global warming.” This caused ocean temperatures to nearly rise everywhere steadily for a century.”\n\nThe melting ice also suffered major damage\nAccording to WMO, Antarctic sea ice extent reached an all-time low in 2023, at least in terms of what scientists have known since the beginning of the satellite age in 1979. From June onwards, the sea ice extent reached a record low and the annual maximum in September 2023, the total area was 16.96 million km2, around 1.5 million km2 below the average from 1991 to 2020. The authors drew particular attention to Switzerland, where “the “Glaciers have lost around 10% of their remaining volume in the last two years.” Glaciers in North America and elsewhere in the European Alps were hit.\n“The global sea ice minimum observed earlier this year underscores the larger trend toward melting ice, warming polar regions, and destabilizing ice sheets,” Mann wrote to Salon.\n\nBottom line: 2023 is on track to be the hottest year on record\nAs the WMO announced at COP28, the United Nations climate summit in Dubai, 2023 is “almost certain” to be the hottest year on record once December 31 passes. As Petteri Taalas, the secretary general of the WMO, explained in Dubai: “It is a deafening cacophony of broken records.”\nThe experts who spoke to Salon agree with this assessment.\n“The record monthly global mean temperature records this summer are unusual,” Michael Wehner, senior scientist in the Computational Research Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, told Salon by email. “I expect these records to be broken on a regular basis due to ongoing climate change. But I didn’t expect them to be broken in such large quantities. So that’s scientifically interesting.”\nWehner added: “Still, I am more concerned about the regular but increasing record-breaking global average temperatures we have seen over the last two decades or so. This shows that we have not slowed down climate change.”\nMann repeated this observation.\n“The record temperatures of 2023 highlight how ongoing human-caused warming will continue to be accompanied by natural climate fluctuations – in this case [weather patterns like] El Niño – to exceed ever new thresholds, including increasingly prolonged periods when global surface temperatures exceed 1.5°C and brief moments when we even exceed 2°C,” Mann told Salon. “It is a warning that if we fail to dramatically reduce carbon emissions in the coming years, we will consistently exceed these thresholds in a decade or two.”"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 63, "end": 156}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 289, "end": 448}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 465, "end": 580}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 635, "end": 648}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 827, "end": 870}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 873, "end": 934}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 937, "end": 978}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 981, "end": 1103}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1141, "end": 1253}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1565, "end": 1605}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1752, "end": 1899}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1950, "end": 1970}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1977, "end": 2084}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2126, "end": 2132}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2319, "end": 2421}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2369, "end": 2381}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2560, "end": 2696}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3570, "end": 3848}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 3851, "end": 3950}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3851, "end": 3950}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 3952, "end": 3966}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 3969, "end": 4049}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 4095, "end": 4356}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 4636, "end": 4661}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 4665, "end": 4677}], "article_id": "4225", "lang": "en", "text": "Ramaswamy Vows to Boot US-Born Children of Illegal Immigrants: 'The Family Unit Will Be Deported'\n\nThere is a right way and a wrong way to enter this country. Recently, hundreds and thousands of illegal immigrants have been crossing the border daily — and they are doing it the wrong way.\nPresident Joe Biden and his administration are welcoming them through the door with open arms, instead of shutting it in their faces and telling them to go home.\nSounds harsh? Not as harsh as what the American people now must do to cope with the flood of illegals that has crossed our borders. The economic and societal implications are becoming insurmountable.\nEvery state has been affected. The few Republican governors that have fought back, like Republican Govs. Greg Abbott of Texas and Ron DeSantis of Florida, have quickly learned how left-wing our judicial system has become. Illegal is no longer hard-n-fast, rather it is a sliding scale.\nThat alone is destroying the United States. There isn’t a state among us that isn’t receiving illegal immigrants by hook or by crook and dealing with the repercussions. Even New York City has had enough.\nDemocratic Mayor Eric Adams’ recent remarks demonstrated just how bad things have gotten in his neck of the woods. Frankly, if he’s complaining, you know it has to be bad as he was a strong sanctuary city proponent.\n[X post (former Twitter)] #BREAKING : Mayor Eric Adams of New York City declares that the city is facing a significant influx of illegal immigrants who are crossing US border from various parts of the world. “The city we knew, we’re about to lose”.#Newyork #Mayor #EricAdams #immigrants #illegal… [video] — mishikasingh (@mishika_singh)\nEnter Vivek Ramaswamy, Republican presidential candidate.\nRamaswamy’s own family immigrated to the United States, too, but legally. He knows the scope of the path in which to take because his family took it. Like many other legal immigrants, he has become enormously frustrated with the leniency the current administration has had regarding the overtaking of the border by illegal immigrants. He is tired of undocumented immigrants abusing the system and skipping the line to enter the United States, especially in the face of his personal history with it.\nIn a recent interview following a town hall and shared by NBC News, Ramaswamy remarked on his disapproval of how this broken system was impacting the welfare of our nation. He addressed how he and his administration would handle the crisis.\nHis solution included deporting illegal immigrants without apology. Very clear in his desire to keep families together, Ramaswamy declared that under his administration, “The family unit will be deported.”\nWhen asked if this would include deporting children who had been born in the United States to illegal immigrant parents, Ramaswamy gave a one word answer: “Yes.”\nRamaswamy mentioned differing views on the rights of children born in this nation to illegal immigrant parents, claiming “There are legally contested questions under the 14th Amendment of whether the child of an illegal immigrant is indeed a child who enjoys birthright citizenship.” Certainly, how the 14th Amendment is ultimately interpreted would impact what Ramaswamy or any other president could do.\nThe 14th Amendment reads, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” Under the present administration’s interpretation, the 14th Amendment makes these children American citizens. However, Ramaswamy interprets the 14th Amendment to mean that one isn’t necessarily an automatic citizen of the United States if their parents broke the law in being here and they just happened to be born during that time.\nThere would be enormous pushback in deporting these kids. That said, how long can we allow the rewarding of our laws being broken before our nation collapses? It needs to end. In this, Ramaswamy is courageous enough to say what so many Americans are feeling. Not just Conservative Americans, mind you.\nThe U.S. needs to oust these illegal immigrants from our nation and send them back home — together, as a family.\nAmericans shouldn’t pay for illegal immigrants’ purposeful decision to break the law. I feel for the kids, but that soft heart won’t save our country. It will sink it, leaving no country for them to even come back to and to become naturalized citizens through the legal process.\nVivek Ramaswamy continues to clearly communicate who he is and what his presidency would look like.

That’s not easy, but it is the only way forward for Israel, is the only way forward for long-term peace.”\nWell, it’s not the only way forward, right?\nIsrael could clamp down on Palestinian autonomy until the violence against innocent Jewish civilians stops, and residents start living peacefully with their neighbors and begin accepting history’s outcomes.\nThat’s another option.\nWhile the situation today is appalling, creating a three-front Iran-backed terror state on the borders of a nation the size of New Jersey would make things significantly worse.\nNo sane citizenry would sign off on such a suicidal policy.\nNo genuine ally would pressure a friend to do it.\nBut that is exactly what a new country called “Palestine” is destined to be: an Islamic autocracy and, more than likely, a proxy of Iran (which may well have nuclear weapons at some point).\nPerhaps Murphy is unaware that the last time Israelis handed autonomy of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority in 2005 — ejecting thousands of Jews who would otherwise have been murdered by the only “ethnic cleansers” in this conflict — it quickly lost power.\nAnd does any sentient person believe that Hamas or the Islamic Jihad or Muslim Brotherhood-proper wouldn’t end up running a Palestinian state again?\nDoes Murphy want to send in US troops to Gaza when they do?\nBecause Israel, compelled to act on the inevitable provocations from this freshly created nation with unfettered access to weaponry, surely would.\nThe resulting war would be deadlier than the one going on now.\nRest assured, when Hamas runs a state in the West Bank that bumps right up against major civilian Jewish populations, it won’t be “us” — certainly not a Connecticut politician’s home — targeted by missiles.\nThese days, we keep hearing how Hamas is a tyrannical organization that doesn’t truly represent the will of the Palestinian people.\nIf they only had real elections, things would be different.\nThis, too, is either a lie or wishful thinking.\nWhile Hamas might not be quite as popular with Palestinians as it is with American Ivy League students, it nevertheless garners significant support.\nIn 2021, the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research found that 53% of Palestinians believed Hamas was “most deserving of representing and leading the Palestinian people,” while only 14% preferred the somewhat less terroristic Fatah.\nMost polls show similar or more enthusiastic support for Hamas.\nIt’s the reason there hasn’t been an election in the West Bank in over a decade.\nHamas would win.\nEasily.\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. Palestinian culture is steeped in generational, self-destructive, virulent animosity toward Jews that manifests in waves of extremism and violence.\nThis was the case in the early 20th century when Arabs began sporadically massacring Jews before Israel existed, throughout the 1940s when Palestinian leadership embraced Hitler and during a post-war faux nationalism phase (also before Israel existed), in the 1960s when the Palestine Liberation Organization introduced the world to modern terrorism (before “occupied territories” existed), and to the present Islamist iteration of that violence.\nYet Palestinians and their defenders remain the only people in the world who think they can reset history every time they lose a war of aggression.\nTheir very claim to a state is contingent on the myth that Israel invaded and “occupied” the West Bank and Gaza (and Tel Aviv) in an act of colonialism, when the “occupied territories” were taken in defensive wars against Egypt and (the existing Palestinian-majority state of) Jordan.\nBut forget history.\nForget that you can dig anywhere in the ground and find ancient Jewish artifacts.\nForget that Israel offered Arabs back the land on numerous occasions in exchange for basic recognition.\nMore importantly, there is zero evidence that Palestinian self-governance will lead to more peace — quite the opposite, in fact.\nMurphy’s notion that the only way to bring about coexistence is to reward the vilest act of Jewish murder since the Holocaust speaks to the destructive, insular, morally confused nature of the Brookings-approved DC blobthink.\nEvery time the sides revisit the negotiations on the terms dictated by these people, it ends in disappointment and, inevitably, violence.\nFortunately, this state can’t be willed into existence by Hamas-friendly newspaper editorial boards, nor by resolution-happy tyrants at the United Nations.\nAnd that’s fine. Just as there is no independent Hungarian nation in Transylvania and no Republic of Basque, there may never be a “Palestine” — or rather, a second Palestine (Jordan being the first).\nNothing says there has to be.\nYes, the situation might be intractable right now.\nBut that is no reason to make it worse."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 0, "end": 93}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 96, "end": 304}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 314, "end": 336}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1388, "end": 1398}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2764, "end": 2832}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2894, "end": 2902}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2918, "end": 3007}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3145, "end": 3154}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3167, "end": 3290}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3372, "end": 3492}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3872, "end": 3917}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3936, "end": 3941}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3968, "end": 3979}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 4485, "end": 4946}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 5026, "end": 5171}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 5174, "end": 5378}], "article_id": "4237", "lang": "en", "text": "Wisconsin’s dangerous abortion restrictions threatened my life and will continue to harm women\n\nNearly a year and a half after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and Wisconsin’s 1849 abortion ban went back into effect, it may be easy for some to forget the harm that the ban has been inflicting. But as anti-abortion lawmakers in our state continue to pass legislation to obstruct and stigmatize abortion, I can’t forget what these restrictions do to women like me.\nI was 19 weeks pregnant when I went into previable preterm labor with advanced cervical dilation: Our son had not developed enough to survive outside of my womb. My husband and I would inevitably lose him. We couldn’t imagine that our state’s laws would create a situation that would nearly cost me my life in the process.\nThe night before we lost our son, while my husband was away for work, I lay in bed in severe pain, searching desperately on my phone for a potential, and hopefully harmless, cause. What I read reassured me that I was just experiencing round ligament pain,meaning the ligaments surrounding my uterus were experiencing short, painful spasms. As the pain worsened, I held onto hope that I just needed to rest to alleviate it.\nIn and out of sleep all night from severe cramps, I froze at 5 a.m. when I woke to find my underwear soaked with blood. I immediately FaceTimed my mom, a nurse, who frantically said to go to the emergency room. My father took me to the hospital. I was inconsolable as he tried to convince me that everything would be okay. At that point, we were all trying to convince ourselves of that. But deep down, I had only a sliver of hope that it would be. Unfortunately, it was even worse than expected.\nI was quickly taken into triage and transferred to the obstetrics wing. Providers rushed in, first checking for a fetal heart rate. They found the heartbeat with little difficulty, and it was strong. I breathed a loud sigh of relief; while I knew there was an issue still to be resolved, I became more convinced everything would be okay. My mom told me my husband was nearby, and I was ready to tell him the good news.\nThe attending physician arrived and explained she was going to perform a pelvic exam. No one could have prepared me for what she found. My amniotic sac was bulging. What I had perceived to be round ligament pains were actually contractions, and I was six centimeters dilated. I was in labor. All I could tell myself was that this couldn’t be happening. Our baby was coming today, and at 19 weeks gestation we knew he wouldn’t survive.\nWhen my husband arrived, I was nearly hysterical. We were moved to the labor and delivery unit.\nThree doctors separately outlined how sick I would have to be before they could provide care: Under Wisconsin’s abortion ban, they couldn’t legally take action yet. Three doctors explained the risks I faced because of these egregious restrictions: I could expect an infection, sepsis or another critical illness that could result in death. Not only would I painfully lose my baby, but I could lose my life.\nSo we waited, feeling the most pain we have ever felt, as I labored hopelessly for hours. Because of the legal uncertainty surrounding our state’s abortion ban and the fear of legal consequences that accompanies it, I had to wait until I crashed to be treated instead of swiftly receiving care. The law ties doctors’ hands and forces women to be on death’s door before they can receive the care they need and deserve.\nEventually, my white blood cell count jumped, which indicated infection, and my heart rate accelerated while my blood pressure plummeted. I was prepped for an emergency dilation and evacuation, but learned once I came off of anesthesia that our baby delivered naturally. He lived for only one hour.\nWhile our son couldn’t have been saved, the way we lost him was made worse by Wisconsin’s extreme and dangerous abortion ban. I couldn’t just grieve for this loss, which was excruciating enough — I also had to needlessly worry about living. This additional fear could have been prevented had my doctors been allowed to provide safe and simple abortion care.\nEven though a Dane County judge has issued a preliminary finding that the 1849 law does not ban elective abortion, leading Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin to resume offering abortion care in Milwaukee and Madison, women are no safer. Doctors attending pregnant women in critical medical distress are being forced to hesitate to act.\n“Wisconsin leaders are tying doctors’ hands by preventing them from providing swift abortion care to patients in medical distress,” said Dr. Kristin Lyerly, a Green Bay OB/GYN and member of the Committee to Protect Health Care. “Doctors should be able to rely on their medical expertise to treat patients, not be forced to follow dangerous policies passed by legislators who prioritize their political agenda over the health and well-being of their constituents”\nWhile Wisconsin leaders continue working to restrict and stigmatize abortion, we want our story to serve as a reminder that these laws have life-threatening, heartbreaking implications for women and families across our state.\nMy husband and I firmly believe that lawmakers have no place in the exam room, and that women need to be able to make their own health care decisions with their doctors, particularly in medical emergencies. Abortion is not black and white; each circumstance that leads a woman to seek care is unique. That’s why one-size-fits all bans and laws don’t work. My family and I do not want another family to have to experience the trauma we have endured."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Doubt", "start": 0, "end": 39}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 450, "end": 462}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 854, "end": 887}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 900, "end": 1025}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1051, "end": 1079}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1463, "end": 1471}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1542, "end": 1588}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1633, "end": 1652}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1683, "end": 1701}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 2392, "end": 2600}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 2992, "end": 3438}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 3909, "end": 4021}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4697, "end": 4788}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 5311, "end": 5418}], "article_id": "4238", "lang": "en", "text": "Could We See A Ukraine-Russia Phony War?\n\nNews coming from the battlefield in Ukraine has seen a shift in the descriptions of the military situation since the beginning of the war. If we remember, analysts were then describing what appeared to be the technological superiority of the Ukrainian armed forces thanks to the support of Western allies and NATO in particular. Today, we look at the situation and the same analysts compare it to one of the most horrific aspects of the First World War: trench warfare. This is basically the cancellation of any technological superiority on either side and a return to hand-to-hand combat. It is a return to the time of cannon fodder, as it was described during the First World War.\nAlthough it dates back to at least the 17th century, trench warfare is a symbol of the First World War. These trenches embody an incomprehensible reality of horror. They were narrow, muddy corridors, marked by biting cold, the incessant threat of artillery bombardment and omnipresent unburied corpses. This evokes a world of absolute violence and cruelty, which is what the front looks like in Ukraine today.\nAccording to Francois Cochet of the Museum of the Great War in France, soldiers were immersed in a constant state of anxiety in the face of the possibility of sudden death from enemy shells, while coexisting with rats and lice. The deafening noise of explosions punctuated their daily lives. The trenches not only symbolize the brutality of war, but also the physical and mental exhaustion of the fighters, compelled to survive in dehumanizing conditions where the simple act of living takes on an unbearable dimension, turning every moment into a terrifying struggle for survival.\nThe current situation on the front in Ukraine, which also evokes a clear stalemate situation, raises many questions, especially on the role of countries in the West in terms of supporting Ukraine and how to move forward. As President Volodymyr Zelensky continues to travel the capitals of the world urging military and financial support, this clearly outlines that the decision of whether to continue or stop the war lies in the hands of politicians in Washington and Europe.\nOn that matter, the domestic political landscape also resembles trench warfare. We can plainly see the divide among politicians between those supporting Ukraine and those who want an end to the war. This is particularly true in the US, where the divide has largely been between Democrats’ continuous support and a majority of Republicans stating that this support, in a time of economic challenges, must stop.\nAs the US enters a presidential election year and the Ukrainian file is somewhat overshadowed by the situation in Gaza, it is without doubt a crucial time. As the conflict gets bogged down and with no achievements on the ground for Ukrainian troops, it is clear that Russia can bear this deathtrap status quo much better than Ukraine, which is now completely dependent on Western support. This forces politicians, who now realize that their promises of Moscow collapsing are becoming a distant mirage, to reposition their stances. As domestic files put pressure on the outcome of elections, there is a greater chance of Kyiv facing increasing pressure to sit at the negotiating table and find a deal. This would mean an end to the war via a long-lasting ceasefire and an acceptance by Ukraine of a direct loss, but without announcing it.\nThe other scenario would be to recalibrate the support to help Kyiv cope with this stalemate situation. This implies an economic revival of the country while controlling the intensity of the conflict on the front lines. This would be reminiscent of the Second World War’s “phony war” — the state of watchful waiting and almost no confrontations between France and the UK’s declaration of war on Nazi Germany on Sept. 3, 1939, and the German offensive on May 10, 1940. This would mean leaving the wound open while waiting for a decisive way to change the situation on the front line. Who would benefit the most? We could easily see how Moscow would be better capable of using this situation to its advantage. Yet, it would also save face for Western politicians.\nBeyond these questions, one can start to see that, since the end of the Cold War and now with the renewed great power competition, Europe has been unable to develop a long-term unified strategy vis-a-vis Moscow. This is what is still lacking today. The great unity in support of Ukraine cannot be defined as a strategy in the context of geopolitical competition. Moreover, focusing solely on economic interests, like Germany did, does not work. There needs to be a more comprehensive approach.\nThe reality is that, if we look into Europe’s domestic politics, we are back in the trenches. There is an entire spectrum that advocates opposing Russia in all shapes and forms and another that promotes the establishment of a full alignment of interests. Election cycles continue to move from one to the next and from one country to another and will continue weakening the European stance.\nIt is clear that, regardless of what happens, we are moving toward a shift in the support Ukraine receives from Western countries. The most probable outcome is to give Ukraine the possibility of getting out of the trenches. However, leaving this wound open would increase the risk of the war suddenly expanding to the rest of Europe."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 95, "end": 110}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 95, "end": 331}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 336, "end": 398}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 336, "end": 613}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 360, "end": 372}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 624, "end": 636}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 803, "end": 932}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 935, "end": 1142}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1232, "end": 1278}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 1434, "end": 1630}], "article_id": "4239", "lang": "en", "text": "Hawkish Israeli finance minister calls for facilitating migration of Palestinians from Gaza\r\n\r\nUltranationalist Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has renewed his call for the Palestinian population of Gaza to willfully migrate, suggesting that their departure would pave the way for Israelis who “would make the desert bloom.”\r\nSmotrich, known for his bitter hatred of Palestinians and Arabs, and who is not part of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s war cabinet discussions on Gaza’s future, emphasized the need to encourage emigration from the Strip during an interview with Israeli Army Radio on Sunday.\r\nIn his racist remaks, Smotrich proposed that reducing Gaza’s population to 100,000 or 200,000 Arabs instead of the current two million would significantly alter the post-war scenario.\r\n“Most of Israeli society will say: ‘Why not?

They’ve poisoned mental institutions and prisons all over the world, not just in South America, not just the three or four countries that we think about, but all over the world. They’re coming into our country, from Africa, from Asia, all over the world. Nobody’s even looking at it.”\nHitler used similar language about Jews “poison[ing] the blood of others,” in “Mein Kampf,” his 1925 manifesto.\nTrump also praised authoritarian leaders in other countries, including North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whom he called “very nice” and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, whom he called “highly respected.” And he endorsed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s criticism of President Joe Biden.\nNew Hampshire’s primary is Jan. 23, following the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 15.

Chris Christie, who is running in the GOP primary on an anti-Trump platform, called the comments “disgusting” during an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday.\n“He’s disgusting,” Christie said. “And what he’s doing is dog-whistling to Americans who feel absolutely under stress and strain from the economy and the conflicts across the world. He’s dog-whistling to blame it on people from areas that don’t look like us.”\nChristie added that leading Republicans who continued to support Trump were complicit. He noted that almost 100 members of Congress have endorsed Trump and that presidential rival Nikki Haley of South Carolina called Trump fit to be president.\n“Nikki Haley should be ashamed of herself,” he said. “She’s part of the problem because she’s enabling him.”\nThe Haley campaign did not respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nAuthoritarian rhetoric\nTrump has consistently degraded immigrants since his entrance into national politics in the 2016 presidential race and it continues to be among his most prominent themes as the campaign intensifies heading into 2024.\nIn the run-up to the 2016 election, Trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States” and issued an executive order a week after entering office to block travel from certain Muslim-majority countries.\nThe executive order, and a successor, framed the policy as a national security issue in response to terror threats, but federal courts still blocked it for violating religious freedoms and other civil liberties. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately upheld parts of the order, but Biden revoked it in full on his first day in office.\nIn recent weeks, Trump has made a string of comments that suggest he sees himself as an authoritarian leader.\nIn a November speech, he described his political opponents as “vermin,” another term used by Hitler and his World War II ally Benito Mussolini of Italy.\nAnd in a Fox News town hall this month, Trump responded to a request to dispel fears he would be a dictator in a second term by saying he would be a dictator only on his first day in office to take measures to control the border and expand fossil fuel development.\nHe emphasized that pledge Saturday.\n“My first day back at the White House, I will terminate every open-borders policy of the Biden administration, stop the invasion of our Southern border and begin the largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” he said.\nRepublicans often use the word “invasion” to characterize the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border.

When Adolf Hitler asked for safe passage to East Prussia through the Polish corridor and also for the occupied port of Danzig, not many could have imagined that it would spiral into a world war that would cost 85 million lives and leave an unspeakable trail of devastation in its wake.\nMore than one million Africans died. They were not in Danzig, Berlin or London. They had no idea what Hitler’s request was or why Britain refused to listen to him. They were enlisted for the war by force from Nigeria to Burkina Faso (then Upper Volta), and from Senegal to the Democratic Republic of Congo. On the 75th anniversary of that war two years ago, the few survivors on the continent still bore the scars like yesterday, yet not knowing the reason they went to fight in the first place.\nThere has been nothing like that ever since. On the whole, large scale conflicts have declined even though Iraq, Syria, Darfur and Yemen remind us that the world is never too far away from the base instincts that invited the past atrocities.\nExaggerated comparisons of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Hitler have surfaced since the outbreak of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine. But let’s be clear, Putin is not Hitler.\nWhat is not in doubt, however, is that after decades of Russian humiliation following the collapse of the Soviet empire, Putin has been obsessed with the glory of a Russian past which Europe and America have not only stirred but inflamed by aggressively besieging the wounded bear.\nIt’s a bit like the Treaty of Versailles all over again. After defeating Germany during the First World War, the Allies were not content to impose heavy retribution, including the excision of the mineral rich regions of Alsace and Lorraine from Germany. They went ahead to impose a financial penalty of £6.5 billion on Germany, which would have taken the country decades to repay. The victor wanted the vanquished vanquished, never again to rise.\nThe crushing weight of that humiliation was too much for the Germans to bear. The result, of course, was Hitler and the Second World War.\nThe West may not have imposed heavy financial costs on Russia after the collapse of USSR, but Putin, who was at that time an officer in the KGB, saw, first hand, the humiliation that followed the collapse of his country, the triumphalism of the West and its relentless efforts since to crush whatever is left of Russia’s pride and spirit.\nThat is the source of Putin’s rage. Of course, to understand it is not to excuse or justify the current invasion. But to ignore it as the West has mockingly done, is foolish.\nPutin insists that after the former Soviet Union broke up into 15 states, there was an agreement between President Mikhail Gorbachev and the West that NATO will not expand East. NATO has denied the existence of such an agreement, but has barely hidden its subversive encouragement in bringing three countries under the former Soviet Union into its fold, virtually encircling Russia. For Putin, the invasion of Ukraine is his last stand, his push, after Crimea, for Russia’s modern-day Danzig.\nHow is that any of Africa’s business?\nThere have been noises here and there, including, in fact, the threat of sanctions against Russia by a few African countries. The strongest argument from Africa against the invasion is perhaps the one by Kenyan diplomat, Martin Kimani, to the UN: “This situation,” he said, “echoes our history. Kenya and almost every African country, was birthed by the ending of an empire. Our borders were not of our own drawing. They were drawn in the distant colonial metropoles of London, Paris and Lisbon.”\nKimani was right about that historical fact. However, the truth now as it was in 1884 during the scramble for and partition of Africa, is that in spite of the significant progress that the world has made to establish a rules-based system, the strong, in pursuit of self-interest, will continue to lord it over the weak.\nAfrican states are content to leave the colonial boundaries largely untouched not because they love good neighbourliness any less than Israel loves its Arab neighbours, for example, against whom it has waged one of the longest, bloodiest modern-day wars. Unlike Israel, however, perhaps many African countries do not feel sufficiently threatened by their neighbours or even where such threats may exist, the consequences of aggressive expansion far outweigh the benefits of remaining within their present borders.\nIn short, Africa has remained what it is because of the lack of capacity among its state actors to exact any meaningful change in its border status however much they may desire it.\nIn 2006, for example, Nigeria chose peace instead of war with Cameroun over the Bakassi Peninsula dispute not only because the judgement of the International Court of Justice was unfavourable, but more importantly, because it knew that the negative consequences of taking Bakassi by force far outweighed the benefits. Cameroun, just like the other Francophone states in the subregion, has a defence pact with France which might have been activated if Nigeria, or any other aggressor, attacked.\nIt’s not because Morocco loves Saharawi Arabs or out of deference for the original Spanish-drawn boundaries that it has been unable to seize the territory after decades of a bloody conflict; no. It’s simply because Rabat has lacked the military capacity to enforce and maintain its will.\nWhat Putin is doing is insane, reprehensible and extremely dangerous but both Putin and those who oppose him in the West bear collective responsibility for the horror playing out in Ukraine today. At a time when Ukrainians ought to start getting their lives back after nearly 20 years of corrupt oligarchic reign, followed by a genuine yearning for change which brought Volodymyr Zelensky to power three years ago, the West has escorted Ukraine into a war it will not recover from in a long time.\nAfrican speeches must not cut the US or its Western allies any slack. Cuba was exercising its democratic right as an independent country in 1962 when it permitted the USSR to place missiles on its soil. But President John F. Kennedy said it was over his dead body that this would happen in his backyard. He threatened war until Nikita Khrushchev removed the missiles and pulled back from what would have been the world’s first nuclear war.\nAccording to American historian, Christopher Kelly, and British historian, Stuart Laycock, the US has invaded or fought in 84 countries of the 193 countries recognised by the UN and has been militarily involved with 191 of the 193.\nA story in the Washington Post in March 2016 not counting America’s familiar atrocities, said the US government tried to change other countries’ governments 72 times during the 45-year-long Cold War, an average of more than one every year, possibly earning itself the title of history’s all-time meddler-in-chief. And of course, the consequences of the atrocities of the US and its allies whether in Iraq, Afghanistan or Libya, have not always been pretty.\nBut I’m concerned here about what Russia’s invasion could mean for Africa, especially thousands of students from the continent currently schooling in Ukraine. Although the statistics are scanty, there are reports of at least 8,000 Moroccans and 4,000 Nigerians studying in Kiev and other Ukrainian cities, a good number of them in the medical sciences.\nUnfortunately for these students, their leaders back home will not be in any of the major European capitals where the decisions already being taken to resettle refugees prioritise “Ukrainian Europeans” over other nationalities. Even before the shooting war started, other countries had taken advantage of intelligence and early warning systems to evacuate their citizens and minimise the disruption to their lives.\nAfrica, with perhaps the weakest capacity for a nimble response, waited till war broke out before acting. And yet, this task, far less mundane than contemplating the redrawing of its boundaries, reveals just how hopelessly incompetent the continent’s leaders can be in figuring out their own self-interest.\nRussia knows why it is invading Ukraine, in spite of global condemnation and the unprecedented sanctions it must endure: it is self-interest. And the US and its allies know why in spite of their frustration and anger, they can only watch Russia invade from the sidelines: it is self-interest.\nAs for Africa, the restriction of colonial boundaries is not the only reason it is often confused about its self-interest. Years of mental slavery, poor cultural attitudes, weak and heavily dependent institutions and poor leadership have combined to create boundaries of iron worse than anything that drawers of the geographical boundaries contemplated.\nWhat’s Africa’s interest in Ukraine? A bit more history could be of service in the continent’s quest for an answer."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Doubt", "start": 315, "end": 503}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 506, "end": 647}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 885, "end": 1001}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 1331, "end": 1509}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1449, "end": 1481}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1552, "end": 1703}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1649, "end": 1703}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1706, "end": 1922}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1747, "end": 1775}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1925, "end": 2253}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2255, "end": 2420}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3254, "end": 3282}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 3374, "end": 3416}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3494, "end": 3500}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3536, "end": 3544}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3582, "end": 3736}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3596, "end": 3609}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3910, "end": 3925}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4079, "end": 4128}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4113, "end": 4128}], "article_id": "4242", "lang": "en", "text": "Trump offers concessions on immigrants in return for wall funds\n\nUS President Donald Trump on Saturday offered to temporarily shield a million immigrants from deportation if Congress authorizes funding for his Mexican border wall -- an idea Democrats rejected, making the US government shutdown likely to continue.\nTrump attempted to seize the initiative in ending the 29-day partial shutdown, a funding freeze that has left many important government departments relying on unpaid or highly reduced staff.\nHis bargain, announced in a televised White House address, held out the carrot of protection from deportation for two categories of immigrants.\nThese include 700,000 so-called \"Dreamers,\" children of people who settled illegally in the US, and who have become a favorite cause of the Democrats, as well as 300,000 other immigrants whose protected status is expiring, Trump said.\nThe president said these concessions would \"build the trust and goodwill necessary to begin real immigration reform.\"\nIn return, Trump demanded the $5.7 billion he says is needed to extend fences on the border with Mexico, something the opposition Democrats have repeatedly refused to authorize. That has prompted the president to retaliate with the government shutdown, which he triggered by not signing off on funding to swaths of departments.\n\"I'm here today to break the logjam and provide Congress with a path forward to end the government shutdown and solve the crisis on the southern border,\" Trump said in his address.\nTrump describes the US-Mexico border -- for decades a magnet for migrants and asylum seekers, as well as a major drug smuggling route -- as overwhelmed, posing a threat to US national security.\nDemocrats, who accuse Trump of using his illegal immigration crackdown to score political points with his right-wing base, spurned the latest negotiating offer as soon as it was leaked in the media prior to the speech.\n\"His proposal is a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total, do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people's lives,\" said Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House of Representatives and the face of Democratic opposition to Trump. \"They are a non-starter.\"\nHowever, Trump's speech was the latest sign that both sides may slowly be grasping for a way out of an impasse that has turned into a test of brute political strength.\nThe New York Times reported that Democrats have added more than $1 billion to their previous offer of $1.3 billion for new border security, even if that is still far short of Trump's $5.7 billion figure.\nThe Times said roughly half the additional $1 billion being offered by Democrats would go to improve infrastructure at ports of entry, and the other half would fund 75 new immigration judges -- but with no new money for a wall.\nWhile each side waits for the other to blink, some 800,000 federal employees have been caught up in the shutdown, waiting for paychecks. They include members of the Coast Guard, FBI and airport security staff.\nAll are expected to receive back wages once the shutdown ends, but in the meantime, many have had difficulty paying bills or even feeding their families.\nThe partial government shutdown -- a disruptive political weapon almost unique to the American system -- began on December 22 and is now the longest ever.\nWhile polls show more Americans blame Trump and the Republicans than the Democrats, both sides are feeling pressure, as disgust rises across the country with the paralyzed political leadership in Washington.\nAdding to the sense of chaos, the dispute has turned deeply personal, with Trump and Pelosi exchanging what to many seem like almost playground-level jibes.\nAfter Pelosi suggested shelving Trump's upcoming State of the Union address before Congress -- one of the key set-piece political appearances of the year -- the president abruptly revoked her right to use an air force plane for a trip to Afghanistan.

In February 2020, I wrote a piece wondering whether the coronavirus outbreak, as we called it then, might spell a similar doom for China’s communist regime. Although no one saw fit to publish the essay then, the eerie parallels between the two disasters continue to be provocative.\nIt was on April 26, 1986, that the No. 4 nuclear reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, near the city of Pripyat (in what is today Ukraine), suffered a massive explosion — large enough to blow the 2,000-ton reactor casting straight through the reactor building’s roof. Even so, it wasn’t until traces of radioactive fallout were detected at a Swedish nuclear facility the next day that Soviet citizens began to hear of what had happened from foreign news sources — as did the rest of the world.\nThe number of short-term deaths from the disaster (those who died immediately or in the weeks or months thereafter from radiation sickness) is about 54; estimates of long-term deaths as a result of exposure to radiation vary widely, from thousands to tens of thousands and even much higher.\nThe Chernobyl disaster cost the Soviet regime whatever credibility it had with its citizens and was the last nail in the coffin for the image of Soviet communism abroad. For the current Chinese communist regime in Beijing, the growing evidence that COVID does not have zoonotic origins — that it did not jump from animals to humans — as China still claims, but most likely leaked from a lab at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, points to culpability for a global disaster far worse than Chernobyl: so much so that it is not unreasonable to speculate about its implications for the regime’s survival.\nMoreover, there is evidence that the Chinese government covered up the severity of the outbreak in China while allowing the virus to spread abroad. Thus it’s also possible to speculate that Beijing saw the COVID crisis not as a tragedy but as an opportunity to disrupt economies and societies around the world, to China’s advantage.\nCould the international furor over COVID reach a point where Xi Jinping’s colleagues decide he makes a convenient scapegoat and turn him out? Given that he has modeled his reign after Mao’s ruthless one-man rule and grip on power, that may be unlikely. Even if it were to come to pass, Beijing’s total surveillance state would prevent Chinese citizens from learning anything like the truth of what happened in Wuhan, and why.\nWhen the Chernobyl disaster struck, the Soviet regime was already on its last legs. By contrast, China’s bid for global hegemony is just starting to crest. It is an essential part of the Chinese Communist Party’s identity, regardless of what happens to Xi. China’s leadership has been engaged in a long march to global power since Mao Zedong came to power in 1949. Mao’s successors, starting with Deng Xiaoping, have committed themselves wholeheartedly to that epic journey.\nDespite the friendly face he showed to the West, it was Deng who first described relations with the U.S. as a “cold war” and who made it clear to his colleagues, if not to the outside world, that the goal of his market reforms of the Chinese economy was to “enrich the state and strengthen the military.” What Westerners assumed were reforms to integrate China into the global economic system were actually steps aimed at dominating and controlling that system in order to achieve hegemony.\nIn the 1990s, Deng’s chosen successor as general secretary of the CCP, Jiang Zemin, launched China on a course of massive military buildup; in the first decades of this century, Hu Jintao engineered China’s high-tech total surveillance state, including the Great Firewall, and launched a Chinese cyber-offensive that stole hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of intellectual property from an unsuspecting world — the biggest transfer of wealth in history.\nXi’s grandiose Belt and Road initiative and his Made in China 2025 master plan are only building on the superstructure his predecessors established to make China the world’s dominant superpower by any means necessary — possibly including using, or taking advantage of, the COVID pandemic as a way to hobble the economies of China’s rivals, particularly the United States.\nIndeed, China’s surge into recombinant DNA research, as outlined in Xi’s 14th Five-Year Development Plan, could signal Beijing’s interest in scouting out an even more virulent agent as a potential bioweapon.\nIt’s to be hoped, though, that the world did draw lessons from Chernobyl, which revealed the moral bankruptcy of the regime that allowed it to happen and then tried to cover it up. COVID, in turn, has taught us a sobering lesson about the risks we all run in collaborating with or appeasing Beijing.\nThree million dead, tens of trillions of dollars lost worldwide: It’s a terrible price to pay for ignoring the present and future threat posed by a power-obsessed regime."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 304, "end": 325}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 448, "end": 468}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 774, "end": 1493}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1393, "end": 1493}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 1495, "end": 1916}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1530, "end": 1633}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 1587, "end": 1631}], "article_id": "4245", "lang": "en", "text": "U.S. abortion clinics closing after Supreme Court ruling\n\nFollowing the U.S. Supreme Court ruling reversing American women’ right to abortion on Friday, abortion clinics in the country are said to be closing down.\n“Clinics have begun closing in some US states,” BBC reported on Saturday. “13 states have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion banned within 30 days.”\n“At an abortion clinic in Little Rock, Arkansas – a state with a so-called trigger law allowing an instant ban – the doors to the patient area shut as soon as the court’s opinion was posted online.”\nOn Friday, the U.S. apex court overturned Roe v.

The patient battled with steadily sinking oxygen levels and received medical attention for one hour before dying on the hospital bed. This dramatic and heartbreaking incident was the first known case of COVID-19 in Haiti, and the virus has continued to spread since then.\nHaiti is one of the poorest countries in the world. It experiences some of the world’s highest rates of death due to natural disasters, which have generated large-scale instability, poverty, and lack of shelter for many Haitians. These conditions have caused the Foundation for International Community Assistance (FINCA) and other organizations to predict that the virus “could be devastating” in Haiti, and the world braced itself for the worst. But the worst has not come. At least not yet. While COVID-19 has been difficult to endure in Haiti, the high number of recoveries and lower than expected infection rates indicate that COVID-19 has not yet grown into the monstrous disaster in Haiti that many people thought it would. This surprising outcome could have been generated in part by the changes Haiti implemented in the aftermath of the disasters it has changed—the same disasters that analysts thought would make it easier for COVID-19 to devastate the island. Still, the relative success that Haiti has seen with the virus so far does not put them in the clear, and the country could face worse consequences once COVID-19 is over. Before these analyses can be made, however, it is critical to understand the battle Haiti has fought against this disease so far, particularly with regard to misinformation, economic instability, and healthcare resources.\n\nRumors and Misinformation\nAs of October 6, 2020 the World Health Organization reports 8,819 cases and 229 deaths in Haiti, with a flattening curve. Since the first case of COVID-19 within Haiti’s borders, there have been rumors circulating about the existence/real threat of the virus. Many residents question whether or not the virus is real, or at least its severity. Some Haitians think that COVID-19 is just a way for their government to secure more foreign aid money, which has come and gone without helping some of those who need it most. Even among those residents who do believe in the severity of COVID-19, there is distrust toward local hospitals. Residents think that experimental vaccines are being tested there without patient knowledge, as if bodies and lives were expendable. As a country with a strong oral tradition, communication between community members is a large part of how important information is spread. Both of these reasons have resulted in many people delaying a hospital visit and treatment until they are in a critical condition, because an earlier hospital visit would result in ostracization from their community. Contact tracing would require people to acknowledge that there is a problem, and the current lack of social distancing, masks, or other safety measures would make such tracing incredibly difficult even if it was implemented.\nDoctors Without Borders has made efforts to help address these problems. They have focused particularly on educating local community leaders about COVID-19 to help them discern between fact and fiction so they can spread that knowledge to those who trust them. But this process is slow, and even slower now that large community meetings can’t be held to answer questions and assuage fears. Only time will tell if these campaigns are able to make an impact.\nMisinformation can be detrimental to the evolution of the sanitary situation, but Haiti's problems with COVID-19 go beyond the rumors that are spread by word of mouth. As is the case in many other countries, the necessity to work and make a living for survival has hindered the possibility of social distancing, leading to an increase in transmission.\n\nThe Economic Issue\nMany Haitian households live day to day off the money they make, which is often US$2 per day or lower. In late April, John Carrol, MD, blogger for the Journal Star, wrote: “Haitians are angry that the informal street markets have been closed but that the large textile factories in Port au Prince and in northern Haiti were reopened this week.” The government has prioritized the profits of sweatshop owners and foreign businesses interests over the informal markets and businesses owned by their own citizens. These actions reflect the corrupt government priorities that have fueled mistrust amongst citizens, but also the lack of power citizens have to advocate for themselves and their working conditions while experiencing extreme poverty. These factories are also unlikely to provide working conditions that protect and prevent people from COVID-19 transmission, increasing spread amongst populations that can’t afford to make or buy masks. This means that part of the population isn’t allowed to work, increasing their risk for hunger and poverty, while another large part of the population has work, but the lack of protective measures makes them more vulnerable to transmission.\nTo add to Haiti’s struggle, the bordering Dominican Republic has had one of the worst resulting government responses to COVID-19. Because of the porous border these two countries share, controlling the virus in Haiti has become increasingly difficult. Since the start of the pandemic in March, about 24,000 Haitians who worked in the Dominican Republic have fled the area and returned to their homes in Haiti, creating a population influx into already densely packed streets.\nWhile quarantine and shutdown measures were taken soon after the first case appeared in Haiti, the economic conditions make a complete shutdown like those seen in other countries currently impossible. If Haiti were to take a turn for the worse, and Haitians were to stop working, the economy would be severely damaged. If they lost the ability to go to work, individuals would lack the resources they need for survival, which could quickly create large socio-economic divides between Haiti and the rest of the world.\n\nA Lack of Equipment\nFinally, lack of equipment in Haitian hospitals may contribute to the rise of COVID-19 on the island. The treatments and tests that doctors are able to give are limited. While there are 41 centers in Haiti that could utilize platforms like Cepheid to implement more testing, Haiti is not receiving tests from manufacturers. Wealth disparities impact many developing countries, as tests are going to the countries who can afford to pay more for them, mostly the US and Europe. In Haiti, protective equipment is lacking and hospitals are unable to set up effective isolation to ensure patient safety because of this. However, in spite of all these challenges, Haitian hospitals have weathered the COVID-19 storm better than predicted with a nearly 82 percent survival rate. In order to understand why Haitians appear to be staying relatively healthy, it is necessary to look less toward the events of recent months and more toward the consequences of Haiti’s tumultuous past.\n\nCurses Come with Blessings\nSeveral unintentional factors have helped Haiti naturally defend itself against this virus so far. One of the country’s most prominent doctors Marie Deschamps says that the “country has been very vulnerable” to a wide array of challenges, such as “political destabilization, impacts of deforestation on farmland and drinking water sources, hurricanes, and a never-ending procession of infectious diseases” to name a few. These disasters may have created some of the conditions most helpful to Haiti during this crisis, and it is important to analyze them in tandem with the community’s response to this sickness.\nWithin homes, social distancing is difficult, but many are well ventilated as a result of the climate and the many natural disasters that have impacted construction, which reduced the likelihood that infectious particles will infect others within the space. This is often a result of natural disasters, which have rendered better insulated homes uninhabitable, forcing families to relocate and find less traditional shelters. Haiti’s history with other disease outbreaks such as AIDS and cholera may also have contributed to early immune responses in the body to defend against COVID-19. Additionally, a youth group leader who works toward defeating misinformation in Haitian slums explains that “[Haitians] know there are many people who have ailments such as fever, flu. They stay at home, taking care of themselves with traditional medicine.” In this respect, it is a mixed blessing that people are waiting until it is critical to come to the hospital. While a perfect world would allow everyone experiencing symptoms to receive the treatment they need, if everyone went to the hospital immediately in the current context, the system would be quickly overwhelmed and unable to provide effective care. These factors, among others, have helped Haiti keep COVID-19 at bay, although they cannot keep the virus away forever.\n\nLong Term Implications\nAs well as Haiti is handling the virus now, there will be impacts that affect its population for a long time to come. Sandra Lamarque, head of Haiti’s Doctors Without Borders mission, reports that vaccinations for babies and children have dropped significantly, along with an even sharper decline in the number of women choosing to go to public hospitals to give birth.\nWhile it can be celebrated that COVID-19 has not taken as large a toll on Haiti as analysts originally thought it would, it is still necessary to be critical about how these results are interpreted and how these interpretations will influence decision-making in Haiti going forward. For starters, the number of cases and deaths up to this point is not certain, as testing has been scarce and many cases and deaths have gone uncounted. The natural guards Haiti has been able to take advantage of in its fight against COVID-19 will not be effective in the long term. After this international crisis is over, there will still be damages to reckon with and many who have suffered in every country, especially those countries who were already suffering before the pandemic."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Slogans", "start": 0, "end": 46}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 49, "end": 299}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 64, "end": 75}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 302, "end": 421}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 606, "end": 625}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 628, "end": 782}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 904, "end": 1103}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 1268, "end": 1295}, {"tag": "Obfuscation-Vagueness-Confusion", "start": 1298, "end": 1408}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1429, "end": 1456}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1696, "end": 1707}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1784, "end": 1803}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1806, "end": 2004}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2048, "end": 2063}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2218, "end": 2227}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2276, "end": 2287}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2552, "end": 2571}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2594, "end": 2605}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2665, "end": 2675}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2689, "end": 2700}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2716, "end": 2739}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2873, "end": 2917}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 2920, "end": 3074}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3006, "end": 3017}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3130, "end": 3145}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 3178, "end": 3462}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 3312, "end": 3326}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 3387, "end": 3462}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3773, "end": 3780}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3790, "end": 3804}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3895, "end": 3926}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4075, "end": 4179}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4391, "end": 4616}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4514, "end": 4527}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 4774, "end": 4845}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 4948, "end": 5020}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5027, "end": 5054}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5051, "end": 5054}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 5102, "end": 5255}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5418, "end": 5497}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5499, "end": 5534}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5653, "end": 5678}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5974, "end": 5979}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6140, "end": 6284}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 6286, "end": 6642}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 6859, "end": 7117}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 7678, "end": 7731}], "article_id": "4250", "lang": "en", "text": "Don’t Lose Sleep Over Climate Change Encyclical\n\nIt’s official. Progressives love Pope Francis. Their magazines, from Think Progress to Mother Jones, are abuzz with excitement in light of the recent rumor that the pope is going to issue an encyclical on climate change sometime in the next few months.\nAs a politically conservative American Catholic, I’m expected to throw a fit about this, and I hate to disappoint people. So even granting that this is still just a rumor, I’ll go ahead and admit that I would not welcome an encyclical that made carbon emissions a much-discussed topic. It would smack of intellectual faddism, and it’s always depressing to feel that Church authorities are more focused on trendy social controversies than on the fundamental business of saving souls.\nHaving said that, I’m not going to lose any sleep over a (possible) Church document on climate change. Nor should you.\nAs a political conservative, I care somewhat about political issues such as this. But as a Catholic (which is much more important), I mainly care about fundamental Church teachings on faith and morals. Climate change is only very distantly relevant to any of these, so nothing the Holy Father says about it is likely to muddy doctrinal waters to any great extent. The deposit of faith is safe. Frankly, we should probably be grateful if the talking heads chatter a lot about Catholicism and climate change. After the recent, literally scandalous debates over divorce and family issues, it might be a relief to see the Holy Father devoting his energies to environmental concerns, rather than stirring up doubt and division over central doctrinal or moral questions.\nI understand of course why progressives are so excited over an anticipated row between the Roman Pontiff and their conservative enemies. But there’s really no reason why this should happen, because when it comes to climate change, none of the controversial questions are of the sort that the Holy Father could definitively answer anyway.\nMost of the time, the figures tarred as “climate deniers” are simply people who insist on parsing the relevant ecological, economic and prudential questions with a carefulness that runs contrary to the zealous, unthinking activism that liberals would prefer to foster. Progressives love to promote a narrative wherein they are on the side of science, while conservatives (and religious people especially) are sticking their heads in the sand and wishing away the mountains of empirical evidence that run contrary to their views. On top of that, climate-change panic harmonizes with many secularists’ sense of drama and impending doom. We might see it as the apocalyptic side of the progressive’s tendency to “immanentize the eschaton.” Liberal sensitivities are most appeased when they feel that political forces are about to usher us all into a new, shining utopia … provided nature doesn’t obliterate us first. We may achieve the paradise of the perfect political order, but only if we can escape being damned for the sin of inventing civilization in the first place.\nClimate change, in other words, fits nicely with the pseudo-religious sensibilities of progressives. This is why people who understand nothing about the science will lobby aggressively for measures to reduce carbon emissions: because “science says so,” but also because it feels intuitively right to them that humans are on the verge of destroying themselves through environmental folly. Meanwhile, within the scientific community itself there is an army of public rent-seekers (not to mention providers of alternative energy, and Democratic politicians) who have everything to lose and nothing to gain from a relaxation of public concern over climate change. They are quite happy to stoke their acolytes into an activist frenzy. Taking all this together, there is plenty of reason to be cautious about jumping on the “science is settled” panic-wagon.\nOf course it doesn’t follow from this that climate change isn’t a real concern. It probably is, to some extent. But when we dig into the details, it turns out that “climate change” is a far more complex issue than environmental activists like to admit. Even identifying what the relevant questions are with respect to climate change is a challenging task. Answering those questions is even more difficult.\nLet’s start by considering the most basic of questions. Is climate change a real thing? On the most basic level, the answer is clearly “yes.” No intelligent person is actually a “climate denier,” because we all understand that it is entirely normal for the earth’s climate to change. Climate stasis would be the real aberration; climate change is the norm. The fact that it’s normal of course doesn’t mean that it’s not cause for concern. Changes in climate can cause all sorts of problems for human populations. But we shouldn’t act as though changes in climate represent some unique or unprecedented situation. Human civilizations have always had to adapt to changing weather patterns.\nOur harbingers of climatory doom are of course not satisfied with this answer. They suggest that the climate is changing more than it normally does, or ought to, or more than it would but for the adverse effects of human civilization. This is certainly possible, but the issue is hard to settle because of course we really don’t know what our climate would look like without human civilization. Would Hurricane Haiyan still have hit the Philippines in a cleaner-energy world? Would it have been as bad as it was? Any answer we might give to that question will be highly speculative. And for all we know, there may have been other terrible natural disasters that didn’t happen, owing to human impacts on climate. Once again, it would be unreasonable to dismiss entirely the possibility that humans are impacting their climate in an undesirable way. But we also should not forget that weather has always been unpredictable, changeable, and occasionally deadly.\nEven insofar as we can identify a likely connection between human activities (most especially carbon emissions) and climate change, further questions remain. Are the changes in climate negative for humans? And if so, are the economic costs of any recommended policy changes worth the climatory benefits?\nI suspect that Pope Francis’ remarks, assuming he does offer some, will center around two points. First, he will likely offer some general observations about the importance of exercising good stewardship over the natural world. And second, he will remark on the injustice of the wealthy continuing to live in comfort at the expense of the “most vulnerable.” This is a favorite theme of his, and climate change may seem to fit the narrative since developed nations have higher “carbon footprints,” while poorer nations have greater difficulty adjusting to climatory change. But before concluding that there is a clear moral imperative to restrict the use of fossil fuels, we should keep in mind that the “most vulnerable” will also suffer from rising energy costs. Without cheap fossil fuels, many more people will be hungry and cold. Abundant energy also tends to fuel job growth, which the Holy Father has highlighted in the past as a vital concern for modern societies.\nIt’s reasonable for the Holy Father to use his moral authority to address ethical issues relating to climate change. However, he cannot claim infallibility, or even great expertise, in all the relevant empirical, economic and prudential questions that play into the controversies surrounding climate change. There is no reason for this issue to precipitate a standoff between the Holy Father and American conservatives. We should save our worrying for more important matters."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 0, "end": 68}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 230, "end": 290}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 333, "end": 347}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 411, "end": 496}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 521, "end": 529}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 826, "end": 855}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 1042, "end": 1399}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1491, "end": 1506}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 1509, "end": 1771}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1827, "end": 1868}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2020, "end": 2038}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2236, "end": 2278}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2424, "end": 2558}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2874, "end": 3108}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3682, "end": 3717}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3822, "end": 3866}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3921, "end": 3936}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 4007, "end": 4052}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 4074, "end": 4151}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 4256, "end": 4292}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4443, "end": 4462}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4541, "end": 4563}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4788, "end": 4801}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4835, "end": 5042}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 5255, "end": 5356}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5645, "end": 5655}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 5658, "end": 5731}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 5817, "end": 5934}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5982, "end": 6019}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6314, "end": 6357}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 6407, "end": 6539}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 6740, "end": 6776}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 6813, "end": 6860}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 7059, "end": 7370}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 7844, "end": 8121}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 8059, "end": 8079}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 8123, "end": 8696}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 8699, "end": 8804}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 8807, "end": 8882}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 9246, "end": 9479}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 9349, "end": 9372}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 9436, "end": 9450}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 10257, "end": 10368}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 10387, "end": 10843}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 10846, "end": 11020}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 11068, "end": 11143}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 11202, "end": 11221}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 11836, "end": 12063}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 12169, "end": 12177}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 12380, "end": 12577}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 12579, "end": 12744}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 13067, "end": 13080}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 13269, "end": 13538}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 13541, "end": 13585}], "article_id": "4251", "lang": "en", "text": "Israel Arms the World’s Autocrats—With Weapons Tested on Palestinians\n\n“The Palestine Laboratory” outlines how Israel sells its “battle-tested,” “field-proven” weapons and spyware to practically anyone, no matter how malevolent.\n\nIt was a genocide many of the world’s leaders tried to ignore. In spring 1994, under the cover of war, Hutu extremists in Rwanda began eradicating the neighboring Tutsi population, killing upward of 800,000 civilians and forcing around two million to flee the country. At the outset of this murderous 100-day campaign, the United Nations discouraged international involvement, labeling it an “internal conflict,” but as it became clear to the Western public what was occurring, many countries sent aid. That summer, President Bill Clinton, who had dragged his feet despite the local U.S. Embassy warning of impending massacres, finally asked Congress for $320 million in relief; and Yossi Sarid, Israel’s minister of environmental protection, arrived in Rwanda with a medical aid delegation to assist survivors. Sarid’s gesture, however, was “all for show,” according to journalist Antony Loewenstein, because “both before and during the genocide,” even after much of the world enacted an embargo, the Israeli government had sent weapons to Hutu forces—Uzi submachine guns and Galil assault rifles, grenades and ammunition, in several shipments worth millions of dollars.\nThis wasn’t the first time, nor was it the last, that Israeli weapons and tech fell into malevolent hands. In his searing account, The Palestine Laboratory: How Israel Exports the Technology of Occupation Around the World, Loewenstein examines Israel’s modern war exports to Augusto Pinochet’s fascist junta in Chile, the repressive Shah of Iran, the Guatemalan genocide (where the country’s right wing called openly for the “Palestinianization” of Indigenous Mayans), and, more recently, authoritarian regimes in Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Hungary, India, and Azerbaijan, which earlier this year ethnically cleansed thousands of Armenians from its southwest.\nAs of 2022, the United States controlled an estimated 40 percent of the world’s weapons exports—nearly five times more than any other nation—but Israel, a desert country smaller than Massachusetts, also ranks among the world’s top 10 weapons exporters, in recent years boasting record increases in its market share, worth billions in sales. “Israel is almost unique among self-described democracies in not calling out or sanctioning atrocities worldwide,” Loewenstein observes. It sells to practically anyone, and has an unnerving sales pitch: Its gear is “battle-tested,” “field-proven”—assembled for use in the blockade on Gaza and the occupation of the West Bank and then sold around the world. Promotional tapes sometimes even use real-life video from drone strikes on military targets. Andrew Feinstein, an expert on the illicit arms industry, who determined one such film showed a number of Palestinian children being murdered from above, said, “No other arms-producing country would dare show actual footage like that.”\nWhen Loewenstein’s book was published earlier this year it received little coverage, but it has found new life amid the ongoing war. (The publisher, Verso, has made it free to download.) Because the situation in the Levant has changed so rapidly, some of The Palestine Laboratory is suddenly a touch out of date. (For instance, Loewenstein cites a 2021 Israeli poll saying most Jewish citizens “do not overly worry about solving the conflict with the Palestinians.”) Most of it, however, is dizzyingly prescient. In the West, Loewenstein argues, Israel is understood as a “thriving if beleaguered democracy,” allied with the United States against extremism, but look beyond the rhetoric and instead you’ll see a belligerent ethnostate with a vested interest in arming and training other belligerent ethnostates—a dark symbiosis upheld in the name of geopolitical necessity and economic interests.\n“Our friends can kill and maim with impunity,” Loewenstein writes, referring to friends of the U.S. and the U.K.: Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Israel. On November 21, a hostage exchange agreement paused the Israeli siege of Gaza for at least four days, but the war’s end is far from visible. As people across the globe report feeling the world is becoming more dangerous, modern warfare industries have grown right along with the number of nativist governments, not to mention the refugees they spurn. Beyond its own project of so-called Palestinian containment, Israel considers its role arming the world’s autocrats and border agencies and producing spyware key to its continued existence, just as the technology itself helps other states achieve their own definitions of “security”—however bloody—in an ever destabilizing world.\nHow to summarize nearly a century of Zionist and Palestinian bloodshed and peacekeeping—of industrialization and expulsion, the birth of a “rules-based international order,” war, occupation, the dot-com boom? Loewenstein begins with his own story: He grew up in a “liberal Zionist” community in Melbourne—his grandparents had fled the Nazis in 1939, arriving in Australia as refugees—but he grew uncomfortable with both “the explicit racism against Palestinians that I heard and knee-jerk support for all Israeli actions.” This discomfort led him to the Israel “beat,” so to speak, which he has covered, living in Israel on and off, for more than a decade. “It made sense to view Israel as a safe haven in case of future strife for the Jewish people,” he remembers thinking, but one man’s safety was another’s death knell.\n“It’s either the civil rights in some country or Israel’s right to exist,” said Eli Pinko, the former head of Israel’s Defense Export Control Agency, in 2021. “I would like to see each of you face this dilemma and say: ‘No, we will champion human rights in the other country.’” Under this ethos, the Israeli economy quickly “abandoned oranges for hand grenades,” as one critic memorably quipped. After the Six-Day War in 1967, when the 19-year-old nation launched a preemptive strike on its neighbors—taking over the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights—a new era in Israeli politics began. The actions set the country, Loewenstein says, “on a military path that has never stopped,” though, to be fair, Israel wasn’t the only one. Just six years before, Dwight Eisenhower had warned of the dangers of an American military-industrial complex in his farewell address. It would be a mistake to consider that clunky term as merely representing a national problem. Instead, these two complexes, American and Israeli, developed interdependently within a broader system.\nArm in arm with them was South Africa. Some pundits bristle when critics compare modern Israel to the old apartheid state, arguing that the particulars are different. What’s undeniable, however, is that in the 1970s Israel cemented a military and security agreement with South Africa that endured secretly for decades. Anton Liel, the head of Israel’s foreign ministry desk in South Africa in the 1980s, wrote recently that Israel “created the South African Arms industry” and, in turn, South Africa helped finance Israel’s technology: “When we were developing things together we usually gave the know-how and they gave the money.” This partnership enabled Israel to develop its nuclear arsenal, Loewenstein says; it became the only country in the region with its own nuclear arms. (Despite pleas from nonproliferation groups, the U.S. lets Turkey hold around 50 of its nukes, within spitting distance of Russia and Iran.)\nIsrael was the last nation in the world with strong ties to the apartheid regime. An old South African government yearbook explained what bonded the two countries “above all else”: Both are “situated in a predominantly hostile world inhabited by dark peoples.” Decades later, caught on a hot mic, Netanyahu echoed the sentiment in a meeting with far-right Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán: “Europe ends in Israel. East of Israel, there’s no more Europe.”\nIn the same conversation, Netanyahu admonished the European Union, Israel’s greatest economic partner, for placing milquetoast conditions on trade to incentivize peace talks with Palestinians—conditions that hadn’t stalled the EU’s increased reliance on Israeli border technology but were nonetheless, to Netanyahu, a slap in the face. Indeed, for whatever pearl clutching may exist among some European politicians about how Israel treats Palestinians, the EU had little trouble justifying the use of Israel’s border tech against migration from Syria, Libya, and Afghanistan. More recently, countries like Germany have boosted their weapons sales to Israel to support its war effort. “Palestinians were the guinea pigs for Israeli technology and surveillance,” Loewenstein argues, and the EU viewed these containment tools “as an achievement to be copied in its own territory.”\nSo has the U.S. Today, Israeli surveillance tools on our border with Mexico (and Guatemala’s border with Honduras) are used to choke out migration from Latin America. Indeed, post-9/11, Israel became a kind of North Star for many U.S. policies. In late November 2001, the CIA drafted a memo on the “Israeli example” as a possible basis for arguing “torture was necessary.” It was also among the 20-plus countries that helped transport “war on terror” detainees to CIA black sites.\nThat said, the relationship between the two countries is more contentious than many realize. Leaks from the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden illustrate this: In the 2000s, for instance, at around the same time the NSA was sending the Israeli government private emails and phone calls from Palestinian and Arab Americans—leading relatives who lived in occupied Palestine to potentially “become targets,” as Loewenstein writes—other documents show that agents believed our alliance was “a constant challenge,” “arguably tilted heavily in favor of Israeli security concerns.” Given the U.S. security state’s fervor after 9/11, this state of affairs stung. “Nevertheless,” the report continues, “the survival of the state of Israel is a paramount goal of US Middle East policy.”\nAdditional top-secret documents listed Israel as the “third most aggressive intelligence service against the US” (emphasis mine), grouped in with China, Iran, Russia, and reflecting growing U.S. concern with Israel’s cyberwarfare capabilities—and that “trust issues” plague the two agencies’ relationship. To this day, we continue to exclude our so-called “greatest ally” from the “Five Eyes” alliance between the U.S., Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and the U.K., an intelligence-sharing compact Loewenstein calls “the most secretive and intrusive” in the world—perhaps for good reason.\nIn November 2021, the Biden administration took a rare step by blacklisting two Israeli surveillance firms, the NSO Group and Candiru, that have deep ties to the Israeli state. NSO in particular, and its spyware, Pegasus, which can remotely and covertly harvest essentially everything on your phone, had fallen into hot water upon being traced back to the brutal assassination of Jamal Khashoggi (the Saudis purchased Pegasus with the approval of Israeli authorities in 2017) and the persecution of journalists and human rights activists around the world. While Biden’s move was welcome, Loewenstein remarks, the likely reason behind it was that “an Israeli company was encroaching on American technological supremacy.” Ironically, NSO recently hired a new lobbyist in Washington: Stewart Baker, a former general counsel of the NSA.\nIf you know where to look, the alliance between our two countries appears deeply strained despite claims to the contrary, and yet a certain harmony remains. The Palestine Laboratory is an invaluable primer on how the West enables Israel’s occupation and weapons sales, how Israel enables the West’s border-fortifying spree, and the careful policing required—both discursive and literal—to maintain this balance, where no one but our enemies are deemed hostile and our friends get away with brutality practically unscathed. (Loewenstein shows too how Israeli surveillance companies meticulously track social media, pressuring companies like Facebook to censor keywords like “resistance” and “martyr.”)\n“The worst-case scenario,” Loewenstein writes in his conclusion, “is ethnic cleansing against occupied Palestinians, or population transfer, forcible expulsion under the guise of national security.” Today, we’re witnessing exactly that, with (at the time of writing) more than 11,000 killed in Gaza and an ongoing evacuation of its northern region ordered by Israel. On Wednesday, after reaching a brief truce with Hamas, Netanyahu told reporters it was “nonsense talk” that the fighting would stop after hostages were returned, emphasizing that this was merely one of many “stages” of the war. In mid-November, in what we might consider an addendum to his book, Loewenstein appeared on Democracy Now! to discuss the ongoing war. “Israel is already, as we speak … live-testing new weapons in Gaza,” he said, likely referring to a new laser- and GPS-guided mortar bomb called “Iron Sting,” manufactured by the Israeli firm Elbit Systems—the same company that, with government approval, helped militarize the U.S.–Mexico border, armed Myanmar’s military junta even after its violent coup, and supported Azerbaijan’s ethnic cleansing with state-of-the-art drones.\nOur friends, to put it simply, have been busy."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 0, "end": 139}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4, "end": 24}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 241, "end": 262}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 285, "end": 300}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 302, "end": 340}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 412, "end": 685}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 418, "end": 488}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 687, "end": 857}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 839, "end": 857}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 957, "end": 991}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1066, "end": 1083}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 1191, "end": 1200}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 1277, "end": 1426}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1602, "end": 1616}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 1618, "end": 1858}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 1880, "end": 1894}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2018, "end": 2041}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2166, "end": 2250}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2340, "end": 2425}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2427, "end": 2486}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 2517, "end": 2598}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2525, "end": 2534}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2781, "end": 3926}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 3929, "end": 4063}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4299, "end": 4360}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4653, "end": 4665}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4910, "end": 4937}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4970, "end": 4992}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5068, "end": 5080}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5117, "end": 5155}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5222, "end": 5230}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 5421, "end": 5557}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 5560, "end": 5659}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 5817, "end": 6018}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 6021, "end": 6103}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 6106, "end": 6191}], "article_id": "4252", "lang": "en", "text": "The Shocking Antisemitism After Hamas Attack Is Deja Vu All Over Again\n\nFor those who know American history, all of this has happened before.\n\nIt’s truly shocking to see on college campuses such vicious anti-Semitism and support for Hamas’s brutal, violent attack on Israel — in which Hamas barbarians murdered, tortured, raped, and beheaded men, women, and children, including babies.\nBut it is not surprising. Given the Marxist, socialist training camps that our universities have become, especially “elite” schools like Harvard Law School, where the editor of its law review was videotaped verbally and physically assaulting a Jewish student on campus, what else would anyone expect?\nAs Prof. Charles Lipson of the University of Chicago accurately says, the “neo-Marxist faculty” who have taken over these institutions strongly support “militant Muslims.” That support is reflected in many of the anti-Israeli, pro-Palestinian student organizations like “Students for Justice in Palestine” that want Israelis exterminated and have come out in full support of the sadistic terrorism of Hamas.\n“This is the most hostile environment Jewish students have ever faced in America,” Lipson says. He’s right.\nBut for those who know American history, all of this has happened before. These pro-Hamas, anti-Semitic groups, many of which are organized by ethnic Palestinians, are just like the infamous German American Bund of the 1930s. As the Holocaust Museum explains, the Bund was “an organization of ethnic Germans living in the United States” that supported Nazi Germany and was “fueled by antisemitism.” Sound familiar?\nThe German American Bund (the word in German means “federation”) “carried out active propaganda for its causes, published magazines and brochures, organized demonstrations, and maintained a number of youth camps run like Hitler Youth camps.”\nAgain, doesn’t this sound familiar? Just look at the propaganda being put out by pro-Hamas groups at college campuses all over the country; their support for a terrorist organization; and the anti-Israeli, anti-Jew hatred being spread by students and professors. Or at the Stanford instructor who labelled his Jewish students as “colonizers,” said the Hamas terrorists were “freedom fighters, and blamed Hamas’s murderous attack on \"Zionists.” Or the Chicago professor who called all Israelis “pigs,” “savages,” and “irredeemable excrement” who should “rot in hell.”\nBlaming the Jews for everything that has gone wrong in Gaza? We’ve seen that before, too.\nHamas’s tyrannical rule over Gaza sounds remarkably like the 1930s in Nazi Germany. An executive summary of a U.S. State Department report notes that Hamas, which exercises dictatorial control over Gaza, uses its “military wing to crack down on internal dissent.” The report lists the “significant human rights” abuses of Hamas in Gaza including:\narbitrary killings by Hamas personnel; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by Hamas personnel; arbitrary arrest or detention; political prisoners or detainees; serious problems with the independence of the judiciary; arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; serious restrictions on freedom of expression, including violence, threats of violence, arbitrary arrests or prosecutions of journalists, censorship, and criminalization of libel and slander; serious restrictions on internet freedom; substantial interference with the freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association; serious and unreasonable restrictions on political participation; serious government corruption; lack of investigation of and accountability for gender-based violence; crimes, violence, and threats of violence motivated by antisemitism; unlawful recruitment and use of child soldiers; crimes involving violence and threats of violence targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or intersex persons; and the worst forms of child labor.\nIf we didn’t know this was from a 2022 State Department report, we would think it was a 1939 State Department report about Nazi Germany.\nAnd speaking of 1939, in February of that year, the German American Bund held a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City, attended by 20,000 people. This was six years after Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power in Germany. The pogroms against German Jews and the virulent anti-Semitism of the Nazis were well-known. Concentration camps in which the Nazis were imprisoning political opponents, union leaders, and many others had been running since 1934. And Germany had already invaded and annexed Austria and the Czech Republic.\nThese so-called Americans of the Bund knew what brutish thugs the Nazis were. Yet they supported them anyway until the U.S. entered World War II, when the organization was outlawed by the government. The American, pro-Hamas cohorts know what Hamas is doing and has done both internally in Gaza and in its relentless terrorist attacks, and yet they actively support this cruel organization that the State Department in 1997 classified as a terrorist organization. Hamas killers even wore bodycams to record their terrible, heartless deeds of inhumanity, so none of its American supporters can claim ignorance of their barbarism.\nDean Erwin Chemerinsky of the Berkeley Law School says that “never” in his life has he “seen or felt the antisemitism of the last few weeks” that erupted after the Hamas attack on Israel.\nThe fact that it is happening again in America and that we have active organizations, just like the German American Bund, should scare us. We have to stamp this out now before it spreads even further and gets out of control like a wildfire.\nThat starts with school administrators, the media, government officials, Hollywood, and others no longer making excuses for the vocal supporters of Hamas. They should be criticized, condemned, and prosecuted when they engage in violence and threats, and made to suffer the personal and professional consequences of what they are doing, including losing jobs.\nIf they were members of the Nazi Party or the Ku Klux Klan, that would be happening.

A war that ended with an American withdrawal and a Communist victory. But that’s what happened.\nMuch the same can be said of our vain attempts to save Afghanistan from a virulent strain of militant Islam.\nHistory is replete with political and military miscalculations. The tragic costs of those mistakes are borne by ordinary people, especially by the young. Before we dive deeper into the boiling waters of the conflict between Ukraine and its Russian cousins, some tough questions need to be asked.\nThe first and perhaps most uncomfortable question is why. Why did Putin decide to advance diplomatic and political ends by military means? The smart guys in this administration (the ones still advancing the lie of Russian collusion) claim that Putin is just an evil warmonger. Maybe. But stupid he is not. Could it be that he meant it when he said that he would never allow Ukraine to join NATO and have American missiles positioned 100 miles from Moscow? Someone should be asking what our courting of Ukrainian membership into NATO contributed to the commencement of hostilities. Was that such a good idea?\nWhy are Americans being asked to foot the lion’s share of the costs for this proxy war? What of our European allies? This is in their neighborhood after all. Remember the ones who, after much gnashing of teeth, promised to pay their share for their defense? Their contributions are so far … pathetic. According to a report in the Telegraph, shortly after Russia launched the invasion, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged an extra €100 billion to bolster the German military, opening a “new era” in which they would do “whatever necessary” to defend NATO’s borders. At this writing, NONE of that money has been appropriated. All while our president is eager to throw another $30+ billion (that we don’t have) into the fire. Are we saps? Does anyone believe we will ever get an accounting of where our grandchildren’s money went? The gas company that bought protection from the Biden family isn’t the only corrupt enterprise in Ukraine.\nWhy are we underwriting a war that is killing so many on both sides and destroying Ukraine? Is it so that Zelensky can join NATO and be invited to strut at swank events like Davos? Who will bear the burden of rebuilding the country? If you don’t know the answer to that one you may stop reading.\nAnother question that almost no one has asked is, what is the end game? Do our pompous Pentagon patriarchs believe that Ukraine can defeat Russia? Remember their hollow promises of progress in Afghanistan? Their track record of over-promising is there for all to see.\nTo hopefully prevent an escalation, the rules of engagement guarantee that all fighting and destruction will occur on Ukrainian soil. That sounds like a limited war doesn’t it? Our experience with limited wars isn’t good. The brave young Ukrainians have heroically fought the Russians to a standstill thus far. Will the Russians turn tail or simply pull back to regroup and launch an even more aggressive offensive? Remember Hitler thought he had the Russians by the tail with a downhill pull. It didn’t end well.\nWhat if a desperate Putin decides to escalate and make strikes on Poland and other countries providing military aid? What is our contingency plan if the Russians begin to wear down the Ukrainians and are marching on to Kyiv? Or, what if the Chinese, seeing that we are otherwise distracted and running low on high-tech weapons, decide to move on to Taiwan? What then?\nA wounded bear is far more dangerous than a healthy one. Longer term, do we want to push the Russians into a closer alliance with China and Iran? How does that benefit our security interests?\nThese are difficult and uncomfortable questions. But they need to be asked and answered by our policymakers. These matters deserve sober consideration before we wind up in a nuclear confrontation or commit to another long, bloody, and expensive limited war. Perhaps now is the perfect time for some back-channel negotiations. The worst thing that could happen is that they might fail. The sense is that both sides are growing war-weary.

Abortion-homicide is NOT banned nationwide.\"\nImagine how support and the number of abortion-homicides would drop if everyone were required to use the truthful term, \"abortion-homicide.\"\nWe must unite and expose to the entire nation (not just our mailing lists) the Roe/Dobbs Big Lie, a legal fiction that demonically proclaims \"abortion-homicide is not homicide\" because a preborn baby is not legally alive according to \"the law of the land\" (yes, Dobbs) but \"… at most, represents only the potentiality of life.\" (Roe, page 162.)\nDefinition of \"potential\": possible, as opposed to actual, or \"not actually alive.\"\nAppallingly, 85% of Americans believe that demonic Big Lie – including the Dobbs justices who, when in effect reauthorizing Roe's genocide, used its executioner’s legal fiction uncritically 12 times!\nNote: \"Legal fiction\" is how corporations acquire legal \"personhood.\"\nExplaining Dobbs' genocidal culpability for upholding Roe's demonic legal fiction are two columns: \"STOP saying 'Roe was overturned'!\" (indicting the conservative justices), and \"How to end abortion-homicide AND defeat Democrats in 2024.\"\nThe Roe/Dobbs legal fiction (\"potential life\") is how courts deceptively evade using the word \"homicide\" when ruling on abortion-homicide.\nProtected by the demonic Roe/Dobbs legal fiction: 1-An abortion-homicide doctor can treat \"a woman\" instead of a mother \"with child.\" 2- Doctors commit hundreds of thousands of abortion-homicides yearly with no legal consequences, receive high pay (murder-for-hire), and are socially accepted by 85% of Americans – while a guy who kills his pregnant girlfriend gets charged with two murders.\nQuestion: What do Hitler's Nazis, Southern slave masters and today's abortion-homicides advocates/practitioners have in common?\nAnswer: Each group's crimes against humanity were/are socially acceptable because they were/are \"the law of the land\" (Dobbs).\n\nNegotiating with evil is appeasement\nDebating policy with the advocates of mass abortion-homicide implicitly, but clearly, accepts their premise (\"it\" isn't alive/human). Therefore, policy debates are just a matter of how we compromise with evil (15-22 weeks vs. 6 weeks, etc.).\nWatch this 5-minute clip from the DeSantis/Newsom debate (about abortion-homicide), especially the last 0:45, to see how DeSantis' policy debate implicitly, but clearly, accepted Newsom's premise: \"that 'it' isn't alive/human.\" Otherwise, why would DeSantis – or any pro-life politician – agree to any abortion-homicides – at any time – if he truly believes that abortion is homicide? As you listen, add \"-homicide\" to each \"abortion\" reference to understand how Newsom would lose all credibility – even to himself.\nWhat if 85% of the country favored slavery, killing Jews, or all of the lawyers? Are slavery and killing humans legitimate subjects for the ballot? Oh, it's OK when the victims are defined in law as \"inferior\" (Dred Scott), \"subhuman\" (Nazis), or \"potential life\" (merely an \"it\" according to Roe/Dobbs).\nEngaging in policy debates with genociders like Newsom 1) grants them credibility, 2) make us appear weak, and 3) emboldens them with self-righteousness – just watch Newsom.\nEvil was similarly appeased before the Civil War when the political compromise was to wrap the issue of slavery in a democratic veneer and let the states decide whether to legalize evil. Dobbs did the same!\nWithout their Big Lie euphemisms and our policy appeasements, political support for abortion-homicide will evaporate, and the reality-denying 85% (voters) will have to acknowledge the homicidal (personal) and genocidal (national) nature of their child-sacrificing obsession.\n\nThe Plan: 1- Unite! 2- Stop appeasing evil. 3- Take off \"the gloves,\" and swing God's Big Truth War Club to inflict some good ol' shame and guilt on the shameful and guilty – or we'll never expose the Big Lie to the deceived and/or undecided – the 85% we need to win elections\nThe good news is that we only need about half of them. Without them, however, it's subjugation or civil war.\nThis PR plan will devastate the party married to abortion-homicide just like that same party's commitment to slavery led to its 19th-century downfall when courageous Republicans stopped compromising and acted on their convictions.\nWe urgently need to test-market and roll out a national PR campaign to the 85% of Americans who need to be whacked upside their heads with God's Big Truth War Club about the living reality of our preborn brothers and sisters – before November.\n\nJoin the Pro-life War Club: email [email protected].\nShare this on social media; call/email every radio and TV show.

Meanwhile, a boat carrying some 750 economic refugees capsized off the Greek coast, killing hundreds who had boarded in Libya after making perilous journeys from places like Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Syria. Pakistan declared a national day of mourning for its citizens lost at sea. But the West paid hardly any notice.\nOf course, it is unfair to fault the press for responding to the demands of its audience. The relatively scant coverage of the migrants’ tragedy is symptomatic of a larger tendency to ignore the plight of those who happen to have been born in less privileged parts of the world. The mood has changed since the 2015 refugee crisis, when chilling photos of a migrant boy who had washed up on the Turkish coast elicited outrage and a vigorous response from policymakers in rich countries. In the intervening years, the Western public has become inured to such images, more often looking inward, or focusing on other priorities.\nTrue, a cynic might say that the intense coverage of the 2015 refugee crisis was motivated less by idealism than by pragmatic concerns about Europe being overwhelmed by millions of people fleeing from violence. But even if that was the case, the same concerns dictate that advanced economies pay more attention to the developing world’s problems today.\nMost governments around the world have recognised that they can no longer ignore climate change and other environmental damage. But ignoring the huge gap in living standards between the Global North and South has similarly become unsustainable. Owing to advances in communications technology and access to social media, the poor today are keenly aware of the vast differences between their lives and those of people living in rich countries. As long as these differences remain, they will keep pushing north in search of a better future. No border, no wall, and no sea will keep them where they are. The ongoing immigration crisis at the United States’ southern border and the continuing drama on the seas around Greece and Italy have made that clear.\nBut the quest for a better life is just the supply side of the equation. On the demand side, labour-market shortages have created a strong incentive to bring people into advanced economies to do the work that natives no longer do. In the absence of well-considered immigration policies that can satisfy this need, reckless smugglers have filled the void.\nThe labour-market shortages in advanced economies are not some temporary or short-run phenomenon. In the US, a recent Brookings Institution study documents a shortfall of 2.4 million workers as of December 2022, relative to the 12-month average ending in February 2020. Most of this decline would have happened without the pandemic, owing to changes in the age and education of the population. But there was also a decline in the average weekly hours worked, producing an additional labor-supply shortfall equivalent to another 2.4 million people.\nThis reduction in work hours cannot be attributed solely to COVID-19 or the fear of long COVID. While its causes are not yet fully understood, a re-evaluation of work-life balance seems a plausible hypothesis. In any case, the bottom line is that labor shortages experienced in the aftermath of the pandemic are likely to persist, both in the US and in Europe, where low fertility and aging populations present similar demographic challenges.\nWhile advances in automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence may mitigate some labour-supply challenges, not every job can be replaced by a robot or a computer-generated service. Many of the jobs that remain in demand are in sectors like construction, housekeeping, health care and hospitality, where the work is usually not pleasant or glamorous. If Americans and Europeans are unwilling to take these positions, it makes sense to offer them to motivated, hardworking immigrants. This is not about providing humanitarian assistance; it is just sound economic policy, especially at a time when repeated interest-rate hikes by central banks have not yet resolved one of the primary contributors to inflation: tight labour markets.\nA well-designed immigration policy that allows for the controlled entry of willing workers, and that helps integrate them into host countries, would go a long way toward easing labour-market tightness and preventing humanitarian tragedies caused by smugglers’ shameless exploitation of migrants and refugees. But policymakers will need to look beyond the next election cycle and rise above partisan political interests.\nAt the same time, it is neither possible nor desirable to move the entire populations of low-income countries to America and Europe, so it is imperative to reject short-sighted economic nationalism. Advanced economies must do more to address the huge imbalances that still exist across the world economy. Reducing global inequality is essential to a sustainable future."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5, "end": 19}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 49, "end": 53}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 96, "end": 208}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 183, "end": 206}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 252, "end": 344}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 421, "end": 428}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 478, "end": 504}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 618, "end": 656}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 722, "end": 897}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 722, "end": 786}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 772, "end": 786}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 796, "end": 824}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 900, "end": 1118}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 938, "end": 954}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1204, "end": 1221}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1258, "end": 1288}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1291, "end": 1314}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1317, "end": 1377}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1442, "end": 1467}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 1469, "end": 1613}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1588, "end": 1611}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 1802, "end": 2000}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 2003, "end": 2075}, {"tag": "Red_Herring", "start": 2125, "end": 2204}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 2255, "end": 2385}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2439, "end": 2451}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2535, "end": 2546}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 2665, "end": 2680}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 2713, "end": 2737}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2933, "end": 3001}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3058, "end": 3080}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3135, "end": 3168}], "article_id": "4260", "lang": "en", "text": "'You F------ Idiots': Actress Julianna Margulies Slams Black and LGBTQ Supporters of Palestine\n\nJulianna Margulies recently claimed that Black and LGBTQ+ supporters of Palestine are “brainwashed to hate Jews.”\n\nThe Morning Show star Julianna Margulies recently claimed that Black and LGBTQ+ supporters of Palestine are “brainwashed to hate Jews” amid Israel’s ongoing war against Hamas, RadarOnline.com has learned.\nIn a shocking development to come nearly two months after the Palestinian terrorist group attacked southern Israel from the Gaza Strip on October 7, Margulies appeared on a podcast where she criticized those who refuse to stand up for Israel amid the subsequent war.\nAccording to The Morning Show actress, the Black and LGBTQ+ supporters of Palestine are “f---ing idiots” because “Black” and “gay” individuals would be the “first people beheaded” if they “stepped foot” in Palestine.\n“It’s those kids who are spewing this anti-Semitic hate that have no idea if they stepped foot in an Islamic country […] it’s those people that will be the first people beheaded and their heads played like a soccer ball,” Margulies said on The Back Room with Andy Ostroy podcast.\n“I want to say to them: You f---ing idiots, you don’t exist,” she continued. “You’re even lower than the Jews. You’re Black. You’re gay. You’re turning your back against the people who support you.”\nShe also suggested that those who support Palestine have been “brainwashed to hate Jews.”\n“Because the fact that the entire Black community isn’t standing with us, to me, says they don’t know, or they’ve been brainwashed to hate Jews,” the actress argued.\nMargulies, who plays a gay journalist on The Morning Show, then targeted those in Hollywood who refuse to support Israel amid the country’s war against Hamas in Gaza.\nThe 57-year-old Jewish actress admitted that she was “stunned” by the Hollywood industry and compared the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East to the death of George Floyd in May 2020.\n“Can you imagine the WGA not putting out a statement after George Floyd?” Margulies said. “And yet when it was the Jews – by the way, all of our great material on television is pretty much from the Jews – they stayed silent until they were pressured.”\nAccording to Margulies, the popular social media platform TikTok is to blame for the recent rise in antisemitism across the country.\nShe called for a TikTok ban to curb the number of “crazy people” obtaining their news from the social media site.\n“I guess what’s happening to the crazy people out there who are getting their news from TikTok, which in my estimation – after this whole Osama bin Laden letter – should be banned,” The Good Wife actress said. “TikTok should be banned.”\nAs RadarOnline.com previously reported, several celebrities have come under fire for speaking out about the devastating conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\nScream actress Melissa Barrera was removed from the hit horror franchise after she showed solidarity with Palestine last month, while supermodel Gigi Hadid was forced to apologize this week

Climate Change\n\nRacial redress should be modeled on the global anticolonial tradition of worldbuilding.\n\nReparations have seen a resurgence of interest in recent years, stemming from a variety of sources. Perhaps most familiarly, Ta-Nehisi Coates’s influential 2014 essay in the Atlantic, “The Case for Reparations,” set off a firestorm of reactions across the political spectrum, culminating years later in a “historic” Congressional hearing in 2019. In the wake of George Floyd’s murder and the rebellions of 2020, reparations programs task forces have launched in the city of Detroit and state of California while a housing payment program launched in Evanston. And last year, House Resolution 40—introduced every year in Congress since John Conyers Jr. first introduced it in 1989, and calling for a commission to study reparations for slavery—finally passed through the Judiciary Committee for full consideration on the House floor.\nBut what exactly does the call for reparations demand, and what kind of political movement does it entail? The label has been applied to a vast array of different programs and policies, from direct cash payments to African Americans to symbolic apologies, creations of museums and sites of spiritual recognition, and academic studies about the nature of systemic racism. In a 2016 essay, political scientist Adolph Reed, Jr., took aim at this feature of the call for reparations, describing it as a blend of “material, symbolic, and psychological components.” Reed thinks this ambiguity is a liability, since elites can exploit the demand by choosing the version of reparations that is cheapest for them: the symbolic. More important, Reed contends, overinvestment in symbolic reparations could detract energy and resources from an alternative, preferable political project: “building broad solidarity across race, gender, and other identities around shared concerns of daily life” like “access to quality health care, the right to a decent and dignified livelihood, affordable housing, quality education for all.” Reed thus warns that the call for reparations for some distracts from a more worthy political project that would provide justice for all—an objection also voiced during the 2019 House hearing.\nBut what if the project for reparations was the project for “safer neighborhoods and better schools,” for a “less punitive justice system,” for “the right to a decent and dignified livelihood”? Responding to Reed in Dissent in 2019, African American studies scholar Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor pointed out that the struggle to build a just social system can’t be won solely through “universal” programs addressing common problems. Taylor gives the example of the large disparity rate in maternal mortality between Black mothers and white mothers: the accumulated history of disparate and discriminatory treatment and policy means that not all of the relevant social problems are, in fact, common to both. To build a just health care system, we would have to address both lack of access due to unjust economic structures and lack of access due to unfair gender- and race-based discrimination. From the point of view of building a just health care system, these goals aren’t substitutes for each other; they are complementary.\nThough it is less well elaborated in today’s popular debates, this understanding of reparations—one that sees it as central to the expansive project of building a more just world, not just as a material or symbolic mechanism of redress for past harms—has a long legacy. This vision is worth recovering and integrating with other important political movements today, above all the global struggle for climate justice.\nThere is ample footing, both in theory and in practice, for widening the scope of our conversations about reparations in this way. In his historical study of the Black radical imagination, Freedom Dreams (2002), historian Robin D. G. Kelley notes that the demand for reparations “was never entirely, or even primarily, about money.” Instead, it was about social justice, reconciliation, reconstructing the internal life of black America, and eliminating institutional racism. This is why reparations proposals from black radical movements focus less on individual payments than on securing funds to build autonomous black institutions, improving community life, and in some cases establishing a homeland that will enable African Americans to develop a political economy geared more toward collective needs than toward accumulation.\nThis view—constructive in outlook and global in ambition—has a particularly useful antecedent in midcentury struggles for independence. As historian Adom Getachew shows in her recent book Worldmaking after Empire: The Rise and Fall of Self-Determination (2019), the wave of decolonization movements that crested toward the end of World War II forced new political questions onto the world stage. Prominent figures in the growing global anticolonial movement demanded the institutionalization of self-determination as a political principle of the United Nations, worked to form regional political blocs for mutual aid and uplift, and demanded a New International Economic Order with a different set of rules than the set that had emerged from the interaction of colonial domination and the capitalist economy that emerged from it: what I call “global racial empire.” They imagined new institutions, different relationships between countries, and also, crucially, the most recognizable aspect of reparations politics: redistribution of global wealth, from the First World (back) to the Third World.\nThese activists weren’t just fighting against the structures of colonial domination and racial apartheid; they were also trying to build a more just world on a planetary scale. Unfortunately, they did not succeed: the end of the Cold War, the disciplining of the newly independent states, and the corresponding defeat of radical politics around the globe produced struggles for justice that often set their sights much lower. But any politically serious reparations project—at least one fitting the goals and ethos of the constructive view—should build on this long and worthy tradition of “worldmaking.” It must include two elements, in particular.\nFirst, it must be global in scope. This is not to deny the importance of national or regional struggles for reparations, from the United States to Caribbean nations’ CARICOM Reparations Commission, reparations projects formed on the African continent, and demands from Indigenous groups who have collaborated across their nations to push for redress of grievances. But slavery, colonialism, and the political structure they produced are global phenomena, and we need a global theoretical perspective on what could (and does) unite these separate political projects.\nSecond, and perhaps less obviously, a politically serious reparations project must focus on climate change. The connection between climate crisis, slavery, and colonialism flows from distributions of wealth and vulnerability created by centuries of global politics and its ecological consequences, layered with more recent histories of pollution in the Global North and corporate fossil fuel interests. As climate impacts accelerate, we can expect their burdens to fall disproportionately on those who have been rendered most vulnerable through the accumulated weight of such histories. Our response to climate crisis thus deeply constrains the possibilities for justice.\nThe historical connections between the climate crisis and our present systems of injustice help explain why a just future depends on reparations. Before the rise of global racial empire, different regions of the globe evolved in a fair degree of ecological isolation: ecological connections were constrained by the size and scope of relatively local human economic trade. The newly formed global racial empire exploded in the 1500s and stretched that trade across the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans, comprising what some scholars call the “Columbian exchange”: a historically unprecedented flow of plants, animals, and pathogens into environments that had never dealt with them before. The results were immediate and world-changing. The introduction of European pathogens alongside forms of colonial domination, especially the extensive slave trade in Indigenous populations, led to 56 million deaths in the Americas over the sixteenth century—so many that some scientists estimate that this “Great Dying” cooled the Earth. This was the first anthropogenic global climate event, setting the political stage for the Industrial Revolution. In addition to the unfathomable suffering and loss of life, this catastrophic depopulation of the Americas likely enabled the success of the European campaigns of imperial conquest.\nWhen the Industrial Revolution followed centuries later, human production for the first time outpaced the natural constraints on growth. The British empire, where this process started, was already dominating key parts of the world, including much of the Indian subcontinent. These regimes of exploitation coincided with a crucial bit of geological luck: England had more available coal on its islands than competitors in Europe or South Asia. British industrialists developed techniques to extract and use coal energy to compete with the Indian producers, which lead to new forms of iron production and thus mechanization, crucially in the textile industry that converted cotton from the American South into clothing for the entire world. Coal-powered, mechanized production revolutionized British manufacture and the economic world, helping to complete its dominance as a colonial power. And this aspect of the global racial empire—industrialism—would transform the ecological world.\nAlthough coal was overtaken by oil after the 1950s, the use of oil, coal, and other fossil fuels since the onset of the Industrial Revolution has sent billions of tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The ecological ramifications of these carbon emissions are tremendous. If present trends continue, an estimated one in three humans will—as soon as 2070—be pushed out of the climate niche that our species has inhabited for millennia. In the Global South, sea level rise poses existential threat to the Pacific islands, Bangladesh, and the Nile delta, while drought and agricultural failure leave sub-Saharan Africa on a knife’s edge.\nTo be sure, some aspects of the distribution of climate impacts are purely geographical. Whether or not a family is affected by a hurricane or sea-level rise, for example, depends on how close they live to the ocean. But what matters for our commitment to justice is how these ecological phenomena affect people’s capabilities—the lives that they are or are not empowered to live. In some cases, these geographical variables are themselves deeply shaped by centuries of injustice rather than by personal choices. In other cases, differential distributions of wealth and power today will only exacerbate inequality in the future. Some people who retreat from a coastline will have access to money or credit to manage the financial costs of relocation, a passport or citizenship status that will widen their legal relocation options, and a social status that will make their new communities likely to welcome them. Many others will lack some or all of these advantages: they will be cash-poor and indebted, have a citizenship status that radically curtails their mobility, or a social status that draws stigma and violence. These outcomes aren’t purely geographical; they are shaped by our social and political arrangements.\nWe know that the costs and burdens of environmental catastrophe will be distributed in ways that echo the history of global racial empire because it is already happening. Researchers studying New York City have found that heatwave deaths and even the temperature itself was racially distributed: residents in areas with a larger proportion of white people were wealthier and benefited from the natural cooling of more vegetation as well as the artificial cooling of air conditioners. Meanwhile, what scientists call the “urban heat island effect” put inner-city residents at risk.\nClimate crisis is also likely to lead to new social divisions between those advantaged enough to buy or coerce security from climate impacts and those who cannot. Researchers link recent violence between neighbors in Mali and Nigeria to resource conflicts exacerbated by climate-related desertification and other impacts. At a community, local, and national scale, we can expect police to protect the rich and socially well-positioned, often leaving vulnerable those on the business end of nightsticks or behind cell walls. We can also expect the balance of power between nation states and Indigenous communities to be shaped increasingly by forces of the same kind: the climate crisis is likely to shuffle increasing power and control into the hands of those in command of wealth, coercive force, or strategic resources.\nPutting all this together, the lesson is clear: to understand how the climate crisis will interact with global racial empire’s distribution of advantages and disadvantages, we need to explore the distribution of specifically environmental risk and vulnerability. Various contested economic theories suggest mechanisms for why vulnerabilities are high in the formerly colonized parts of the world, but the distribution of environmental risk and vulnerability can be explained simply in terms of patterns of accumulation.\nAccumulation is the result of distribution over time. If you and I both save ten cents of every dollar we earn over our working lives, we will both end up with accumulated savings by the time we retire. At small scales, the element of choice and responsibility matter: if we both make around the same amount of money from our jobs and have access to similarly consistent hours, then in the end the person with the most retirement funds will be the thriftiest or hardest working of the two of us. However, if I make minimum wage and you make seven figures a year, spending habits or willingness to tack on overtime shifts can never explain the difference between our retirement savings. The distribution of income in our working years, not our work habits, explains the different levels of accumulation we have when we retire. What we can do in our retirement age, how we are cared for, and what we leave to our heirs, likewise, are primarily determined by this distribution. The environmental risk and vulnerability facing countries and populations today emerges from several overlapping strands of political, cultural, and economic accumulation, which were largely set in motion generations ago.\nIn 2005, climate change researchers at the University of East Anglia created an index of eleven key indicators for vulnerability to climate change impacts: percentage of the population with access to sanitation, three measures of literacy rate (by different age groups and by gender), maternal mortality rate, typical caloric intake, civil liberties, political rights, government effectiveness, life expectancy at birth, and a measure of access to justice termed “voice and accountability.”\nSuch measures of climate vulnerability are a useful tool for the constructive view of reparations: what matters about the economy are the actual lives people are empowered to lead. And the measures clearly reveal that the colonizing parts of the world are now much less vulnerable to climate change than the regions they colonized. The measures thus reflect a simple lesson about how yesterday’s distribution affects tomorrow’s reality: heightened vulnerability to the incoming aspects of climate change correlates directly with greater deprivation in the status quo. In short, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. It is not that every aspect of today’s global racial empire is rooted in the impacts of climate change—but every aspect of tomorrow’s global racial empire will be. Climate change will redistribute social advantages in a way that compounds and locks in the distributional injustices we have inherited from history.\nIn the face of these links, what should be done? We don’t have to agree on every aspect of the new world we are building to agree on ways to improve the justice of our current arrangements. At the same time, even in times of immense political opportunity, the possibilities for change are profoundly constrained by the balance of power we inherit from centuries past. As Frederick Douglass noted, “power concedes nothing without a demand.” It is thus imperative to issue clear demands. Here are some places we might start.\n\nUnconditional Cash Transfers\nContemporary demands for reparations have rightly kept focus on this tactic. In stark contrast to the byzantine social support systems that have come to characterize modern social democracies, social scientists are beginning to embrace “unconditional cash transfers”—simply giving people money directly. These kinds of transfers will intervene directly in the patterns of accumulation, one of our most adaptable forms of social advantages. It also avoids the problems with other welfare programs: the sprawling (and questionably efficacious) overhead, the paternalistic attempts to further shape people’s incentives, and the “poverty traps” caused by aid withdrawal once a recipient crosses some threshold of income or welfare. Furthermore, the ethos of the unconditional cash transfer matches self-determination as a goal for reparations policies, which is part and parcel of the constructive view.\nIn their recent book From Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the Twenty-First Century (2020), economist William A. Darity, Jr., and scholar A. Kirsten Mullen endorse a strategy rooted in direct payments to African Americans descended from those enslaved in the United States, disbursed over time rather than all at once (to prevent inflation) and via trust funds and endowments. Moreover, it would be governed by a National Reparations Board that enlists its recipients in research about and decisions over the funds, further bolstering a commitment to an outcome of self-determination. Scholar and organizer Dorian Warren of the Economic Security Project has suggested that we adopt a strategy rooted in “targeted universalism”—a universal basic income for all, plus an additional amount for African Americans to account for the owed reparations. These proposals have been discussed in the context of U.S. politics, but others have suggested a global universal basic income, which could be weighted in the targeted way that Warren suggests. Both of these are exactly the kind of demands we should want to win.\n\nGlobal Climate Funding\nCash transfers directly redistribute social advantages in a powerful way, but they do not directly redistribute disadvantages: including the vulnerability to environmental harm and the burden of climate policy.\nThe Climate Equity Reference Frame is an effort-sharing framework that calculates “fair shares” of the global climate transition effort to individual countries based on their “responsibility” for global emissions and capacity to mobilize resources for reductions in greenhouse emissions given its economic and development needs. Across a variety of ways of calculating “fair share,” poorer countries pledged emissions reductions that greatly exceed their share of climate work while rich counties pledged far less than their share. In fact, poor countries have pledged 50 percent more in reductions than rich countries.\nPart of the reason that richer countries’ reduction pledges lag behind their fair share is because achieving the needed scale of change in a reasonable time frame is technologically difficult. Another approach would be for a richer country to bear the costs of reducing emissions where there are more opportunities for faster emissions reduction.\nThe Green Climate Fund, managed under the existing United Nations Framework on Climate Change, could facilitate such inter-country transfers and provide other support. The rich nations and associated institutions have pledged to raise $100 billion for developing nations’ green development, a step in the right direction. However, Dr. Mariama Williams of the South Centre, an intergovernmental organization supported and staffed by developing countries, claims that this “does not even come close” to what is needed to make significant inroads into the climate crisis. Moreover, the rich countries have failed to follow through on their pledges; the fund stood at a fraction of its goal in early 2020. Both the funding target and the follow-through by richer countries must increase substantially.\nFunding the technology to reduce emissions is crucial, but how do we pay for crises and impacts when they arrive? The United Nations and other intergovernmental organization typically refer to crises—such as those stemming from natural disasters like hurricanes—as “loss and damage.” The question of who should pay for the loss and damage of climate change raises familiar problems in distributive justice: Should rich countries pay because they are richer or because they have emitted more? We can add another: or because they’ve inherited more of the liabilities from global racial empire?\nNo matter how we settle this issue, today’s mechanisms for loss and damage funding shows us what to avoid. Beyond the problem of consistent underfunding, the substantial flow of loans to Third World countries in crisis saddles recipients with debt rather than relief. Debt jubilee could free up vast amounts of public spending in Third World countries toward increasing climate security. Failing that, debt relief for climate finance swaps could reverse this: converting sovereign debt into fuel for climate relief for Third World nations whose money is better spent on climate adaptation than debt service.\n\nTorch the Tax Havens\nFinancing the proposals above will require revamping the financial system locally and globally to prevent elites from hiding and hoarding the world’s wealth, and a crucial component of such a program must involve confronting “tax havens”—sites for the accumulation of wealth, often ill-gotten, which shield wealth holders from taxes. In his book The Hidden Wealth of Nations: The Scourge of Tax Heavens (2015), economist Gabriel Zucman estimates that at least $7.6 trillion of the world’s wealth was held in these offshore accounts. This is surely a low-ball estimate, Zucman notes, since his calculation excludes wealth tied up in real assets (e.g., yachts, jewelry) and circulating in cash, where much of the wealth from drug and other illegal trades is stored. To understand the scale of this mammoth figure, consider that in 2019, the budget for United States’ entire military apparatus—including the Department of Defense, all 17 of its intelligence agencies, its war budget for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, its nuclear weapons program, and veterans affairs expenses—was estimated at $1.25 trillion, less than a fifth of the value of the wealth horded in the world’s tax havens.\nWhile tax havens appear in both the Global North and Global South (Switzerland, Luxembourg, the Cayman Islands, and Ireland, Panama), the overall effect of their distribution has worked out to impoverish Global South countries. Zucman estimates that at least 22 percent of Latin American wealth and 30 percent of African wealth is held offshore, representing tens of billions of dollars of lost tax revenue that could be put to the service of crucial green infrastructure development, just housing, or other pivotal worldbuilding uses. As one advocate of greater control over financial flows reminds us: “For every country losing money illicitly, there is another country absorbing it. Illicit financial outflows are facilitated by financial opacity in tax havens and in Western economies like the United States.” Implementing transparency measures to curtail tax haven secrecy and anonymous shell companies is crucial to curtailing illicit flows.\n\nDivest-Invest, from Fossil Fuels to Communities\nFossil fuel divestment campaigns often aim to move capital from problematic fossil fuel corporations to more “climate responsible investments.” On the view of climate justice developed here, green investments in Black and Indigenous communities are climate- responsible investments. We ought to think of fossil fuel companies like we think of police, as generators of insecurity, and make similar efforts to divert resources from them back into looted communities. The divest–invest framework in both of these divestment campaigns ought to aim for this same pattern of redistribution.\nSome might be skeptical: divestment campaigns don’t seem to work. . . . until they do. When they reach a tipping “threshold,” they can have sudden and dramatic effects. Each institution that divests poses limited financial risks for investors, but each additional divesting corporation increases the difficult-to-quantify reputational risks that could trigger wider scale (and more consequential) market movement. A group consisting of fewer than ten percent of investors, according to simulations, could trigger a systemwide redistribution of social resources away from fossil fuels.\nSocial movements can also be “tipped” in this way. In 2014 youth runners went on hundred- or even thousand-mile runs, spreading news of an incoming pipeline by word of mouth. Hundreds, then thousands, answered the call and camped around the Standing Rock Indian Reservation to defend the Indigenous territory from the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline being attempted the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Standing Rock was one battle in a larger confrontation; similar campaigns were being waged at the same time and continue around the world now—from residents in Appalachia opposing Dominion Energy’s pipelines through their communities to the Kenyan environmental activists mobilized against construction of a Chinese-financed coal-fired energy plant on the island of Lamu.\nAnyone within a stone’s throw of an institution that is invested in fossil fuels—a state or national government, a university, even a company—can start or join a divestment movement, or oppose the construction or expansion of environmentally and socially harmful production. You can also demand that the divested social resources be invested in and by Black, Indigenous, and other colonized communities.\n\nDeciding Together\nA question that is equally pressing for grassroots struggle and the formal halls of power is how to debate, prioritize, and act on these and other proposals. In much of the world today, representative democracy is plagued by elite capture: the manipulation of public institutions and resources by the most advantaged and well-positioned, often to the detriment of everyone else. As if that’s not bad enough, many of the approaches to combating this very kind of injustice, including valorization of and organizing around marginalized identities, are likewise vulnerable to elite capture.\nA better alternative than reliance on representative institutions is to emphasize the distribution of power itself. Energy researcher Johanna Bozuwa provides a helpful example in her summary of the work of many activists and community organizations, which she calls “energy democracy.” Community control over the generation, transportation, and distribution of energy would shift the incentives governing how those important social advantages—as well as the associated disadvantages, such as pollution—are controlled and managed. Publicly owned utilities are no radical pipedream, even in the United States: they already serve small cities like Hammond, Wisconsin, and big ones like Los Angeles, California, and Nashville, Tennessee. But beyond public ownership of energy, protection from elite capture is key to the pursuit of climate justice. Community-level decision making and control of public utilities must be the goal.\nIt is not enough to say that we should listen to the voices of marginalized peoples in making decisions and controlling climate initiatives. Each of us will have to decide, after all, which specific perspectives of many we want to support. We shouldn’t expect that process to be easy or without controversy. Groups including Indigenous-led Red Nation, Cooperation Jackson in predominantly Black Mississippi, and the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance have each issued carefully developed statements offering broad direction as to what climate justice looks like in action. But the devil is often in the details.\nIdentity issues further complicate an equally fundamental problem: the formal structures we have to work with are not well suited to respond to global problems. Environmental policy professor Michael Méndez details how a policy proposal for California to purchase “carbon offsets” split Indigenous groups in Brazil, with representatives from larger groups with legally recognized land like the Yawanawa speaking in favor of the proposal, and representatives from forest communities like the Apurina and Jaminawa speaking against. Whatever decisions lawmakers make, none of these people, who live in Brazil, voted for the California legislators, and none of them are in a position to vote them out. As Méndez argues, we may need new “trans-local” ways of acting and thinking across largely different geographic and political contexts, ways that emphasize the importance of community-level decision making and impacts.\n\nSome might worry about the scope of this constructive view of reparations. They might think that a global focus on reparations as “worldmaking,” linked with international struggles against climate injustice, could distract from more specific campaigns. But it is no coincidence that the civil rights movement and the decolonization of more than 100 nations all occurred simultaneously in the decades following World War II: each of these struggles made the others more likely to succeed, not less. Attempting to prevent rather than join up with other group’s efforts stems from understandable motivations but is ultimately self-defeating.\nOthers could worry about the content of a constructive reparations program rather than its scope: that such a way of thinking about reparations will distract us from bread-and-butter reparations demands, like direct transfers of money to individuals and families or reconciliation processes. But this worry is misguided. The constructive view is all-encompassing: it would unequivocally support cash transfers to African Americans, for example, and reforms to education to facilitate more honest teaching and relationships around the history of slavery and colonialism. The constructive view is not a replacement for these, but a particular understanding of what they aim to accomplish: changing our social environment for the better. This framework simply identifies opportunities for reconstruction that include and go beyond these, linking the important need for cash and memorials to equally important issues, from addressing the destructive role of prisons and pollutants to building food and energy systems that protect us all. And indeed, in a world increasingly ravaged by climate catastrophe, the time is long overdue to forge a political movement equal to the scope of that planetary challenge.

Cory Gardner (R-CO) remains silent on whether President Donald Trump withheld military assistance to Ukraine — a country actively fighting a Russian-backed insurgency — to try to force an investigation into a political rival, but during a hearing today on the U.S. policy toward Russia, Gardner called Russian President Vladimir Putin a “thug” and urged the State Department to officially list the country as a “state sponsor of terror.”\n“We know that Russia supports terrorist groups,” Gardner, a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, charged during a hearing on Tuesday.\nGardner renewed his call to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism, citing its invasion of Ukraine, support for authoritarian regimes in Syria and Iran, and responsibility for multiple chemical-based attacks against individuals that they perceived to be threats as evidence.\nEarlier this year, Gardner introduced the Stopping Malign Activities from Russian Terrorism Act with the committee’s ranking member Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ). The bill would require the Secretary of State to submit a report to Congress within 90 days of passage on whether Russia fits the criteria to be designated as a state sponsor of terrorism.\nIn April, Gardner penned an op-ed that laid out the “moral case” for the designation. If the State Department concludes that it should label Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism, it would, among other things, place significant restrictions on foreign aid and military equipment.\n“We must take every diplomatic step necessary to protect our allies and our democracy, and to deter a revanchist Russia that is intent on rewriting history and threatening our way of life,” Gardner wrote.\nDespite the tough talk on Russia, including his condemnation of the Ukraine invasion, Gardner has mostly refrained from criticizing Trump policies and statements on Russia, including, most recently, Trump’s re-stated and debunked contention that Ukraine intervened in the U.S. election, when, in fact, Russia promoted the hoax of Ukrainian meddling to conceal Russia’s own meddling.\nAnother point of contention Gardner raised during the hearing was Russian aggression toward NATO allies and the Baltic states — which were previously under Soviet control.\nAccording to the global policy think tank RAND, Russian forces are capable of reaching the capitals of countries like Estonia and Latvia within 60 hours. Lawmakers from both parties called on the Trump administration also to impose sanctions on Turkey — a NATO ally — after it purchased a Russian missile defense system just days before the upcoming NATO summit in London.\nGardner argued that Russia is “clearly an adversary,” and called on the committee to consider a bill that was dubbed the “sanctions bill from hell.” A bipartisan bill introduced earlier this year in the committee would target Putin and the Russian economy in response to their meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the backing of separatist movements in Ukraine, and supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\nThe bill would attempt to institutionalize U.S. support for NATO by imposing limits on the president from unilaterally withdrawing from the military alliance. Still, Gardner called on European allies to increase their burden-sharing in curbing Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.\nGardner has acknowledged that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election, unlike some of his Republican colleagues.\n“[Russia] is engaged in active information warfare against western democracies, including meddling in the United States’ election in 2016,” Gardner said. Russia, he added, is “clearly an adversary and [continues] to intend to do that in 2020.”"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 59, "end": 275}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 144, "end": 187}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 384, "end": 701}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 388, "end": 415}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 638, "end": 654}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 892, "end": 1166}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1306, "end": 1322}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1588, "end": 1739}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 1742, "end": 2015}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 2018, "end": 2228}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2231, "end": 2481}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 2484, "end": 2891}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2990, "end": 3091}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3041, "end": 3049}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3094, "end": 3360}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4056, "end": 4384}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 4436, "end": 4590}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4593, "end": 4824}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 5109, "end": 5293}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5333, "end": 5345}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 5923, "end": 6269}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6148, "end": 6168}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 6733, "end": 6938}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 7084, "end": 7196}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 7198, "end": 7400}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 7981, "end": 8102}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 8389, "end": 8611}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 8785, "end": 9109}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 9312, "end": 9622}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 9315, "end": 9408}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 9934, "end": 10059}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 10202, "end": 10276}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 10279, "end": 10387}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 10326, "end": 10334}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 10377, "end": 10385}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 10440, "end": 10592}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 10524, "end": 10537}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 10594, "end": 10872}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 10644, "end": 10658}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 10708, "end": 10724}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 11197, "end": 11262}], "article_id": "4265", "lang": "en", "text": "A Tale of Two Walls\n\nCongress prefers the Israeli version\n\nThe demand of President Donald Trump that congress should appropriate money to build a wall securing the nation’s southern border has resulted in the longest federal government shutdown in history with no end in sight. There is considerable opposition to the wall based on two quite different perceptions of border security. The generally “progressive” view is that there is no border threat at all, that the thousands of migrants heading for the U.S. can be assimilated and indeed should be allowed entry because of U.S. government policies in Central America that have created the ruined states that the would-be immigrants have been fleeing.\nThere is certainly some truth to that argument, though it suggests that the United States should essentially abandon sovereignty over its own territory, which most Americans would reject. The alternative viewpoint, which has a much broader bipartisan constituency, consists of those who do feel that border security is a national priority but are nevertheless critical of building a wall, which will be expensive, possibly ineffective and environmentally damaging. They prefer other options, to include increased spending on the border guards, more aggressive enforcement against existing illegals and severe punishment of businesses in the U.S. that hire anyone not possessing legal documentation. Some also have argued in favor of a national ID issued only to citizens or legal permanent residents that would have to be produced by anyone seeking employment or government services.\nWhether the wall will ever be built is questionable, but one thing that is certain is that there is more than enough hypocrisy regarding it to go around. Democratic Presidents including Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when campaigning have called for better border security, as have Democratic Congressional leaders who are now smelling blood and attacking Trump for seeking to do what they have long at least theoretically sought.\nApart from that, many of the Democrats who are currently criticizing the southern border wall on moral grounds have failed to apply the same standard to another infamous wall, that which is being built by Israel. Israel’s “separation wall” is arguably being constructed at least in part using “aid” and charitable money provided by Washington while also being enabled politically by the U.S. government’s acquiescence to the Israeli violations of international law. And if the moral argument for not having a wall to aid suffering refugees has any meaning, it would be many times more so applied to the Israeli wall, which is an instrument in the maintenance of apartheid in areas under Israeli control while also making permanent the stateless status of the more than one million Palestinian refugees, far more in number than the would-be immigrants marching through Mexico.\nThe Israeli wall is at many points larger and more intimidating than that planned by Trump, and it is also designed to physically and economically devastate the Palestinian population adjacent to it. Israel’s wall is undeniably far more damaging than anything being considered for placement along the U.S.-Mexican border as it operates as both a security measure and a tool for confiscating more Arab land by including inside the barrier illegal West Bank settlements.\nThere are both physical similarities and differences relating to the two walls. Judging from prototypes, Trump currently appears to favor prefabricated mostly metal sections with barbed wire coils on top that would be high and intimidating enough to deter climbing over. The sections would be set in foundations sufficiently deep to deter most tunneling and there would be sensors at intervals to alert guards to other attempts to penetrate the barrier. Israel’s wall varies in terms of structural material, including large concrete blocks 28 feet high in some areas while other less populated stretches that are considered low security make do with multiple lines of barbed wire and sensors. It is interesting to note that some Israeli companies have apparently expressed interest in building the Mexico wall and, as one of the many perks Israel receives from congress includes the right to bid on U.S. government contracts, they might well wind up as a contractors or subcontractors if the barrier is ever actually built.\nAs noted above, the principal difference between the U.S. wall and that of Israel is that the American version is all on U.S. land and is engineered to more or less run in a straight line along the border. The Israeli version is nearly 90% built on Palestinian land and, as it is designed to create facts on the West Bank, it does not run in a straight line, instead closing off some areas to the Palestinians by surrounding Arab villages. It therefore keeps people in while also keeping people out, so it is not strictly speaking a security barrier. Indeed, some Israeli security experts have stated their belief that the wall has been only a minor asset in preventing violence directed by Palestinians against Israelis.\nIf the Israeli wall had followed the Green Line that separated Israel proper from Palestinian land it would be only half the estimated 440 miles long that it will now be upon completion. The extra miles are accounted for by the deep cuts of as much as 11 miles into the West Bank, isolating about 9% of it and completely enclosing 25,000 Palestinian Arabs from areas nominally controlled by the Palestinian Authority. One often cited victim of the barrier is the Palestinian town of Qalqilyah, with a population of 45,000, which is enclosed on all sides by a wall that in some sections measures more than 25 feet high. Qalqilyah is only accessible through an Israeli controlled military checkpoint on the main road from the east and a tunnel on the south side that links the town to the adjacent village of Habla.\nThe wall is therefore only in part a security measure while also being a major element in the Israeli plan to gradually acquire as much of the West Bank as possible – perhaps all of it – for Israeli settlers. It is a form of collective punishment based on religion to make life difficult for local people and eventually drive them from their homes.\nThe human costs for the Palestinians have consequently been high. A United Nations 2005 report states that : … it is difficult to overstate the humanitarian impact of the Barrier. The route inside the West Bank severs communities, people’s access to services, livelihoods and religious and cultural amenities. In addition, plans for the Barrier’s exact route and crossing points through it are often not fully revealed until days before construction commences. This has led to considerable anxiety amongst Palestinians about how their future lives will be impacted… The land between the Barrier and the Green Line constitutes some of the most fertile in the West Bank. It is currently the home for 49,400 West Bank Palestinians living in 38 villages and towns.”\nAmnesty International in a 2004 report observed: “The fence/wall, in its present configuration, violates Israel’s obligations under international humanitarian law… Since the summer of 2002 the Israeli army has been destroying large areas of Palestinian agricultural land, as well as other properties, to make way for a fence/wall which it is building in the West Bank. In addition to the large areas of particularly fertile Palestinian farmland that have been destroyed, other larger areas have been cut off from the rest of the West Bank by the fence/wall. The fence/wall is not being built between Israel and the Occupied Territories but mostly (close to 90%) inside the West Bank, turning Palestinian towns and villages into isolated enclaves, cutting off communities and families from each other, separating farmers from their land and Palestinians from their places of work, education and health care facilities and other essential services. This in order to facilitate passage between Israel and more than 50 illegal Israeli settlements located in the West Bank.”\nOf course, the situation has become far worse for Palestinians since the two reports dating from 2004 and 2005. Israel has accelerated its settlement construction and the wall has expanded and shifted to accommodate those changes, making life impossible for the indigenous population.\nAny pushback from the United States has been rare to nonexistent, with successive administrations only occasionally mentioning that the settlements themselves are “troubling” or a “complication” vis-à-vis a peace settlement. The first direct criticism of the wall itself took place in 2003, when the Bush administration briefly considered reducing loan guarantees to discourage its construction. Then Secretary of State Colin Powell remarked “A nation is within its rights to put up a fence if it sees the need for one. However, in the case of the Israeli fence, we are concerned when the fence crosses over onto the land of others.”\nOn May 25, 2005, Bush repeated his concerns, noting that “I think the wall is a problem. And I discussed this with Ariel Sharon. It is very difficult to develop confidence between the Palestinians and Israel with a wall snaking through the West Bank.” In a letter to Sharon he stated that it “should be a security rather than political barrier, should be temporary rather than permanent and therefore not prejudice any final status issues including final borders, and its route should take into account, consistent with security needs, its impact on Palestinians not engaged in terrorist activities.”\nCongress is, of course, Israeli occupied territory so its response was directed against Powell and Bush in support of anything Israel chose to do. Then Senator Joe Lieberman complained “The administration’s threat to cut aid to Israel unless it stops construction of a security fence is a heavy-handed tactic. The Israeli people have the right to defend themselves from terrorism, and a security fence may be necessary to achieve this.”\nIn 2005, Senator Hillary Clinton declared her support for the wall by claiming that the Palestinian Authority had failed to fight terrorism. “This is not against the Palestinian people. This is against the terrorists. The Palestinian people have to help to prevent terrorism. They have to change the attitudes about terrorism.” Senator Charles Schumer, also from New York, added “As long as the Palestinians send terrorists onto school buses and to nightclubs to blow up people, Israel has no choice but to build the Security Wall.”\nSo, for many in Washington a legal and relatively apolitical wall by the United States to protect its border is a horrible prospect while the Israeli version built on someone else’s land with the intention to damage the local Arab population as much as possible is perfectly fine. The reality is that America’s Establishment, which is dominated by veneration of Israel for a number of reasons, is completely hypocritical, more prepared to criticize actions taken by the United States even when those actions are justified than they are to condemn Israeli actions that amount to crimes against humanity.

But it’s hard to feel jubilant with so many hostages — including Americans — remaining in captivity, Hamas getting rewarded for abominable behavior, and the sense that Hamas has a new way to pressure Israel by dangling the release of more hostages and adding new demands. Fifteen minutes into the ceasefire, someone fired a rocket at Israel from Gaza and the world barely noticed; no one really expects Hamas to uphold its end of the agreement. Go figure — barbarians who massacre unarmed civilians and use rape as a weapon of war aren’t the kind of people you can trust at the negotiating table.\r\nIt is good that so far, roughly 60 of the estimated 240 hostages held by Hamas have been released. Their captivity sounds horrific — held underground for seven weeks, barely fed, sleeping on chairs, and denied the ability to go to the bathroom for hours; some in need of medical care, including one elderly woman in life-threatening condition — and anything that relieves their suffering is a step in the right direction. But, as some warned, under the terms of the agreement, Hamas now can determine how much longer the pause in fighting continues. Israel agreed that for every ten additional hostages released, its forces would continue the cease-fire for another day.\r\nOn paper, this is a good incentive structure designed to maximize the number of hostages released. In practice, this means Hamas can always dangle the potential release of some of the estimated 180 remaining hostages and then drag its feet in actually releasing them. On Saturday, the second round of releases was delayed for about eight hours because Hamas accused Israel of not delivering trucks of humanitarian aid.\r\nBut that evening, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs confirmed that “sixty-one trucks hauled aid to northern Gaza on Saturday — the largest number since 7 October. . . . Eleven ambulances, 3 coaches and a flatbed were delivered to Al Shifa hospital to be used to assist with evacuations. Also on Saturday, another 200 trucks were dispatched from Nitzana, with 187 of them successfully entering Gaza by 19:00 local time.”\r\nWhat happens if, as the deadline approaches, Hamas offers to release nine hostages instead of the previously agreed ten? Or eight, or five, or just one? Is Israel willing to restart the fighting when there is an offer of a released hostage on the table? How will the families of the hostages respond? How will Israeli society respond?\r\nThe Associated Press, this morning: Two Egyptian officials said talks are aimed at extending the cease-fire for another four days, with one saying that both sides have agreed in principle. But that official added that violence in the occupied West Bank is complicating matters, with Hamas demanding an end to Israeli military raids. Hundreds of Palestinians have been arrested and scores killed in clashes with Israeli forces since the war began.\r\nThe original terms of the deal didn’t specify anything about what Israel could or could not do in the West Bank.\r\nIsrael contends that Hamas also broke its promise to release parents and children together: Kibbutz Be’eri, where 12 of the 13 hostages released last night were kidnapped from on October 7, says that while the community was “happy and excited” about the return of the hostages, Hamas violated the terms of the deal when it released 13-year-old Hila Rotem without her mother, Raya... Also released last night were 17-year-old Noam Or and his 13-year-old sister, Alma. Their mother Yonat was murdered by terrorists on October 7, and their father Dror remains hostage in Gaza, along with his 18-year-old nephew Liam.\r\nNote that roughly 15 minutes after the cease-fire went into effect, someone — perhaps Hamas, perhaps some other anti-Israel terror group like Palestinian Islamic Jihad — fired a rocket into Israel. Thankfully, it was intercepted; Israel did not treat it as a violation of the terms of the agreement.\r\nHamas’s modus operandi is clear: Look for any conceivable reason to claim the Israelis aren’t upholding their end of the agreement, and then use that as an excuse to break its own promises and/or make further demands.\r\nThis is not merely an Israeli problem. There are ten Americans, including one legal resident, who are unaccounted for; some of these Americans are believed to be held by Hamas. Yesterday, President Biden’s national-security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on CBS News’ Face the Nation, “I have every confidence that ultimately, all of the Americans and all of the individuals being held hostage will come home. We are determined not to rest until that happens.”\r\nYou may have noticed that you haven’t heard much about these ten unaccounted-for Americans. You could make an argument that saturation coverage of these hostages, with yellow ribbons and all the rest, would increase the leverage of Hamas and increase pressure on the Biden administration to offer concessions to it. But if that is the philosophy at work in the relatively low-key coverage of American hostages, it is exceptionally convenient for the administration and the president, whose job-approval rating is at 38.9 percent.\r\nAs of 2 a.m. Eastern this morning, the coordinator for the hostages and missing in the Israeli prime minister’s office issued a statement declaring, “Discussions are being held on the list that was received overnight and which is now being evaluated in Israel.” In other words, negotiations with Hamas are ongoing. When the deadline arrives, will the Israelis be willing to get up from the table and restart military operations? Or will there be too much pressure to make more concessions to get at least a few more hostages released?\r\nThe mission of either destroying or incapacitating Hamas is far from finished. David Horovitz of the Times of Israel offers a grim assessment of how much work remains: For now, it would seem, seven weeks into the Israeli effort to tear it apart, Hamas seems to be holding together quite effectively. The best estimate is that perhaps 4,000-5,000 of its gunmen are dead; that leaves another 20,000-25,000 who are not. Israel controls much of northern Gaza, and has destroyed much of Hamas’s infrastructure there, but most of the Hamas tunnel network in the north may well still be intact. According to former generals including Amos Yadlin, Yisrael Ziv and Giora Eiland, the ground operation is certainly not even half-completed, with central and southern Gaza yet to be tackled, notably including Hamas strongholds such as Khan Younis. And the logistics of fighting in southern Gaza, now unprecedentedly populated with its own residents and hundreds of thousands of evacuees from the north, will present immense challenges to the IDF, even as almost all of the international community steps up pressure for a permanent ceasefire.\r\nOver at the United Nations this weekend, our ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, pointed out the obvious: that the U.N. has quickly forgotten about what started the war, and shows no desire to hold Hamas accountable for its war crimes: It has been less than two months since Hamas carried out its barbaric terrorist attack against Israel, but many members of this Council seem to have forgotten or attempted to erase the horrors of that day. And many still cannot bring themselves to unequivocally condemn Hamas’ acts of terror. So, I feel an obligation to speak on these horrors lest we forget. It is outrageous and it is an insult to the victims of Hamas’ brutal attack. The children who were executed in front of their parents. The families who were burned alive. The young people who were gunned down with glee. We have also seen horrifying footage that points to Hamas’ rape and sexual assault of innocent civilians. Where is the universal condemnation? And where is the outrage?\r\nAt National Review today, Danielle Pletka, a distinguished senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, asks just what the point of U.S. membership in the United Nations is, if the institution is forever going to give a pass to terrorist groups like Hamas: Doubtless there are useful things that happen at the United Nations, though it takes some effort to conjure up their impact — whether in Syria, where half a million died with barely a murmur from the international body’s leadership; in North Korea, where millions have died at the hands of a brutal dictatorship; in Xinjiang, where a million Uyghur Muslim Chinese remain in Communist concentration camps, suffering the silence of the world’s most important human-rights bodies; or in Ukraine, where a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council preys on a sovereign state’s land. Sure, the U.N.’s structure insulates the Security Council’s five permanent members from attack. But then, is it not right to ask what exactly the U.N. does for human freedom, or, more practically speaking, for the U.S. taxpayer? Hating Israel and exonerating tyrants is hardly in the best interests of American foreign policy. Perhaps it’s time to stop paying the U.N. as if it actually serves American interests in any way, because it doesn’t.\r\nElsewhere at NR, our Haley Strack is observing the “U.N. Women’s 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence” by spotlighting 15 women’s organizations that have either supported Hamas’s violence against Israeli women or remained silent on it. Today’s offering is on the so-called Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund: The Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund (WPHF) is a financing arm of the United Nations that funds local women’s organizations worldwide.

But considering some 5,000 Palestinians live in each square kilometre in Gaza, these hospitals can’t accommodate all cases,” he said.\nA lack of coronavirus testing kits and personal protective equipment (PPE) is also complicating the fight, as Israel continues to impose restrictions on medical supplies reaching Gaza.\nGaza has been under a tight land, air and sea siege for more than 13 years by Israel and Egypt, cutting it off from the rest of the world. Early hopes that Gaza’s isolation would spare it from the pandemic were dashed as the densely populated coastal region came under severe threat with a dilapidated healthcare system that is unable to handle the onslaught of patients.\nOn August 24, only four Palestinians were reported to have been infected with the virus in the Gaza Strip. As of Monday, 14,768 people had contracted COVID-19, with 65 deaths. The number of critical cases stands at 79.\n\n‘Imminent catastrophe’\nOfficials say Israel’s siege is a death sentence for Gaza’s COVID-19 patients.\n“The Gaza Strip lacks oxygen-generating machines, ventilators, protective gear, and hygiene materials,” said Dr Basim Naim, head of international relations in the Hamas-led government.\n“Thirty-two percent of basic drugs and 62 percent of drugs and materials for medical laboratories are not available.”\nThe former minister of health called on the international community and aid agencies to immediately intervene to stop the “imminent catastrophe”, accusing Israel of restricting the entry of medical supplies under “the pretext of security”.\n“Hamas’ leadership will not accept the death of the Palestinian people either by starving or by leaving them to die by the pandemic,” said Naim. “We call on the international community to provide us with the financial resources needed to purchase all necessary items to combat the virus.”\nSalama Marouf, head of the government’s information office, underscored the need to bring life-saving ventilators into Gaza. He added that “all measures are on the table now, including a full lockdown” to get infections under control.\nOfficials say despite Egyptian mediation, Israeli still refuses to allow ventilators into Gaza, making granting that permission conditional upon the return of soldiers’ bodies kept by Hamas since the 2014 Israeli war on Gaza.\nThe Gaza Strip – a 100km-long (45-mile) coastal area home to more than 2.1 million Palestinians – was one of the last regions to be hit by COVID-19 worldwide.\nBut many people here ignored advice to wear masks, held large wedding parties and protests against Israel’s occupation, and continue to socialise at mass gatherings.\nAbuwarda highlighted the “lack of commitment” among Palestinians when it comes to wearing masks, social distancing, and practising proper hygiene. “We must count on people’s awareness to stop the spread of the virus,” he said.\n\nDrastic measures\nThe influx of coronavirus patients into regular hospitals also threatens those with other illnesses.\n“These hospitals are not fully prepared to deal with COVID-19 patients and will negatively impact the medical service provided to normal patients,” said Naim.\nMany Palestinians were in favour of the government taking drastic measures to curb the rapid spread of coronavirus.\nBut some officials say they cannot impose a general lockdown as people’s minimum essential needs would go unmet because of the deteriorated state of the economy.\nAhmad Abu Mustapha, 35, an electrical equipment shop owner, called on the government to apply a full lockdown to “help save lives” even if it inflicts economic pain.\n“We fear for ourselves, our families and children. We want a full lockdown even if this harms us economically,” said Mustapha.\nJournalist Hassan Islayih, 32, agreed on the need to shut down movement in the Gaza Strip, noting “people’s awareness is not as it should be”.\n“Today the situation is dangerous.

But several observations already stand out.\n\nOn the morning of Oct. 7, the Palestinian militant group Hamas carried out a massive attack on Israel that was nearly unprecedented in its scale and scope. Hamas fired rockets from Gaza and infiltrated its operatives across the border, where they engaged in firefights at seven different locations in southern Israel, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). At least 250 Israelis have been killed, and that number is expected to rise, with over 1,400 more wounded, including at least 18 injured critically and 267 in serious condition. Hamas has also reportedly taken dozens of Israelis hostage, releasing video to support its claims.\nInitial information suggests that the attack has no precedent in recent Israeli history. The IDF said approximately 2,200 rockets were launched in the initial barrages, making it the largest rocket attack against Israel since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007. The number of rockets launched was an order of magnitude larger than the attacks at the beginning of the 2014 and 2021 crises. Hamas also appears to have been quite innovative, using paragliders among other means to enter Israel by surprise. The infiltration is particularly devastating for Israel due to the lives lost and the hostages taken.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared, “We are at war,” and launched Operation Iron Swords, conducting airstrikes in Gaza and calling up reservists. Al Jazeera reports that the Israeli response has already claimed 232 lives in Gaza, with many more deaths sure to come.\nThe situation is chaotic, and the fighting is ongoing—the ultimate numbers of dead, wounded, and hostages may be far greater than initial reports. Undoubtedly, early information is incomplete, exaggerated in some areas and understated in others, and in some cases plain wrong. But several observations stand out.\n\n1. Hamas was at a dead end.\nHamas has governed Gaza since seizing power there in 2007, and it has always wrestled with the inherent tension between governing the area and maintaining its bona fides as the leader of the anti-Israel resistance camp among Palestinians. Hamas has done so in the face of Israeli and international opposition; tremendous economic pressure that Israel increases or eases to incentivize peace behavior from Hamas; and bitter efforts by its rival, the Palestinian Authority, led by Mahmoud Abbas.\nFor much of the last 16 years, Hamas’s leaders have tried to appeal to Palestinians by showing that they, not the PA, can better govern. And in some ways, they succeeded. Despite international economic isolation, Hamas provides services such as trash collection and law enforcement far more effectively than its PA predecessors in Gaza. Hamas also presented itself as less corrupt than PA leaders, not a difficult argument to make.\nYet Hamas sees itself as a resistance organization and needs to be one politically. Part of this is because its record of governance of Gaza is spotty. Gazans lead difficult lives, with high unemployment and poverty abounding. Hamas’s ability to claim leadership based on the quality of ordinary Palestinians’ lives is limited.\nAt the same time, Hamas’s leaders see Israel as illegitimate and hostile. They believe that attacking Israel is justified and that, in the end, they can gain politically from doing so. They know that ordinary Gazans will pay a terrible price from the Israeli response, but they hope that the eventual political settlement will be in their favor.\nEven if it is simply some variation of the status quo, they aim to gain political points (and by implication discredit the PA) by showing that they, not the PA, are standing up to Israel. They can also shore up support among more extreme elements of their own organization and potential rivals such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which have chafed at what they see as the inaction of Hamas’s leadership.\n\n2. The PA is caught in a Catch-22.\nThe PA is caught in a political trap, wanting to see Hamas fail but unable to openly cheer for Israel. The PA claims to represent all Palestinians, a stance that is incompatible with Hamas’s independent power in Gaza. Abbas and other PA leaders have implicitly supported the isolation of Gaza, and its security forces have worked closely with Israel to crush Hamas in the West Bank, often acting brutally in the process. (Hamas has returned the favor, targeting PA supporters in Gaza.)\nToday, the PA suffers from a legitimacy crisis. With the collapse of the peace process, the PA has no way to tell ordinary Palestinians that they have a path to an independent state. The unchecked growth of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, pogroms by Israeli settlers, and the open contempt many members of Netanyahu’s coalition have for Palestinians all increase the PA’s humiliation. Abbas himself is 87 years old and inspires little love among Palestinians. When he finally moves on, chaos may engulf the PA, with Hamas further increasing its influence.\nFor ordinary Palestinians, especially those who are not in the line of fire, Hamas’s attack may come with some sense of satisfaction, showing that Israelis will pay a price if they ignore Palestinian rights. Skepticism of peace talks and of Israeli intentions was high among Palestinians before the latest fighting. As a result, the PA, in public, will continue to criticize Israel, especially as large numbers of Palestinians die in the Israeli response, even though it hopes that Israel will crush Hamas and that the organization will be even weaker.\n\n3. The attack represents a massive Israeli intelligence failure.\nAlthough tensions had been high for some time, with warnings of a Third Intifada common, the scale of this attack caught Israel, as well as outside observers, by surprise. Israeli officials are already saying this was a massive intelligence failure.\nTactically, Israel was not prepared for Hamas’s ability to infiltrate fighters across the border and otherwise conduct a large-scale operation under Israel’s nose. The attack was also a surprise strategically, with Israel not prepared for such a dramatic escalation in fighting. And the timing of the attack will only compound the embarrassment, as it occurred almost to the day of the 50th anniversary of the surprise attack that began the 1973 Arab-Israeli War—perhaps the biggest intelligence failure in Israel’s history.\nUndoubtedly, investigations into this intelligence failure will seek answers as to why Israel’s famously skilled security services were caught by surprise. One reason may be a degree of complacency on the part of Israeli leaders. The Palestinian issue seemed to be successfully managed for many years, with Israel’s strong response to any flare-ups ensuring that Hamas quickly sought negotiations. Iron Dome and other systems seem to effectively protect Israelis from rockets and mortars from Gaza, while the barrier along the border with Gaza meant infiltration was seemingly impossible.\nIsraelis may also have underestimated Hamas’s counterintelligence, believing that the group would not learn from its past failures. Yet observers have long warned that the Palestinian situation was boiling over and that an unrepentant Hamas was seeking to turn the tables on Israel.\nThe attack—with its high number of dead and wounded as well as numerous hostages—also represents a major failure for the Netanyahu government. This is a particular problem in the Israeli political context, as Netanyahu has sold himself as a politician who can lead the fight against terrorism, force the Palestinians to bend to his will, and be tough on security.\nThe fighting comes at a time when Netanyahu is facing other significant challenges. His efforts to greatly weaken the power of Israel’s Supreme Court led to mass protests, and he himself has been indicted for bribery, fraud, and breach of trust. He has a core of supporters, but he cannot afford damage to his security credentials. In addition, he relies on an extreme right-wing government, with several openly racist ministers who have long called for tougher treatment of the Palestinians, especially when violence occurs.\n\n4. The hostage drama will dramatically complicate the situation.\nIn addition to the high death toll, one of the hardest things for Israel to handle will be the hostages whom Hamas has taken. In the past, Israel had bargained for years to return its people—and even their dead bodies—in the possession of its enemies. In 2011, for example, the Netanyahu government exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas in 2006.\nThe hostages Hamas has taken will be powerful bargaining chips, as they give Hamas the option to respond to Israeli military action by threatening to harm or actually harming or killing the hostages. The hostages’ presence in Gaza also puts countervailing pressures on Israeli political and military leaders. The attack has already triggered a large-scale military response, but retrieving the hostages alive will be more likely with smaller-scale actions such as negotiations or special forces operations.\n\n5. Expect a tough Israeli response.\nIsrael’s initial response has involved targeting Hamas rocket and missile facilities in Gaza as well as trying to round up Hamas infiltrators and prevent additional militants from entering Israel—a daunting set of tasks.\nIsrael will try to restore shreds of deterrence by showing Hamas that it will pay a heavy price for its actions. For now, the attack on Israel will be seen by many Israelis and Palestinians as a win for Hamas. Because the Palestinian group is so much weaker than Israel, its ability to strike—and with such deadly effect—is impressive, even if the Israeli response in the end is far more devastating. Israel prioritizes deterrence, not only to stop Hamas from attacking but also to counter Hezbollah, Iran, and other adversaries, as its leaders believe that weakness on one front spreads to other areas.\nWhen Israel fought Hezbollah in 2006, Hezbollah’s continued attacks and killing of more than 100 Israelis sent the message that the group could inflict serious harm on Israel, even if in the end Hezbollah and Lebanon suffered far more. Israel has struggled for years to restore deterrence against Hamas and continues to worry—with good reason—that it is falling short.\nIn addition to punishing airstrikes, the Israeli response may involve significant actions on the ground in Gaza. In the past, Israel has rightly regarded ground operations with caution despite calls by some Israeli leaders to deal with the Hamas problem once and for all. In the past, the more limited nature of the conflict allowed cautious leaders such as Netanyahu to stick to economic pressure and air attacks, minimizing the risk to Israeli soldiers.\nThe scale of Hamas’s latest attack, however, creates enormous pressure for Israel to try to root out the organization from Gaza—an almost impossible task given Hamas’s deep economic, religious, and social base there. At the very least, Israeli leaders will feel pressure to show successes, such as the deaths or arrests of senior Hamas leaders, as well as other visible, and visceral, signs that Israel is striking back. Hamas will be hit hard in the end, and ordinary Gazans will surely pay a heavy price.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 0, "end": 79}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 60, "end": 68}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 243, "end": 277}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 339, "end": 368}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 385, "end": 401}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 385, "end": 401}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 445, "end": 469}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 501, "end": 676}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 679, "end": 839}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 1202, "end": 1386}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 1389, "end": 1481}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1483, "end": 1732}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1947, "end": 1998}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1981, "end": 1998}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 2001, "end": 2123}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2329, "end": 2435}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2461, "end": 2539}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2563, "end": 2617}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2569, "end": 2574}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2620, "end": 3100}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2624, "end": 2635}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 3103, "end": 3153}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 3156, "end": 3185}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3211, "end": 3377}], "article_id": "4279", "lang": "en", "text": "Climate change is being exploited by “mega billionaires” to tyrannize the planet, warns RFK Jr.\n\nIn an interview this week with Kim Iverson, Robert F.

In Iraq and Afghanistan, we fought alongside service members from every race, gender, and political affiliation — and we had each other’s backs. We still do.\nOur armed forces are the standard bearer for American values and principles around the world, and those who serve reflect the nation’s rich diversity of thought, background, and experiences. This diversity makes our military the world’s strongest and most lethal fighting force.\nHowever, some politicians have not only begun to disparage our service members and undermine our top military leaders, but they’ve also set their crosshairs on some of the same service members we fought beside and to whom we all owe a tremendous debt.\nWhen the U.S. Supreme Court issued its ruling last year in Dobbs v. Jackson, overturning Roe v. Wade, thousands of women in service were stripped of access to abortion care. In the year since, 14 states have made abortion illegal, according to the Center for Reproductive rights.\nLet’s talk about how these restrictive laws threaten our national security.\nWhen people decide to serve, they take the same oath we took — the same oath millions of others have taken over our nation’s history. You raise your right hand, go to boot camp, get trained on your job, and go where the nation needs you. You don’t have a choice about where you go to serve — that’s part of the deal.\nMore than 230,000 women and 14,000 LGBTQ+ people serve in our armed forces today, meaning thousands of active duty service members stationed in states with restrictive laws are feeling the brunt of extreme politicians’ efforts to limit their freedoms. The last thing we want to see is accomplished service members separating from service early after being assigned to a duty station where they and their dependents cannot access the healthcare they need.\nIn the aftermath of the Dobbs v. Jackson decision, then-Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Gil Cisneros testified to Congress that, “some servicemembers may choose to leave the military altogether because they may be stationed in states with restrictive reproductive health laws.”\nRetention isn’t the only place our armed forces will suffer because of these extreme laws restricting service members’ freedoms — recruitment will suffer too. Roughly three-quarters of young people believe abortion should be legal. How can we expect recruitment numbers to increase if prospective service members fear being stationed in an area where they’ll be treated like second-class citizens?\nPersonnel is the most important aspect of readiness. As recruitment and retention continue to fall, so does the military’s ability to meet the force requirements necessary to respond to any threat. Service members should be able to focus solely on their mission, not be forced to worry about whether they or their loved ones at home can access the health care they need.\nThankfully, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley, and the Department of Defense acted in the best interest of our national security by protecting access to health care — including reproductive care — for service members and their families, regardless of where they’re stationed. This decision wasn’t driven by politics or the loudest voice but by a conscious and strategic effort to ensure our military maintains its standing as the world’s strongest and most lethal fighting force.\nNow, Sen. Tommy Tuberville has responded by blocking DoD nominations for his own political gain. Not to mention, a small faction in the House of Representatives pushed through a defense authorization bill that would reverse the policy, putting military pay raises on the line and using our service members as pawns to advance their own agenda.\nSo let’s be clear, Sen. Tuberville is actively holding our military hostage and undermining service members who have sacrificed their lives to protect him and his constituents.\nHe must stand down.\nWe learned during our service that our values and national security go hand-in-hand. Our military leaders should always do what’s best for our men and women who serve. We have no doubt that they will continue insulating service members from restrictive state laws just like they do with service members stationed overseas in countries with laws inconsistent with our values.\nSoldiers, airmen, guardians, sailors, and Marines put on the uniform because this country is worth fighting for. Safeguarding our freedoms, keeping our loved ones safe, and providing a future for our children and grandchildren transcends politics and the vitriol that dominates our nation’s discourse.\nThat’s why we chose to serve. That’s why countless women in service chose to serve. We can’t afford to lose them. Our national security depends on it.\nBut more than that, the health, well-being, and freedoms of our service members and their families depend on it."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Slogans", "start": 0, "end": 72}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 75, "end": 110}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 120, "end": 127}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 147, "end": 214}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 214, "end": 286}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 326, "end": 499}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 337, "end": 350}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 724, "end": 892}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 756, "end": 761}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 763, "end": 784}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 907, "end": 931}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 959, "end": 1139}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 1142, "end": 1231}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1931, "end": 1957}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1963, "end": 1968}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 2026, "end": 2227}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 2902, "end": 3162}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3137, "end": 3162}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 3961, "end": 4246}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 4249, "end": 4500}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4684, "end": 4693}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5044, "end": 5050}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5432, "end": 5676}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 5783, "end": 5921}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6950, "end": 6957}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 7172, "end": 7520}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 8462, "end": 8490}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 8509, "end": 8585}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 8756, "end": 9066}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 9069, "end": 9552}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 9416, "end": 9421}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 9555, "end": 9912}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 10715, "end": 10774}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 10933, "end": 11057}], "article_id": "4282", "lang": "en", "text": "TEARS FOR UKRAINE, SANCTIONS FOR RUSSIA, YAWNS FOR YEMEN, ARMS FOR SAUDIS: THE WEST’S GROTESQUE DOUBLE STANDARD\n\n“We’re brutally bombed every day. So why doesn’t the Western world care like it does about Ukraine?!!… Is it because we don’t have blonde hair and blue eyes like Ukrainians?” Ahmed Tamri, a Yemeni father of four, asked with furrowed brows about the outpouring of international support and media coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the lack of such a reaction to the war in Yemen.\nOver the weekend, a member of Tamri’s family was killed and nine relatives injured when their family home was targeted in a Saudi-led Coalition airstrike in the remote al-Saqf area in Hajjah Governorate. Tamri claims that al-Saqf has been subjected to a brutal Saudi bombing campaign for the past seven years – more so, he says, than all of Ukraine has endured since it was invaded by Russia.\nDespite the horrific bombing campaign against Yemeni civilians, Saudi Arabia’s human rights violations and war crimes have garnered nowhere near the level of coverage and sympathy that the mainstream Western media has rightfully given to Ukraine. “They shed tears for the Ukrainians, and ignore our tragedies… What hypocrisy and racism!” Tamri told MintPress News.\n\nYemenis ask the obvious\nAs the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues into the sixth day, an outpouring of support for Ukrainians continues to be seen across the Western world. Severe sanctions against Russia have been imposed by the United States, Europe, Australia, and the West in general, amid a flurry of emergency talks at the UN Security Council. The speed of Western retaliation – which includes banning Russia from the SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) international banking network and calls to treat Russians as international pariahs in sports, culture, and even science – has raised eyebrows among Yemenis who have endured a relentless bombing campaign and deadly air, land, and sea blockade for 2,520 consecutive days.\nSince Thursday, when Russian forces began their wide-ranging assault on Ukraine, the Saudi-led Coalition, supported by the United States, has launched more airstrikes in Yemen than Russia has in Ukraine. In Hajjah, a province surrounded by heavy Saudi artillery, Saudi-led coalition warplanes launched more than 150 airstrikes on the cities of Haradh, Heiraan, Abbs, and Mustab, killing scores of civilians, including a father of six killed over the weekend by a Saudi drone that targeted his car as it traveled between Shafar and the Khamis Al-Wahat market.\nSince Russia’s incursion into Ukraine began, dozens of civilians, including a number of African migrants, have been killed and hundreds wounded by Saudi artillery and airstrikes in Yemen’s heavily populated Saada province, declared a military area by Saudi Arabia at the start of its military campaign in March 2015.\nAs news cameras and solidarity protests gave much-needed sympathy to Ukrainian civilians, in Sana’a, Yemen – which has effectively been turned into a large prison for the city’s more than four million residents and refugees, thanks to a crippling Saudi blockade – warplanes bombed a number of densely populated areas, including the airport. An additional 160 airstrikes were launched on the provinces of Marib, al-Jawf, al-Baydha, Taiz, Najran, and Hodeida, the main entry point for commercial goods and aid into a country facing the worst man-made famine in the 21st century.\nIn fact, it seems as though the Saudi regime is taking advantage of a distracted media in order to escalate attacks on a number of sensitive targets along the Yemen-Saudi border and strengthen its hold over the Al-Mahra Governorate. The UAE, the other major Western-backed oil monarchy occupying Yemen, is likewise making hay, accelerating its project to change the demographics on the prized Socotra Island by displacing locals in favor of settlers more aligned with UAE policies. And while the U.S. readies massive shipments of arms and military aid to Ukrainian “freedom fighters” defending against a Russian invasion, Yemeni “rebels” downed an American-made MQ9-1 drone flown by the UAE in al-Jawf and two American-made Boeing Insitu ScanEagles in Marib and Hajjah.\nAs countries that have spent the past decades building literal and figurative walls to keep out desperate brown and black refugees fleeing violence and foreign invasion in their own lands open their arms, homes, and hearts to fleeing Ukrainian refugees, Saudi Arabia unleashed a force of Yemeni mercenaries upon their homeland with a promise of a Saudi green card and safety for their families if they turn on their fellow countrymen. Ironically named the “Happy Yemen Forces,” the unit was finalized in late 2021, according to leaked military documents, with a mandate to secure Saudi Arabia’s border with Yemen and ensure Saudi security in exchange for a green card and access to the Saudi social services that come with it.\n\nIf we are to compare\nIn terms of the sheer cost of human life, the tragedy in Yemen has been much more deadly than that in Ukraine, where 325 Ukrainians, including 14 children have tragically lost their lives according to Ukrainian officials. Granted the war in Yemen has raged on unabated for more than six years, but comparatively the numbers are astonishing. Since 2015 the death toll has reached an estimated 400,000 people, including 3,900 children.\nThose deaths have included attacks on civilians so egregious that they did garner fleeting media attention but, inevitably, no sanctions, little international condemnation, not even a cessation in the military aid and support to the perpetrators. Bombed-out schools, funerals, wedding halls, refugee camps, even a school bus full of children targeted by the most advanced U.S. weaponry on offer have not been sufficient to elicit the reaction that Ukraine has garnered in less than one week.\nSince 2015, Saudi-led Coalition warplanes have pounded Yemen with over 266,000 airstrikes, according to the Yemeni Army Operations Room, which records airstrikes against civilian and military targets. Seventy percent of those strikes have hit civilian targets. The rising smoke, rubble and flames now seen in Ukraine have been the status quo in Yemen for years, with Western media often deeming the images that appear on local Yemeni television stations, of parents pulling pieces of their children out from the rubble of their homes or schools, too graphic to display.\nThousands of Yemen’s economically vital facilities like factories, food storage facilities, fishing boats, food markets and fuel tankers have been bombed by the Western-backed Saudi Coalition. Critical infrastructure – including airports, seaports, electrical stations, water tanks, roads and bridges and countless more schools, agricultural fields, and places of worship – have been destroyed or damaged. A Saudi blockade and airstrikes on hospitals have crippled Yemen’s health system, leaving it unable to deal with even the most basic public health needs and leaving the 300 facilities that remain in the entire country barely functioning as COVID-19 spreads like wildfire.\nAs the outpourings of condemnation of Russia’s invasion continue, Western governments have sent massive aid packages to Ukraine and social media campaigns fill in the gaps – while in Yemen the United Nations announced that by March it would likely cut aid to 8 million people in a country that it calls home to the worst humanitarian crisis on earth. Household food insecurity in Yemen hovers at over 80%. Almost one-third of the population does not have enough food to satisfy even basic nutritional needs. Underweight and stunted children have become a regular sight and the worst is yet to come, as the Russian invasion has led to increased fuel and food prices and as humanitarian funding dries up, according to the UN World Food Programme.\n\nPicking and choosing which invasion to condemn\nIn March 2015, more than 17 countries led by the oil-rich monarchy of Saudi Arabia launched a military invasion of Yemen, a sovereign state and a member of the United Nations. Ostensibly, the war was launched to restore President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi to power after he was ousted following popular protests amid the Arab Spring.\nBy March 26 of that year, the Saudi-led Coalition, backed militarily and diplomatically by the United States, would begin a bombing campaign that has indiscriminately killed, maimed, and destroyed for seven years. Not only has Saudi Arabia, arguably the most repressive dictatorship on earth, forced Hadi back into power under the guise of protecting democracy, but it has also occupied huge swaths of southern Yemen from al-Mahara to the Bab al-Mandab Strait.\nYemeni journalists, activists and politicians have been left to ponder why Western governments – in particular, the Biden administration – condemn Russia for invading Ukraine under the pretext of national security while defending the Saudi regime’s “legitimate right” to invade Yemen under the very same pretext.\nDespite the horrific human rights violations carried out by Saudi Arabia in Yemen, Western nations, and the United States in particular, have not only provided lethal weapons, training, maintenance, intelligence, and political and diplomatic cover to the monarchy but have imposed media restrictions on coverage of the Saudi regime’s human rights abuses in Yemen, pressuring tech and social media companies to deplatform and outright ban Yemeni activists and media critical of the war.\nAs mainstream Western media gives glowing coverage to Ukrainians resisting their foreign invaders and occupiers – with Western leaders applauding the steadfastness and resistance of Ukrainians and sending aid, weapons and moral support to them – they label Yemenis taking up arms as terrorists and target them with American-made smart bombs and drone attacks. Yemenis who take up arms against invading Saudi and Emirati forces are sanctioned and dismissed as proxies of Iran by liberal media institutions that claim to stand against war.\nOn Monday, the United Nations Security Council extended an arms embargo and travel ban on Yemeni forces. The resolution strongly condemned what it called cross-border attacks by the “Houthis,” a derogatory term used to refer to Ansar Allalh, the single largest force challenging the Saudi invasion and occupation. It went on to condemn “attacks on Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates” referring to Ansar Allah’s missile and drone attacks on Saudi-led Coalition airports and oil storage facilities.\nCommenting on the resolution – which came as the UAE refused to publicly condemn Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, hoping to gain Russian backing for its own invasion of Yemen – Ansar Allah leader Mohammed al-Houthi made one simple request: that Saudi Arabia’s deliberate targeting of civilians in Yemen lead to a Saudi weapons ban. Essentially, al-Houthi asked for a lifting of double standards, apparently an impossible request in today’s political climate."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 0, "end": 81}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 50, "end": 59}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 820, "end": 836}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 872, "end": 883}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 926, "end": 935}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1029, "end": 1168}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1056, "end": 1087}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1107, "end": 1150}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1310, "end": 1407}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1410, "end": 1599}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1435, "end": 1454}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 1644, "end": 1667}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 1922, "end": 1941}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2008, "end": 2080}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2082, "end": 2188}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 2472, "end": 2553}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 3015, "end": 3441}, {"tag": "Red_Herring", "start": 3876, "end": 4011}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3880, "end": 3890}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3895, "end": 3913}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4244, "end": 4287}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 4316, "end": 4479}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 4482, "end": 4836}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 5626, "end": 5997}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 5999, "end": 6130}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 6503, "end": 6657}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 6660, "end": 6780}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 6783, "end": 6844}], "article_id": "4283", "lang": "en", "text": "Logging Off for Life\n\nIn order to fight abortion, pro-lifers must fight the screen.\n\nDespite the great triumph of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization nearly two years ago, the pro-life movement has been losing ground. According to recent data, in states that haven’t banned abortion, the number of abortions has skyrocketed, more than offsetting the reduced number of abortions in states restricting it. While researchers “estimated that around 465,000 abortions occurred during the first six months of 2020, they estimated that about 511,000 occurred during the same period in 2023.” This doesn’t even include mothers who used the abortion pill, which accounts for more than half of all abortions.\nAll this should be a wakeup call for those of us who believed that Dobbs was the culmination of many decades of pro-life activism, a decision that would usher in a pro-life era. The hope was that the movement would be galvanized and a majority of states would follow suit and choose life.\nInstead, the opposite happened. And to make matters worse, militant pro-abortion extremists have been free to deface, vandalize, and occasionally firebomb pregnancy centers. In the courts, the federal government is giving jail time to pro-lifers who dare to exercise their right to speak out at abortion clinics. Doubtless, whatever momentum there was for saving the unborn was quickly smothered by these forces.\nThat said, although this lawless intimidation campaign explains why the pro-life movement has stalled out, it doesn’t explain why more women than before are persuaded to abort their children. It’s not like the arguments have changed. Abortion is still murder. The oft-mentioned but extremely rare exceptions—rape, incest, preserving maternal life—never logically justified all abortions. The stale narratives of female empowerment didn’t somehow become compelling and fresh. And the idea of “bodily autonomy” or “my body, my choice” was officially nullified in the effort to push vaccine mandates.\nSo, if these arguments didn’t change people’s mind on abortion, what did?\nSomething in our culture changed—specifically, people’s perception of killing an innocent child in the womb. At some point in the past few years, many have decided that an unborn child is not a person and an abortion only amounts to cancelling something undesirable. Moreover, the same moral objections that formerly held some back from taking this action register with fewer people today.\nThere’s one major factor that can account for such a change: increased time online. Even if internet use was high in prior years, this became much worse after Covid, as people began to use the internet for everything—work, school, shopping, and basic interactions with family and friends. Ever since the Covid lockdowns, the majority of Americans have become utterly dependent on their screens, and quite predictably, their attitudes about key issues have been affected.\nOverall, the extra time online has made users shallow and desensitized. As Nicholas Carr argued in both his book The Shallows and the classic essay “Is Google Making Us Stupid?” people who use the internet at all hours of the day will find their mind becoming flattened and scattered: “what the Net seems to be doing is chipping away my capacity for concentration and contemplation. My mind now expects to take in information the way the Net distributes it: in a swiftly moving stream of particles.” This means that if an argument takes too long or requires any degree of personal reflection, it will have a harder time resonating with people conditioned to learn about the world through memes and short videos.\nWhen it comes to big issues like abortion, the widespread habit of being always online has made people irrational and callous. Nothing about extinguishing a human life is real to them, and the whole thing seems relative. The grave evils of the abortion regime are as impersonal and unchangeable as the recent earthquake in Morocco or the wildfires in Hawaii. Sure, it might be sad, but it’s a distant issue with little bearing on one’s life—even for those considering aborting their own children. And in the unlikely event that a person has moral qualms, these are easily put to rest with ubiquitous pro-abortion online media content that normalizes all of it.\nAdditionally, the excessive time online has made adults (at least adults of child-bearing age) much less mature, which has direct bearing on their decision to abort. In the past, the usual hypothetical scenario presented by pro-abortion advocates was the bright teenager who made a mistake and now finds her whole future jeopardized by the prospect of early motherhood. Now, a more accurate scenario is a college graduate in her twenties who is nonetheless new at “adulting” and feels generally unprepared to have a child. This feeling can likely be attributed to the fact that she’s spending her days distracting herself on the internet.\nIn light of this, the pro-life movement will need to change course. It’s not so much about changing hearts and minds as it is about changing habits. Massive marches in the cities, picketing at abortion clinics, and sophisticated pro-life arguments simply don’t reach people anymore—most aren’t even there to see or hear any of it. Rather, pro-lifers today must make a case for adults living offline before they can make a case for babies living in the womb. To this end, they should host events and create institutions that encourage people to disconnect from their devices so that they can reconnect with their own humanity and recover the capacity for cherishing life.\nAs philosopher Michael Robillard recently argued in The American Mind, “Only by re-inhabiting traditional self-reliant practices, embodied physical skills, and ways of being in the world, both individually and collectively, can prospective leaders recover a sense of the immediate stakes as well as real-world physical consequences connected to our words and our actions.” In order to recognize the stakes of abortion and other great moral matters, our lives need to be reordered around the physical realm. People aren’t made to spend their waking life staring at flitting shadows in the endless virtual caverns of the internet. Over time, it scrambles their moral compass and erodes their thinking.\nNaturally, religious communities are already outfitted for this project and should take the lead, but that doesn’t prevent other non-religious organizations to unite with them. After all, the same sentiments that inspire people to protect the unborn also move them to support the arts, conserve wildlife, and help the less fortunate. All this and more is possible, and could even trigger another Great Awakening that would revive a civilization in decline. We just need to log off for a while and tell others to do same."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 32, "end": 58}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 65, "end": 222}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 225, "end": 419}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 295, "end": 367}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 508, "end": 743}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 883, "end": 897}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 953, "end": 961}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1018, "end": 1066}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1068, "end": 1220}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 1426, "end": 1471}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1474, "end": 1540}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 1543, "end": 1632}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1904, "end": 1913}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 1987, "end": 2016}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 2019, "end": 2096}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 2099, "end": 2161}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 2182, "end": 2210}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2213, "end": 2306}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2309, "end": 2335}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2434, "end": 2453}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 2552, "end": 2696}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2699, "end": 2866}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 2869, "end": 3084}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 3174, "end": 3197}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 3200, "end": 3249}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 3252, "end": 3388}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 3549, "end": 3786}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3751, "end": 3763}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4081, "end": 4087}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4442, "end": 4558}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 4562, "end": 4704}], "article_id": "4285", "lang": "en", "text": "Understanding Hamas vs. Israel\n\nIsrael is a terrorist state, and the US media — almost entirely controlled by Jewish interests — constantly omit or minimize coverage of the brutal treatment of non-Jews by Jews in the region. Our view of the conflict should mainly be determined by the fact that Israel is the de facto world headquarters of the war against White people and the closely related war against sexual normalcy. And all of us should publicly be asking the question asked by Ricardo Duchesne today: “Why is the Western ruling class in hysterics over tiny Israel without caring one bit for the far worse disaster unfolding for years now — the genetic/cultural destruction of the European race via mass African/Middle Eastern migration?” Nevertheless, it is still important to understand the origins and dynamics of the generations-long Jewish war against Palestinians.\n\nSOME WHITE AMERICANS are getting agitated by the media over alleged Jewish suffering at the hands of Hamas, and the question always arises: Who owns the land that Israel currently occupies?\nI lean more toward the opinion that the Palestinians are in the moral right regarding who really should possess the land that Israel appropriated in 1948. The Jews are forever telling us that the Palestinians did not have a state, since it transitioned rapidly from being a territory of the Ottoman Empire, then a British protectorate, and then. . . Israel. But I don’t see any relevance in that argument. A people need not have organized a state in order to own their land. The reason for organizing a state is to protect your land from being appropriated by force. Unfortunately for them, the Palestinians were never given the time to create guards for their national security. The Jews swooped in too quickly and, with military help from the United States, overwhelmed all Palestinian resistance.\nThe video above details some of the atrocities which the Palestinians have endured for almost 80 years.\nPragmatically, I again favor the Palestinians. Neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians have ever done much for us Americans. But the Palestinians have harmed us less than the Israelis have. The Lavon Affair. The attack on the USS Liberty. The murder of Rachel Corrie. The stealing of US nuclear technology. And many other such things. Israel has been a real pain. And an expensive one.\nIsrael has never been an ally of the United States of America. Not truly. Israel is a parasite. The flow of benefit in the relationship between the two countries has always been one-way only. We give them billions of dollars every year, and we get nothing in return, unless you count the contemptuous attitude that the Jews often show us. Israel has stolen our military secrets and has sold them to Communist countries, and they’ve even attacked our armed forces, and our own government hushes up the thefts. Israel’s partisans in the United States control most of the legacy media, which they used for decades to deceive us about the way power works in the world, to prevent alarm at what they are doing to us from spreading. They control our money, and, to an extent, they still control the flow of information. Israel is not our friend. When our politicians say otherwise, they are lying. They lie because the Jews can tar them with bad publicity and can give their rivals decisive amounts of funding during election campaigns.\nUnderstanding the theft of Palestine from its own people is a little complicated, but the biggest difficulty that most people have is the scale of the theft.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the Rothschilds sent their agent, a Jew named Emmanuel Carasso, to Salonica, in Macedonia, with two purposes: (1) overthrow the Turkish sultan and (2) initiate the extermination of the Armenian people. As the first purpose is the one relevant to this answer, I’ll save discussion on the second purpose for another time.\nCarasso created an organization that was initially called “The Committee for Union and Progress,” but which soon acquired the popular name “The Young Turks.” Through various devious methods, they succeeded in changing the Turkish government of Sultan Abdul Hamid II in July 1908. Ten years and a world war later, the British acquired control of Palestine.\nThe British made two contradictory promises: one to the native Palestinians, and the other to the Jews who were immigrating into Palestine and changing the region’s demographics. Which promise would be kept? In the end, the promise made to the Jews was kept. It was called the Balfour Declaration.\n\nThe Rise of Hamas Was Encouraged by Israel\nHamas was started by Israel as a way to subvert the political influence of Yassir Arafat and the PLO. Israel lost control of Hamas, and the Jews’ meddling in this regard has come back to bite them.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 0, "end": 69}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 250, "end": 427}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 323, "end": 344}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 496, "end": 516}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 931, "end": 1007}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 1010, "end": 1282}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1323, "end": 1334}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1521, "end": 1587}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2074, "end": 2094}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 2097, "end": 2171}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 2402, "end": 2523}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3290, "end": 3310}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 3528, "end": 3666}], "article_id": "4287", "lang": "en", "text": "'What's threatening for Russia is the existence of democratic Ukraine'\n\nEarly on Thursday morning, Russia's president Vladimir Putin ordered a military operation to support the Russia-backed breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, Donetsk and Luhansk.\nPutin said the mission was to \"protect people who have been subjected to bullying and genocide\" and said his objectives were the \"demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine.\"\nUkraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described the action as a \"full-scale invasion\" and appealed for allies to send a message to Moscow through strong action.\nFor the people of Ukraine, the future is uncertain.

He wants to make sure that Kyiv is aligned completely with Russia. He doesn't believe Ukraine deserves to be an independent state, so he will try to take over the capital Kyiv on the attack that he launched in the early days of today. Actually, early hours in that kind of cowardly way while his own citizens were sleeping, especially when we know that a lot of these recordings and his addresses were prerecorded, including the meeting of the National Security Council. So I think he is launching this war in hiding from his own people.\"\n\nWhat is the situation in Ukraine?\n\"Everybody woke up in the new world today, and unfortunately, this world is full of bombs.. What I hear is that this quite big movement of people towards western frontier of Ukraine next to Poland, but also that a lot of people are staying with their families in Kyiv. So far, Russians have been targeting military infrastructure, but they also destroyed several airports in the west of Ukraine. So the whole country is, you know, on one hand in the grip of an aggression. But on the other hand, the Ukrainian armed forces are putting up resistance. It's not 2014. Russia's war came to Ukrainian land in 2014, and I feel sorry that, you know, it has to come again.\"\n\nWhat assistance does Ukraine require from the international community?\n\"It's an aggression or unjustified war. And I see what Ukraine needs is as much support for Ukrainian armed forces to protect the civilians, to protect their land. There has to be assistance in, you know, everything from logistics to medical equipment, evacuation hospitals. Ukraine needs land lease type of economic assistance so that it could purchase necessary things. There has to be a clear message on non-recognition of any illegitimate government that Putin will install and of course, sanctions on Russia. And here, I'll just say one thing: the Russian National Bank holds securities in assets in foreign currency. If Russian central bank is sanctioned, this will cripple the Russian foreign reserves substantially.\"\n\nWhat is the main cause of this crisis in your mind?\n\"This is Russia's own U-turn into more autocratic governance at home, where President Putin is not accountable to anybody and can unilaterally launch a military aggression against the neighbor state. This is at the core of it - NATO is a defensive alliance - was never posing any direct threat to Russian territory, and Ukraine honestly has no perspective of becoming even a NATO member. What was threatening for Russia is the very existence of Ukraine that is governed in a democratic way, not the way Russia is governed today.

The attack – slammed by Moscow as a barbaric terrorist act against Russia's civilian population - left 25 more injured.\n\nWestern leaders have remained tight-lipped on the Kiev regime’s deadly terrorist attack against Donetsk on Sunday, with many mainstream media headlines only mentioning the very fact of the event without singling out who was behind the tragedy.\nOn Sunday, Ukrainian troops shelled Donetsk’s Kirovsky district, a busy area with markets and shops, which are full of people, especially on weekends. It left 27 civilians killed and 25 more injured.\nThe BBC went so far as to cite a “Ukrainian army group operating in the region” as saying that they “did not carry out the attack” – despite the fact that Denis Pushilin, head of the Donetsk People’s Republic, confirmed that Ukrainian troops used 152mm and 155mm artillery systems during the shelling.\nCBS News and Fox News, in turn, preferred not to report on the attack at all.\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was the only official who decisively denounced Ukraine’s shelling attack on Donetsk.\n\"The secretary-general strongly condemns all attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, including today’s shelling of the city of Donetsk, which reportedly killed at least 25 people and injured more than 20 others,\" a spokesperson for the UN chief said on Sunday.\nGuterres stressed that \"Attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international humanitarian law, are unacceptable and must stop immediately.\"\nHe was echoed by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov who told reporters that Russia strongly condemns the attack, and that the special military operation “naturally will continue in order to protect our people from this danger.\" He denounced the shelling as a \"monstrous act of terrorism, as weapons were used indiscriminately.\"\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry, for its part, slammed the attack as \"a barbaric terrorist act against the civilian population of Russia,\" urging international organizations and national governments to condemn the shelling. According to the ministry’s statement, any “silence will mean unspoken approval of the massacre of civilians.”\nThe ministry added that “Kiev's terrorist attacks clearly demonstrate its lack of political will to reach a peace settlement through diplomatic means.”\nHowever, the collective West is no less responsible for this terrorist attack since it has the “desire to inflict a strategic defeat on the Russian Federation using Ukrainian puppets,\" a desire that has pushed Kiev to take even more “reckless steps”, including “terrorist acts, mass violation of international humanitarian law and war crimes,” the statement pointed out.\nThe ministry underscored that the Ukrainian Army used Western weaponry during the shelling, which “once again confirms its [the West’s] direct involvement in the conflict and makes it a partner in the crimes of the Zelensky regime's atrocities.\"\nAccording to the statement, in the light of the Donetsk shelling, the necessity to implement the goals of the special military operation become even more evident since “Ukrainian territory must not be a source of security threats” and a platform for terrorist acts.\nShelling the Donetsk region and targeting civilian areas is not uncommon for the Kiev regime, which has killed at least 9,152 civilians, including 233 children, in the People’s Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk since May 2014, according to the Joint Center for Control and Coordination (JCCC) of issues related to Ukraine's war crimes."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 26, "end": 270}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 47, "end": 57}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 328, "end": 555}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 686, "end": 701}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1119, "end": 1223}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 1226, "end": 1559}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1562, "end": 1747}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1793, "end": 1797}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1821, "end": 1832}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1907, "end": 1929}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 2314, "end": 2337}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2340, "end": 2371}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2374, "end": 2470}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2787, "end": 2859}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3084, "end": 3089}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 3135, "end": 3374}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3188, "end": 3195}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3439, "end": 3556}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3559, "end": 3884}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 3887, "end": 4014}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 4017, "end": 4110}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4113, "end": 4328}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4161, "end": 4206}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4331, "end": 4425}], "article_id": "4292", "lang": "en", "text": "Guilt and the Immigrants\n\nAngela Merkel took a shellacking in German regional elections a week ago, but she’s not about to get tougher on immigration, which is what provoked her bad results. She’s sticking with her open-door policy, even though it isn’t working very well. It is a typical feel-good policy that ignores reality: Merkel, and lots of other German leaders, want to prove that they are fine humanitarians, not the descendants of the Fuhrer. And so they “welcome” hundreds of thousands of refugees and are trying to turn them into good Europeans.\nAlas, most of the refugees—including the many who would really love to assimilate—can’t do that. Not primarily because they are culturally alien, but because they lack the wherewithal to work in modern Germany. They don’t speak or write the language; they don’t have the technical skills, like mathematics, necessary to get a job; and they don’t know how to live in a Western city. So, while the Germans give them apprenticeships to learn work skills, the immigrants drop out to the tune of about fifty percent. The dropouts collect unemployment. Bottom lines: the taxpayers are paying for unqualified refugees, don’t like it, and send that message to the chancellor.\nI’m old enough to remember the Los Angeles riots of 1992, when street gangs destroyed entire neighborhoods downtown. President George H.W. Bush went out to California to get advice from the locals, and one of the hot ideas of the moment was to empower the gangs, let them run businesses, and put their energy to work for the community. It sounded great, but only briefly. If memory serves me right (always a bit chancy), it was Peter Ueberroth who said “they can’t read or write, how in the world can they run a business?” So they went back to fighting, in which the thugs had advanced degrees.\nAssimilation is hard and slow and expensive; you can’t just wave a wand and transform third-world illiterates into productive Western citizens. Maybe in a generation or two it can be accomplished. My grandparents continued to speak Russian and Yiddish, their children mastered English, and some of them even went to college, but it wasn’t until my generation came along, born 40 years after the immigrants cleared Ellis Island, that you had kids who were totally immersed in American culture. And we’re the best at it. Germany’s numbers are off-puting. In about five years, ethnic Germans will constitute less than half the population (lots of Turks).\nMerkel’s policy, then, can be expected to fundamentally transform the makeup of her country, and it goes hand in hand with the original motivation for the creation of the eurozone (and hence the EU itself) in the first place. Helmut Kohl, the architect of the euro, accepted the negative stereotype of his people; he believed that, left to their own devices, the Germans would kill again. His great mission was the elimination of Germany from the map, the dissolution of Germany as an identifiable nation or people. The euro was, so to speak, the acid in which Germany—as symbolized by the deutsche mark—was to vanish, becoming just one piece of the new Europe.\nMerkel shares this vision. She and her followers are tortured by recent German history. They do not want to lead Europe, let alone play a primary role in the Western alliance. She fears her own impulses, and those she ascribes to her people. The immigration policy is a piece of that self-hating vision.\nI think this helps understand why Obama gets along better with Merkel than with most other traditional European allies. They share a very negative view of their national histories, they don’t think their nations are worthy of leading world events, they both have romantic notions about the peoples of failed countries (most certainly including the Middle East), and they prefer to play a secondary role in world affairs (aka “leading from behind).\nThat is why both have adopted immigration policies that may well fundamentally transform their countries in the immediate future. German and American taxpayers don’t like giving money to people who can’t make it on their own. The sympathetic intellectuals brand the critics “racists” or “chauvinists” or even “fascists,” but actually Merkel and Obama are provoking the citizens’ anger, by insisting on policies that fly in the face of reality.\nBoth are likely to provoke national decisions very much at odds with their own confused visions."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Doubt", "start": 0, "end": 20}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 73, "end": 205}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 414, "end": 434}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 438, "end": 451}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 627, "end": 695}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 723, "end": 769}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 1047, "end": 1262}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 1658, "end": 1716}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1940, "end": 1953}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1979, "end": 1986}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2019, "end": 2034}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2117, "end": 2135}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2252, "end": 2268}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2332, "end": 2343}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2488, "end": 2511}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2767, "end": 2831}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3038, "end": 3185}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3242, "end": 3332}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 3675, "end": 3807}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 3819, "end": 3902}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3891, "end": 3902}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 4097, "end": 4175}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4478, "end": 4496}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4518, "end": 4540}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 5029, "end": 5083}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5138, "end": 5151}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5170, "end": 5201}], "article_id": "4293", "lang": "en", "text": "There ‘could be’ deal with Hamas to release Israeli hostages: Netanyahu\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed cautious hope for a deal to secure the release of more hostages held by Hamas.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed cautious hope for a deal to secure the release of more hostages held by the Islamist group Hamas, who have been held for more than a month after the brutal October attack.\n“There could be (an agreement), but I think the less I say about it, the more I increase the chances it materialises,” Mr Netanyahu said in an interview with U.S. broadcaster NBC on Sunday.\nIf a deal is reached, it will only be the result of military pressure, Netanyahu said, adding, “That’s the one thing that might create a deal.”\nMr Netanyahu argued it was also only the Israeli military’s ground offensive in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip that had created any movement in negotiations.\n“If a deal is available, well, we’ll talk about it when it’s there. We’ll announce it if it’s achieved,” he went on.\nNBC and other U.S. media outlets reported, citing government sources, that there were discussions that Hamas could release around 80 women and children in return for Palestinian women and teenagers detained in Israel.\nThere was no official confirmation of this. Netanyahu also did not go into any details of a potential deal.\nU.S. President Joe Biden’s National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, told ABC that negotiations were under way, with Qatar involved and the U.S. government actively engaged.\n“There are efforts to secure a deal that would involve the release of hostages,” Mr Sullivan said, adding that Mr Biden would not rest until such an agreement was reached.\n“I have to be careful about what I say publicly about this because it is of course a delicate and sensitive negotiation,” Mr Sullivan said.\nHamas is still holding 239 hostages, according to Israel.\nThe statements came as heavy fighting continued in Gaza, with violence near the strip’s main hospital escalating fears about the fate of staff and patients as fast-depleting fuel supplies widened the humanitarian crisis among Palestinian civilians.\nThe situation in the al-Ahli hospital, the only hospital in Gaza City still running, “is catastrophic,” said Ghassan Abu Sitta.\nHe said he had performed more than 10 very painful surgical procedures on people without anaesthesia and that blood supplies have also run out.\nGaza’s medical facilities are in increasing focus as the conflict rages on.\nSitta moved there from al-Shifa, the biggest medical complex in the Gaza Strip, now caught up in Israel’s ground offensive.\nThe Israel Defence Forces (IDF) say Hamas has an underground control centre near al-Shifa and is using the hospital as a shield.\nMany fear the building could soon be the target of a major attack.\nSome 10,000 people are still in the hospital, witnesses say, including some too injured to be moved.\nAl-Shifa director Mohammad Abu Salamia said 40 children in critical condition could die at any moment.\nMr Salamia also denied Israeli statements that his hospital rejected fuel supply under pressure from Hamas, calling the claims a “lie and defamation.”\nHis response came after the Israeli foreign ministry reported that Hamas, which rules Gaza, prevented the hospital from using 300 litres of fuel that Israeli soldiers had placed in containers next to the hospital on Saturday evening.\nMr Salamia did not deny the reports about the containers but said the quantity would not be enough to run the hospital generators for “15 minutes.”\nHe said his team was afraid of being shot at if they left the hospital in order to take the containers.\nIf Israel really wanted to supply fuel, it could have sent it in cooperation with the Red Cross or another international organization, he said.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) says conditions in the hospital are catastrophic, with care barely possible due to the nearby fighting and lack of fuel.\nEarlier, the WHO lost contact with staff at al-Shifa. In the last two days the hospital in Gaza City had reportedly been “attacked multiple times, leaving several people dead and many others injured,” the organisation said.\nWitnesses saw tanks surrounding the hospital, the WHO said.\nAll of Gaza’s hospitals are struggling, and videos and photos shared online show dozens of injured men, women and children lying on the floor of crowded corridors, waiting for treatment.\nGaza as a whole has been under intense bombardment by Israel since the Hamas terrorist attacks on October 7, which left about 1,200 people in Israel dead. Israeli ground forces have now penetrated deep into Gaza.\nThe Israeli attacks since October 7 have killed over 11,000 people according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza.\nIsrael’s army says it is not deliberately targeting the health facility, but going after militants.\nThere were also further clashes on the Israeli-Lebanese border. There have been exchanges of fire on the border almost every day since the war began, leading to fears the war could spread to further fronts.\n“An IDF fighter jet and aircraft struck a number of terror targets belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organization, including a military compound containing a weapons storage facility and military infrastructure,” the Israeli military said in the evening.\nThat came after Lebanese state news agency NNA reported that Israeli warplanes and drones had been flying over the border area and attacking targets since the morning."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 0, "end": 59}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 100, "end": 226}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 259, "end": 298}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 302, "end": 484}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 533, "end": 575}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 534, "end": 573}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 623, "end": 638}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 689, "end": 736}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 852, "end": 1037}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 945, "end": 989}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1091, "end": 1133}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 1235, "end": 1264}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1267, "end": 1390}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2028, "end": 2174}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 2177, "end": 2217}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2318, "end": 2463}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2733, "end": 2848}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2967, "end": 3019}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3103, "end": 3355}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3358, "end": 3648}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3684, "end": 3753}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3916, "end": 3944}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4238, "end": 4310}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4412, "end": 4529}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4571, "end": 4860}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5075, "end": 5095}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5097, "end": 5114}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5117, "end": 5562}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 5565, "end": 5796}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 5799, "end": 5805}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 5892, "end": 5898}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 5983, "end": 5989}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 6070, "end": 6144}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6218, "end": 6229}], "article_id": "4294", "lang": "en", "text": "Capitalism Is Curing COVID-19, Government Is Making It Worse\n\nIt seems wherever you go on the left, you can find a hot take about how free market capitalism is endangering the world at a time when we need unprecedented wartime-like planning and coordination.\nNew York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio argued, “This is a case for a nationalization, literally a nationalization, of crucial factories and industries that could produce the medical supplies to prepare this country for what we need.”\nThe Atlantic published a think piece arguing “There Are No Libertarians In An Epidemic.” Mic.com joined in with a similar message, and the further-left Jacobin Magazine and The Nation both argued that now more than ever we need to socialize medicine. And of course such takes abound in exponential amounts on social media.\nThis is hardly just an American problem. The South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong newspaper that has been regularly accused of being a mouthpiece for the Communist Party of China—since its purchase by Alibaba Group and Jack Ma, a member of the party—published a letter attacking “the laissez-faire approach to the economy” for supply shortages along with a whole host of social ills and asking the government to “step in.”\nThe truth is just the opposite. In China, America, and nations around the globe, catastrophic government failures have allowed this virus to become a crisis, and it’s businesses that are successfully stepping up to save lives.\nPresident Trump brought attention to many such cases in a news conference.\nHoneywell is opening two new manufacturing facilities to produce N95 masks, eventually leading to five times their current production. Jockey International is stepping up production of medical gowns and donated 10,000 scrubs to frontline medical workers in New York.\nUnited Technologies donated 90,000 pieces of personal protective equipment to FEMA. MyPillow is converting its call centers to help with the pandemic and is converting 75 percent of its manufacturing to producing facemasks.\nMuch of the left—rather than appreciating this—has instead expressed concern about the company’s CEO discussing his religious beliefs at the podium. Right or wrong, that’s not the story here.\nAdditionally, Facebook is donating 720,000 N95 masks, Goldman Sachs 600,000 and Apple 10 million. Meanwhile, the federal government had 1.5 million of them sitting in a warehouse, incapable of figuring out how to release them in a timely manner.\nSimilar stories are occurring around the world. In the United Kingdom, vacuum tycoon James Dyson designed an entirely new ventilator and is manufacturing 15,000 of them. In Japan, Sharp has converted TV factories to produce surgical masks. Foxconn the same in China.\nWhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was producing defective test kits (and in insufficient numbers), private companies like LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics stepped up to develop and rush to market functional test kits. That’s according to reporting from The New York Times.\nIt was also The New York Times that broke the appalling story of how early on in the international spread of coronavirus, the government prevented doctors in Washington state, funded by the private Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, from testing samples from people suffering flu symptoms to determine if they were positive for COVID-19.\nBoth the state and federal governments refused to provide approval for weeks; when out of ethics concerns the doctors began testing the samples illegally, they discovered a case in a local teenager, but by then he’d already had far too much time unquarantined and was likely infecting others.\nThe teenager’s school shut down, but even then the state government told the doctors to “stop testing.” They went to the FDA to get their test approved, but the FDA told them approval wasn’t possible because the lab wasn’t certified under CMS regulations.\nAfter an “extraordinary and rare” plea was made to the FDA commissioner, he responded that they must still submit the tests for emergency authorization. But even the emergency process takes far too long, with one doctor complaining “this virus is faster than the FDA” as he was asked to mail documents to the FDA instead of email.\nIf the government had acted differently, many lives might have been saved. That was true in China too, where a doctor noticed early cases of COVID-19 and feared an epidemic. He tried to get the word out, but the police accused him of “making false comments” and disturbing the “social order.” That doctor has since died of COVID-19.\nWhere our government has stepped in to take positive action, they’ve often failed miserably. The federal coronavirus bill provided $25 million to keep the Kennedy Center operational, yet even with that massive amount they’ve laid off staff, leading lawmakers to try to claw back the subsidy.\nIn New York, the state government is experimenting with exactly what DeBlasio wanted: nationalizing the production of hand sanitizer. Gov. Andrew Cuomo claims they can produce it cheaper than private enterprise. How is that possible? Modern slave labor. They’re paying prisoners 16 cents an hour to produce the product.\nThe most successful government interventions to help in this crisis seem to have been getting out of the way.\nAmericans for Tax Reform has logged more than 250 regulations that have been waived to help with the crisis, many of which it’s baffling why they ever existed. That includes waiving regulations that prevented the development of telemedicine, now more necessary than ever.\nThis freeing of enterprise to fight in this crisis is a clear story of the success of capitalism. And none of the above even mentioned the everyday examples we take for granted of how capitalism has made living in this time possible.\nWe have Amazon, Postmates, and more making it possible to survive without needing to go out. We have the internet and phones allowing us to stay connected with our friends and family. We have computer technologies allowing many of us to continue our employment remotely.

For instance, back in 2017, they’d shared the phrase “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” — which implies replacing Israel with a Palestinian state.\nAt Monday’s city council meeting, Marcano and Coombs confirmed these suspicions. When Councilwoman Francoise Bergan proposed a resolution heartily backing Israel and unequivocally condemning Hamas and anti-Semitism, Marcano and Coombs offered amendments to fundamentally change its intent — by trying to equate Israel with Hamas.\nEarlier that day, Coombs touted the Working Families Party, a radical alternative to DSA that tends to endorse identical candidates. “I stand with WFP in their push to save the lives of Palestinians in the face of Israeli war crimes and apartheid,” she tweeted.\nLet’s be real: Neither Marcano nor Coombs were being genuine — and they were clearly playing politics when they canceled their DSA memberships. Now, their politics have begun alienating loyal Democrats.\nLittleton Democrat Jane Ringer is a retired accountant who, until recently, served as the Arapahoe Democratic Party’s volunteer treasurer. A donor to candidates across the county, she’d originally assumed her views would largely align with both Marcano and Coombs and donated a total of $125 between the two.\nThis week, Ringer asked both Marcano and Coombs to send her money back. “As a Jew whose father fought in World War II, I find their positions to be appalling. I thought we already fought this battle, you know?” she told me. “I have zero tolerance for the obliteration of Israel. So, I’m voting with my wallet by asking for my money back.”\n“I am now in alignment with my values, and I feel much better having spoken up,” Ringer added. “This just cuts way too deep for me.”\nWhen a candidate you support abandons your core values, you can always “claw back” any donations. If enough join in, it could deplete campaign war chests.\n“There’s still three weeks left until election day, and people should know they can vote not just with their ballot but with their money,” Ringer said. “If you have already donated, and you’ve suddenly discovered that a candidate is way out of alignment with your values, you can request a refund of your donation and explain to them why you’re doing it.”\nA growing number of wealthy donors are similarly voting with their wallets at a much larger scale — objecting to the shocking failures of Ivy League universities to decisively condemn anti-Semitism and show support for Israel in its battle against Hamas.\nThe Huntsman Foundation, which has contributed tens of millions of dollars to the University of Pennsylvania, decided to “close its checkbook on all future giving” due to the university’s “silence in the face of reprehensible and historic Hamas evil against the people of Israel (when the only response should be outright condemnation).”\nOther notable billionaire donors like Ronald Lauder, Marc Rowan and David Magerman likewise threatened to cut their contributions to Penn.\nHarvard University also faces staggering donor dissatisfaction. Former Limited Brands CEO Les Wexner’s Wexner Foundation cut off funding after three decades over “the dismal failure of Harvard’s leadership to take a clear and unequivocal stand” against Hamas. Other wealthy donors and alumni publicly blasted Harvard’s shocking tolerance of anti-Semitism.\nThe presidents of both Harvard and Penn finally issued strongly-worded statements condemning Hamas and rejecting anti-Semitism — but it’s likely too little, too late.\nFor different reasons, as Newsweek reported Wednesday, at least 10 former donors to embattled Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert — who collectively contributed nearly $13,000 to her 2020 campaign — have instead donated $17,800 total to her opponent in the Republican primary, lawyer Jeff Hurd.\nHurd announced his campaign this August but already reportedly raised nearly half of Boebert’s $854,000 in the bank — which is itself only a third of the whopping $3 million that her Democratic challenger, Adam Frisch, raised from July to September.\nIf Boebert wins her primary, as remains likely, can she raise enough to compete with Frisch? When I was in Mesa County last weekend, Boebert supporters expressed concern that her numerous rhetorical excesses and personal faults might doom her campaign in what should be a breeze reelection for a Republican.\nReality is starting to intervene in our heated sociopolitical climate. People are finally reaching their limits — drawing lines and making their voices heard through their wallets.\nThe actions of our leaders and institutions have consequences."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 0, "end": 13}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 498, "end": 518}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 530, "end": 579}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 639, "end": 659}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 860, "end": 1019}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 888, "end": 895}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 900, "end": 915}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1234, "end": 1387}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1617, "end": 1627}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1632, "end": 1646}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2028, "end": 2165}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2168, "end": 2227}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2358, "end": 2366}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2528, "end": 2701}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2758, "end": 2936}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3485, "end": 3650}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3653, "end": 3829}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3833, "end": 4032}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4035, "end": 4172}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4235, "end": 4248}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4318, "end": 4386}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4318, "end": 4332}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4619, "end": 4785}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 4871, "end": 4914}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5029, "end": 5077}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5080, "end": 5255}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5258, "end": 5415}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5496, "end": 5576}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 5689, "end": 5718}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5966, "end": 6045}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6180, "end": 6277}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6268, "end": 6277}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6662, "end": 6768}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6895, "end": 7084}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 7291, "end": 7368}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 7464, "end": 7657}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 7923, "end": 8025}], "article_id": "441", "lang": "sl", "text": "Floskulizacija prehranske politike\n\nPrejšnji teden se je konstituiral strateški svet za prehrano, ki je bil sicer uradno ustanovljen že konec lanskega leta. Ob ustanovitvi so na vladni spletni strani oznanili, da bo delo sveta usmerjeno k pripravi predlogov in ukrepov za boljšo oskrbo državljank in državljanov s cenovno dostopno, kakovostno in varno hrano, ki ima hkrati tudi najmanjši možni negativni vpliv na zdravje ljudi, okolje in podnebje. Ustanovitev je dvignila precej prahu. Od tega, da gre za zaroto veganov, do tega, da bo Golob prepovedal zrezke in zapovedal korenje. A že po ustanovni seji je bilo jasno, da so bile bojazni zagrizenih mesojedcev preveč optimistične. Po seji je predsednik vlade Robert Golob povedal, da ne bo šlo za nikakršno prisilo k zmanjšanju količine zaužitega mesa, temveč izključno za ozaveščanje za lažjo osebno izbiro. Drugače povedano, šlo bo za floskule in ideološke parole, ne pa za dejanske politike, ki bi kakorkoli pripomogle k zmanjšanju porabe in predvsem produkcije mesa. \n\nProblematiko prekomernega uživanja mesa je takrat še ne premier Robert Golob izpostavil že na predvolilnih soočenjih, ko se je zavzel za zmanjšanje porabe mesa in njegovo nadomestitev z ustrezno ponudbo hrane. Pri tem ga ni podprl nihče od preostalih predsednikov in predsednic strank, ki so očitno ocenili, da gre za nepriljubljeno temo in se ji je bolje izogniti. Golob je tudi zaradi izjemno močne javnomnenjske in medijske podpore imel priložnost to temo izpostaviti kot eno od prioritet in pomembnih političnih vprašanj. Pred njegovim vstopom v politiko je bila ta tema pri nas popolnoma zanemarjena in marginalizirana. Golob je tako v reševanje podnebnih sprememb uspešno lansiral tudi vprašanje prehrane.\n\nPodnebne spremembe so bile v nacionalni politiki pred tem zreducirane pretežno na vprašanje pridobivanja električne energije. Bitka se je bíla na fronti solarizacije in drugih alternativnih virov energije – ali nas bodo uspešno razogljičili ali bomo za to potrebovalni drugi blok nuklearke. Vsi so pozabili, da približno tretjinski delež k ogljičnemu odtisu doprinese prehrana, pri kateri bistveno izstopa hrana živalskega izvora. Nekateri si uteho sicer iščejo v izgovorih o lokalnem izvoru, a dejstvo je, da transport mesa v tem smislu prispeva zanemarljiv delež v primerjavi z živinorejo samo. Meso kot vir kalorij je nevzdržno ne samo z vidika izpustov toplogrednih plinov, temveč je za njegovo proizvodnjo potrebnih tudi bistveno več obdelovalnih površin kot pri rastlinski prehrani. \n\nČe se premier zaveda problema konzumacije mesa, resnosti podnebnih sprememb in nujnosti ukrepanja, ne bi smelo biti razloga, da se osveščanje ne spremeni v konkretno politiko. Trenutno nismo niti na točki nič, smo nekje v minusu. Država financira zelene prehode, trajnostni razvoj in kar je še teh lepih besed, hkrati pa ogromno denarja namenja promociji mesa in mlečnih izdelkov ter subvencijam za živinorejo. V novem finančnem obdobju subvencioniranja kmetijstva v okviru skupne evropske kmetijske politike, ki se je začelo z začetkom tega leta in se končuje z letom 2027, bo za neposredna izplačila kmetom namenjenih več kot 650 milijonov evrov. Od tega velika večina za osnovne splošne subvencije, pri katerih je delež živinoreje že v osnovi največji med vsemi kmetijskimi panogami. Dodatno bo država 13 odstotkov tega denarja namenila tako imenovanim panogam v težavah, med katere pa so uvrstili izključno rejo različnih živali, vključno z govedorejo. Popolnoma kontraproduktivno je osveščati ljudi o pretirani porabi mesa in hkrati denar porabljati za oglaševanje prav teh izdelkov in financiranje njihove proizvodnje. V predvolilni kampanji je danes koalicijska stranka Levica sicer podprla postopno ukinitev subvencij za živinorejo, a tudi ta obljuba je bila dana bolj potiho, kasneje pa zamrla.\n\nTežko si je predstavljati, da bi strateški svet za prehrano ali slovenska politika v kratkem prišla na točko nič, na kateri se proračunska sredstva ne bi porabljala za okoljsko sporne kmetijske prakse. Še težje pa si je predstavljati, da bi šli še korak dlje in živinorejo namesto spodbujanja poskusili dejansko omejiti ter preiti na ukrepe, ki so precej bolj priljubljeni, ko je treba v imenu zdravja stigmatizirati kadilce, ki s svojimi življenjskimi navadami škodijo predvsem sebi. Mesojeda večina se že ob omembi zelenjave zdrzne in glasno protestira, čeprav njihove prehranske navade okolju škodijo precej bolj. Na zdravstveni vidik pretiranega uživanja mesa sicer opozarja tudi Nacionalni inštitut za javno zdravje, ki trenutno povprečje ocenjuje kot resno tveganje za zdravje, a zdi se, da tudi to v resnici nikogar ne zanima niti toliko, da bi prepovedali prodajo mesa po deveti uri, kar naj bi bil učinkovit ukrep pri zmanjšanju porabe alkohola. V zrak bo tako sproščenega še mnogo metana, preden bomo na mesnih izdelkih gledali grde fotografije posledic podnebnih sprememb, preden bo oglaševanje mesa prepovedano in preden bo živinorejska industrija plačevala davek na ogljični odtis.\n\nSlovenska politika je v veliki meri performativna. Prvi politik države na veliko govori o pomenu zmanjšanja mesa, hkrati pa za ministrico v svoji vladi izbere Ireno Šinko, ki v medijih nastopa kot izpostava živinorejcev v vladi. Tudi pri izbiri osnovnih izdelkov, katerih cene redno spremljajo, je ministrstvo za kmetijstvo pod njenim vodstvom pokazalo, kaj razumejo kot osnovno prehrano. V osnovni izbor so tako vključili tri vrste mesa in niti ene vrste zelenjave. Ministrica za razliko od premierja težave ne identificira niti na retorični ravni. Na vprašanje v intervjuju za Mladino, ali se strinja s tem, da moramo jesti manj mesa, enostavno odgovori, da ona je, kar ji najbolj ustreza. Ne pozabi pa omeniti, da bi nekaj finančne spodbude potrebovala prašičereja, in opravičevati oglaševanja mesa z lokalno proizvodnjo, ki zmanjšuje ogljični odtis. Doda, da je oglaševanje usmerjeno le na tiste, ki meso tako ali tako že uživajo. \n\nPodobno resna je v svojih namerah tudi prva političarka države Nataša Pirc Musar. Tudi ona je v svojih predvolilnih nastopih redno poudarjala, da bo v svoj kabinet uvedla funkcijo svetovalca za podnebne spremembe. Njena funkcija je že v osnovi zelo performativne narave, zato bi bil očitek v tej smeri deplasiran. Težava je, da je predsednica svojo politiko za zmanjšanje porabe mesa pripravljena pripeljati točno do točke, na kateri v kabinet pripelje svojo svetovalko za podnebne politike. Že v predvolilni kampanji se kot ena redkih med predsedniškimi kandidati in kandidatkami ni zavezala k prevladujoče brezmesni prehrani na protokolarnih pogostitvah z namenom zniževanja ogljičnega odtisa. Kasneje je v intervjuju za Radio Študent pojasnila, da je tradicija tu pač pomembnejša od okoljskih vplivov. Je pa še kasneje sprejela nekakšno novoletno zaobljubo in dejala, da se javno zavezuje, da en dan v tednu ne bo jedla mesa. Zaveza sama po sebi je manj problematična kot dejstvo, da predsednica države misli, da je to kakršnekoli omembe vreden podvig, ki bi ga morala s ciljem postavljanja zgleda deliti z javnostjo.\n\nVsaj zaenkrat se zdi, da bo meso ostalo najbistvenejši del prehrane Slovencev. Golob je sicer javno povedal, da je cesar gol in da sta proizvodnja mesa ter neposredno povezana konzumacija problematični, a zdi se, da nikomur zares ni v interesu storiti koraka v smeri reševanja tega. Osredotočenost na posameznika in reševanje težav s slabimi zgledi ne bosta prinesla rešitev. Vlada, ki ni prišla dlje od uvedbe redne brezmesne opcije v vladni menzi, bi se morala osredotočiti na spremembo proizvodnje na brezmesne in s tem podnebno sprejemljivejše prehranske alternative. Ključni mehanizem v njihovih rokah so subvencije, ki so esencialen del obstoja trenutnega kmetijstva, zato lahko na ta način vsaj postopno začnejo njegovo prestukturiranje. Premier je sicer povedal, da je prehrana ena izmed treh prioritet vlade v letošnjem letu, a politiki in političarke so besedo snedli skoraj tolikokrat kot goveji stejk na protokolarnih večerjah.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 0, "end": 36}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 165, "end": 210}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 165, "end": 183}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 285, "end": 367}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 415, "end": 675}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 561, "end": 675}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 722, "end": 751}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 885, "end": 930}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 914, "end": 919}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 933, "end": 1001}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 933, "end": 941}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 986, "end": 1224}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1135, "end": 1189}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1144, "end": 1154}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1192, "end": 1224}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 1227, "end": 1394}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 1227, "end": 1332}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 1227, "end": 1297}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1335, "end": 1394}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1436, "end": 1496}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 1499, "end": 1537}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1539, "end": 1572}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1575, "end": 1697}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1724, "end": 1812}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1802, "end": 1881}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 1886, "end": 1925}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1940, "end": 2007}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1954, "end": 2007}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 2198, "end": 2293}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 2303, "end": 2372}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2341, "end": 2372}], "article_id": "4410", "lang": "sl", "text": "Dve epidemiji – COVID-19 in sovraštva\n\nV Sloveniji imamo še zmeraj epidemijo oziroma – kar dve.

Epidemija COVID-19 je res težka preizkušnja, iz katere pa bomo, kar zadeva gospodarstvo, po zaslugi sedanje vlade izšli močnejši – z možnostmi za dobro gospodarsko okrevanje. Slovenija se v času epidemije ni zadolžila nič bolj kot druge evropske države.

Na mizi je tako tudi zakon o dolgotrajni oskrbi, ki se v minulih letih nikakor ni premaknil z mesta. Vlada dela dobro, in to kljub opoziciji, ki jo ovira in ji nagaja že ves čas.

Treba je vedeti, da sta nenehno ponavljanje laži, absurdov in nesmislov, ki jih trosita opozicija in  protestniki − ti imajo raje kot slovenske zastave države, ki je že 30 let ni več −, pregon, ki ima cilj osamitev in upehanje, nedopustna, zato je treba pokazati podporo razumu in ponavljati resnična dejstva: da vlada dela dobro, hitro in učinkovito – z eno besedo odlično. Prav v zadnjem tednu se je začelo govoriti o shodu podpornikov vlade, ki naj bi bil načrtovan v juniju. To je pozitivno, a bo nasprotna stran spet vpila, da vlada izziva nemire, čeprav v resnici to počne to samopozicija. \n\nZato je treba najti še več drugih načinov, da bo resnica našla pot do ljudi. \n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 9, "end": 21}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 87, "end": 109}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 130, "end": 139}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 224, "end": 231}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 303, "end": 309}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 434, "end": 450}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 453, "end": 509}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 659, "end": 686}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 797, "end": 810}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 831, "end": 844}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 943, "end": 958}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1176, "end": 1184}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1233, "end": 1248}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1250, "end": 1272}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1772, "end": 1808}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1811, "end": 1834}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2040, "end": 2090}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2183, "end": 2354}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2222, "end": 2232}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2259, "end": 2281}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2491, "end": 2522}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2543, "end": 2694}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2594, "end": 2635}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2921, "end": 2930}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3068, "end": 3112}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3291, "end": 3334}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 3548, "end": 3664}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3600, "end": 3613}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3667, "end": 3723}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3762, "end": 3776}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3846, "end": 3872}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4116, "end": 4134}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4152, "end": 4220}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4172, "end": 4197}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4364, "end": 4386}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 4486, "end": 4493}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4540, "end": 4547}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4634, "end": 4644}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4680, "end": 4808}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4735, "end": 4750}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4762, "end": 4778}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4811, "end": 4886}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4922, "end": 5017}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4946, "end": 4958}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5245, "end": 5274}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 5354, "end": 5375}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5378, "end": 5504}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5447, "end": 5488}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5641, "end": 5749}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5848, "end": 5899}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5858, "end": 5866}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5927, "end": 5959}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5973, "end": 6007}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6026, "end": 6046}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 6177, "end": 6263}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6245, "end": 6263}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6334, "end": 6349}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6355, "end": 6441}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6417, "end": 6438}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6617, "end": 6641}], "article_id": "44100", "lang": "sl", "text": "Gaza čez evropska usta\n\nMedtem ko ameriški državni sekretar v zadnjih tednih praktično živi na Bližnjem vzhodu, kjer se sestaja s šefi držav, je po mesecu dni domet evropskih voditeljev dogovor o humanitarni pomoči za Gazo. To je to. To je v tem trenutku EU.\n\n\"Koga moram poklicati, če želim govoriti z Evropo?\" (Henry Kissinger, nekdanji ameriški zunanji minister)\n\nBilo je maja letos, a se zdi kot leta nazaj. \"EU se je spremenila. Poti nazaj ni več. Ugasnili smo luči za sabo, pred nami je le ena pot naprej,\" je bila navdušena podpredsednica Evropske komisije Margrethe Vestager, sicer tista komisarka, ki je v zadnjih desetih letih preiskovala in tožila ameriške tehnološke velikane, Siemens, Alstom in Gazprom.\n\nKo je govorila o EU kot \"geopolitični sili\", je imela v mislih njen odgovor na rusko agresijo na Ukrajino. Ko so Putinovi tanki februarja 2022 šli nad Kijev, se je nekaj časa res zdelo, da je Unija v zunanjepolitičnem smislu vstala od mrtvih.\n\nPrvič v svoji zgodovini je EU uvedla 10 krogov sankcij proti agresorski državi (Rusiji) in zagotovila neposredno vojaško pomoč napadeni državi (Ukrajini). Le eno, sicer toplo zimo je potrebovala, da je za polovico oklestila uvoz ruskega plina. Resda pozno, a vendarle je stopila na prste energetskim špekulantom, ki so s tankerji pred evropskimi obalami čakali na dvig cene plina. Z \"bailouti\" energetskih podjetij pa je preprečila scenarij iz Velike Britanije, kjer gospodinjstva niso zmogla več plačevati računov za elektriko. Po desetletju so se znova odprle celo razprave o širitvi EU.\n\nIn nato se je zgodila Gaza.\n\nNajprej zaustavili, nato potrojili humanitarno pomoč\n\n7. oktober, dan Hamasovega pokola 1.500 ljudi v kibucih okrog Gaze, ni bil 11. september le za Izrael, ampak tudi za EU – v smislu, da je \"dan pozneje\" spet ni videti nikjer. Odziv Evrope je kaotičen od prvega dne, ko je evropski komisar za širitev Oliver Varhelyi takoj napovedal zaustavitev humanitarne pomoči za Palestince, a ga je visoki predstavnik za zunanje zadeve Josep Borrell takoj \"popravil\", da bi \"kaznovanje Palestincev škodilo interesom EU\".\n\nKmalu zatem je EU potrojila pomoč, a je v mesecu dni ostalo bolj ali manj zgolj pri tem. Sprijaznila se je z neambiciozno vlogo humanitarke, ki v Jeruzalemu treplja vedno bolj izgubljenega Benjamina Netanjahuja, palestinskim civilistom v Gazi pa daje drobtinice, medtem ko se arabske države bolj ali manj glasno sprašujejo, kaj je sploh njen cilj.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen je v Jeruzalemu govorila o izraelski pravici do samoobrambe. Toda od tu naprej nikoli ni jasno dala vedeti, ali to vključuje tudi kolektivno kaznovanje dveh milijonov ljudi na območju Gaze ali celo njihovo trajno preselitev v Egipt, o kateri so nekateri v Jeruzalemu na glas razmišljali. Emmanuel Macron, šef edine evropske države, ki ima jedrske bombe, je Netanjahuju predlagal, da bi šla nad Hamas mednarodna koalicija, ki se v Siriji in Iraku bori proti teroristom Islamske države. To je storil prav v času, ko so ZDA delale vse, da se konflikt iz Gaze ne razširi na jug Libanona.\n\nMedtem je Nemčija, obremenjena z zgodovinsko krivdo za holokavst, na lastni \"liniji\". Olaf Scholz je Izraelu pet dni po Hamasovem napadu ponudil vojaško pomoč zaradi \"zgodovinske odgovornosti za izraelsko varnost\", šef nemških zračnih sil pa se je v Izraelu udeležil krvodajalske akcije.\n\nKaj sploh hoče EU?\n\nPo mesecu dni je linija ZDA jasna: s pomočjo tihe diplomacije, kjer ključni igralec postaja Katar, zagotoviti, da se vojna ne razširi na Zahodni breg in jug Libanona. V Washingtonu vedo, da to ne bo mogoče, ne da se izraelsko časovno okno z \"bianco menico\" za maščevanje po skoraj 10.000 mrtvih v Gazi zapre. Pri EU še vedno ne vemo, kje smo in kakšen je sploh načrt.\n\nJe to nadaljevanje vojne, ki terja strahovit davek med civilnim prebivalstvom, ali prekinitev ognja? In potem? Podpora maščevanju za množični umor z vojnimi zločini? Smo v Evropi za vrnitev Gaze pod palestinsko samoupravo in \"status quo\" na Zahodnem bregu? Je v načrtu razmišljanje o časovnici za priznanje Palestine, torej \"rešitvi dveh držav\", o kateri zdaj govori Borrell? Ali pa zgolj neskončno objemanje z Netanjahujem, ki ga celo nekateri donedavni domači zavezniki že pozivajo k odstopu?\n\nŠele v teh dneh je Macron pozival Izrael k zaščiti civilistov. Medtem ko ameriški državni sekretar Antony Blinken v zadnjih tednih praktično živi na Bližnjem vzhodu, se voditelji EU se pogovarjajo o morskem koridorju, po katerem bi pomoč do Gaze prišla s Cipra.\n\nTo je to. To je v tem trenutku EU. V krizi, ki lahko \"raznese\" regijo na njenem spodnjem robu, je Unija s pol milijarde prebivalcev zreducirana na \"rdeči križ\". In ponujanje slamic Netanjahuju, ki ve, da premirje ob njegovi nesporni odgovornosti za varnostni fiasko ob pohodu Hamasovih klavcev pomeni njegov politični konec. Zato skuša vojno zavleči čimdlje v kampanjo za ameriške predsedniške volitve.\n\nVeliki konflikti gredo mimo EU\n\nV zadnjih mesecih se je brezzobost EU pokazala še v dveh zgodbah v njeni neposredni soseščini EU. Konec oktobra so se po dolgih mesecih brez uspeha prekinili pogovori o ureditvi odnosov na relaciji Srbija-Kosovo. Pri tem so edini, ki so Aleksandra Vučića uspeli stisniti v kot, spet Američani, ki so očitno izsilili odstop proruskega notranjega ministra Aleksandra Vulina.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen je v Jeruzalemu govorila o izraelski pravici do samoobrambe. Toda od tu naprej nikoli ni jasno dala vedeti, ali to vključuje tudi kolektivno kaznovanje dveh milijonov ljudi na območju Gaze ali celo njihovo trajno preselitev v Egipt, o kateri so nekateri v Jeruzalemu na glas razmišljali.\n\nŠe pred tem je režim v Azerbajžanu izpeljal \"končno rešitev\" vprašanja enklave Gorski Karabah, ki je pomenila izgon 120.000 tamkajšnjih Armencev. Če odštejemo Macrona, ki ga k temu zavezujejo zgodovinske vezi med Francijo in Armenijo, Evrope tudi pred eksodusom na tem območju praktično ni bilo.\n\nČe k temu prištejemo še \"upravljanje\" migrantskih \"tokov\" in dejstvo, da je EU pozabila na severno Afriko, je slika jasna. Enotno pokritje hrbta Ukrajini je bilo prej enkratni dogodek kot začetek preobrazbe EU v geopolitično silo, o kateri je govorila Vestager.\n\nZa nameček se ji utegneta hitro ukrepanje in pomoč Ukrajini na Bližnjem vzhodu vrniti kot bumerang. Arabski voditelji bodo lahko EU očitali dvojna merila, pri čemer je žalostna resnica, da se je Unija 30 let, tam nekje od Osla naprej, pretvarjala, da palestinskega problema ni. Nekatere članice so priznale Palestino, druge razmišljale o selitvi ambasad v Jeruzalem, tretje, med katerimi so tudi najmočnejše, pa dale prosto pot dogodkom na \"terenu\".\n\nMar res ne zmore(mo) več?\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Doubt", "start": 0, "end": 90}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 282, "end": 343}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 346, "end": 430}, {"tag":

tistimi iz Sirije in Afganistana\n\nOb ruskem napadu na Ukrajino so v slovenski vladi izrazili pripravljenost sprejeti begunce iz te države, kar na videz predstavlja preobrat njene protibegunske politike. A odločitev ne razkriva toliko humanitarnosti kolikor rasistično mišljenje vladajočih.\n\nGlede na razširjeno potrebo po izkrivljanju stališč in intelektualne nepoštenosti, ki preveva tako slovensko politiko kot njene podpornike v javnosti, je smiselno kljub odvečnosti takoj poudariti, da si begunci iz Ukrajine zaslužijo vso solidarnost in pomoč v praksi. Slovenija je tem ljudem dolžna zagotoviti zatočišče in jim pomagati na vse načine, ki bi lahko olajšali njihov položaj. K temu nas ne zavezujejo samo mednarodne konvencije, ampak predvsem naša človečnost. Prav zaradi nje pa se ne pustimo preslepiti selektivnim gestam humanitarnosti, ki se v teh dneh širijo iz ust predstavnikov vlade in njihovih podpornikov.\n\nMinistri kar tekmujejo med seboj, kdo bo bolj empatično izrazil solidarnost z žrtvami vojne v Ukrajini. Slovenija bo poskrbela za begunce, pravijo, govori se o dodelitvi enakih pravic, kot jih imajo začasni prebivalci Slovenije, vlada že vzpostavlja centre za begunce. Minister za notranje zadeve Aleš Hojs je dejal, da sicer ne ve, kakšno bo končno število ljudi, ki bi jih Slovenija lahko sprejela, a da se bo sam zavzel za \"veliko številko\", če bo to potrebno.\n\nKje v teh izlivih skrbi za sočloveka se torej skriva rasizem? Poglejmo izjavo ministra za obrambo Mateja Tonina, ki jo je na dan začetka napadov podal na Televiziji Slovenija. \"Glede na vse slike, ki se trenutno pojavljajo, je jasno, da se bo pomemben del ukrajinskega prebivalstva tudi umikal v sosednje države. Tukaj bo šlo za prave begunce. Sosednje države so že napovedale, da jih bodo sprejele, in če bo neki delež teh beguncev morala prevzeti tudi Slovenija, bo zagotovo nosila pomemben, fer delež v tej zgodbi. Zdi se mi pomembno, da jim v teh kritičnih trenutkih tudi pomagamo.\"\n\nKar minister Tonin sporoča, pa tega ne upa povedati v celoti, je, da so nekateri begunci \"pravi\", drugi pa \"lažni\". \"Pravi\" so, kot kaže, belci, kristjani iz Ukrajine, medtem ko so nebeli pretežno muslimani iz Sirije, Iraka in Afganistana ali Afričani zgolj \"ilegalni migranti\". Ta dehumanizirajoč izraz v vladi redno uporabljajo za označevanje ljudi, ki skušajo priti v EU iz v vojnah razdejanih držav Bližnjega vzhoda ali Afganistana in Afrike. Ne pozabimo, nacisti so begunce (še posebej Jude), ki so v 30. letih prejšnjega stoletja bežali iz takratne Nemčije, označevali za Wirtschaftsemigranten oziroma ekonomske migrante, ljudi, ki iščejo zgolj korist. Gre za poskus diskreditacije in delegitimizacije teh ljudi kot \"pravih\" beguncev, prakso prejšnjega in, kot vidimo, zdajšnjega stoletja.\n\nKo gre za belce, v vladajoči stranki opuščajo protipravna stališča\n\nVsi \"argumenti\" zoper begunce, ki jih je trenutno vladajoča opcija ponavljala z namenom upravičevanja svoje ksenofobne, rasistične politike, so zdaj, ko gre za evropske belce, obrnjeni na glavo. Bežanje pred vojno je postalo upravičeno, vlada ne straši s 44 milijoni Ukrajincev, ki bi želeli priti v EU zaradi socialnih pomoči, kot to počne s stotinami milijonov Afričanov ali Arabcev, ni več pomislekov, da si Slovenija sprejema beguncev preprosto ne more privoščiti, ni plakatov z lažmi, koliko denarja dajemo \"migrantom\", ne poslušamo o tem, da je treba tem ljudem pomagati \"blizu izvorni državi\", ni izmišljotin, da lahko begunec za zaščito zaprosi le \"v prvi varni državi\", kot smo neštetokrat slišali od predstavnikov trenutno vladajoče stranke in njenih podpornikov. Te radikalne in protipravne neusmiljenosti so tako deležni le temnopolti in muslimani, ki naj zaradi, kot lahko razumemo, svoje koristoljubnosti, ne glede na spol ali starost, zmrznejo v gozdovih ob meji ali utonejo v reki.\n\nSlovenska vlada v trenutni sestavi predstavlja čisto, nefiltrirano obliko institucionaliziranega rasizma. Na družbenem omrežju Twitter je Urad vlade za komuniciranje (Ukom) pod vodstvom Uroša Urbanije v petek (na 30. obletnico izbrisa od vseh dni) sporočil: \"Ukrajinski begunci prihajajo iz okolja, ki je v kulturnem, verskem in zgodovinskem smislu nekaj povsem drugega kot okolje, iz katerega prihajajo begunci iz Afganistana.\" Gre za priznanje, da vlada dodeljevanje mednarodne zaščite pogojuje s \"pravo\" vero in kulturo prosilca, gre naravnost za hierarhizacijo skupnosti ljudi. Že vsaj od 80. let 20. stoletja teoretiki rasizma opozarjajo na \"kulturalizacijo rasizma\". T. i. novi rasizem tako ne temelji več zgolj na rasni kategorizaciji, ampak izključuje tudi na podlagi pripisanih kulture, vrednot, morale. Ta \"diferencialistični rasizem\" je manj očiten, saj na prvi pogled ne poudarja večvrednosti določenih skupin ljudi, ampak zgolj domnevno nekompatibilnost življenjskih stilov in kultur, kot je v izdaji Časopisa za kritiko znanosti iz leta 2015, posvečeni vprašanju rasizma, pojasnila Mojca Pajnik. Ukom je tvit naknadno sicer izbrisal, a njegova vsebina za vlado ni problematična. Enako misel je namreč ponovil minister Hojs.\n\nRasizem vlade, njenih ministrov in glavnega PR-ovca torej leži v diferenciaciji ljudi na osnovi njihove vere ali kulture, kar je evfemizem za etnično pripadnost ali barvo kože. Takšno razlikovanje ljudi predstavnikov vlade pa ni novost. Spomnimo se izjave premierja Janeza Janše, ki je ob 30. obletnici plebiscita dejal, da je \"prav vsak, ki je s svinčnikom obkrožil za samostojno Slovenijo, ne glede na svoj izvor po krvi postal del slovenskega občestva, del naroda v modernem smislu\". Katera ideologija še deli ljudi glede na \"izvor po krvi\", o kakšnem \"modernem smislu\" govori Janša?\n\nProzoren preobrat Slovenije, Poljske, Madžarske\n\nA vlada ni edina, ki se je nehote (spet) razkrila kot rasistična, identičen odnos imata namreč tudi ultrakonservativni vladi na Poljskem in Madžarskem, znani po ostrih protipriseljenskih politikah in militarizaciji humanitarnih vprašanj. Medtem ko je Poljska lani na mejo z Belorusijo poslala vojsko in postavila ograje in bodeče žice z namenom zaustavljanja ljudi iz bližnjevzhodnih držav ter jih v nasprotju s svojimi mednarodnopravnimi obveznostmi vračala v Belorusijo, pri čemer jih je v gozdovih več umrlo – premier Morawiecki je govoril o \"zlu, ki ogroža Evropo\" –, ukrajinske begunce sprejema z odprtimi rokami, vsaj za zdaj. Enak pristop ima tudi madžarski premier Viktor Orban, ki zdaj izraža pripravljenost za sprejem beguncev iz Ukrajine, medtem ko je ob prihodu beguncev z Bližnjega vzhoda kričal o ogroženosti države in zahodne civilizacije ter načrtni \"islamizaciji\" Evrope.\n\nPolitika do beguncev, odvisna od njihove vere in barve kože, pa ni edino merilo za prepoznavo rasizma trenutno vladajočih. Nekaj se da izluščiti tudi iz njihovih gest, kot je izobešanje zastav drugih držav na poslopju vlade. Radi imajo plapolanje zastav, nekaj močnega in ganljivega vidijo v tem. Janša je dal tokrat izobesiti zastave Ukrajine v znak solidarnosti z žrtvijo obstreljevanj in vojaške zasedbe. Maja lani je dal izobesiti zastave Izraela, v znak solidarnosti z državo, ki je obstreljevanje in vojaško zasedbo izvajala (in to počne še naprej), ter v posmeh pretežno muslimanskim žrtvam teh dejanj. Janša in celotna vlada pod njegovim vodstvom jasno sporočata, da je to, kdo si zasluži zaščito, pomoč in razumevanje, odvisno tudi, ali predvsem, od njihove vere, barve kože in ideološke sorodnosti. Slovenska družba ne sme privoliti v takšno instrumentalizirano in razvrednoteno humanitarnost, ampak mora vztrajati pri stališču, da si našo pomoč zasluži vsakdo, ki jo potrebuje, od Kijeva do Gaze, Kabula in Lagosa. To pa bo terjalo trajno družbeno marginalizacijo rasistov med nami.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 0, "end": 35}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 54, "end": 97}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 119, "end": 204}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2386, "end": 2473}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 2744, "end": 2893}], "article_id": "4412", "lang": "sl", "text": "Covid-19 bo čez nekaj let le prehlad, a še nismo tam\n\nCovid-19 bo v roku nekaj let navaden prehlad. Toda nismo še tam. Še vedno gre za bolezen, ki vsak dan pošilja ljudi v intenzivno nego in v prerani grob.\n\nMeseca maja leta 1889 je v Buhari, tedaj Ruskemu imperiju, zdaj Turkmenistanu, izbruhnila nenavadna bolezen, ki je spominjala na gripo. Bolezen se je pokazala kot vročica, kašljanje, kihanje, večina ljudi je odnesla brez posledic, toda približno štiri odstotke obolelih je umrlo. Konec 19. stoletja to ni bilo nič nenavadnega, toda bolezen je prek razvejanega železniškega omrežja potovala v svet. Avgusta je bila v Samarkandu, starodavnem trgovskem središču v današnjem Uzbekistanu, oktrobra v Tomsku, globoko v Sibiriji.\n\nJeseni je prišla v prestolnico Rusije, izbruh v Sankt Petersburgu je okužil petino prebivalstva, pojavila se je tudi v Kijevu. Novembra je nova bolezen že bila v Stockholmu in v Durbanu, v Južni Afriki. Posen, Berlin, Grenoble, Tulon, Glasgow, Chicago, pred pomladjo 1890 je bolezen že obkrožila svet, postala prva pandemija v zgodovini in dobila ime: ruska gripa.\n\nPomlad 1890 je prinesla olajšanje, toda že jeseni se je ruska gripa ponovno vrnila. Niti leto 1891 niti 1892 nista bili povsem mirni, saj so se po vsem svetu odvijali posamični periodični izbruhi in smrti, ki so jih včasih obvladovali bolje, včasih slabše. Zadnji izbruh je bil zabeležen šele leta 1895, nakar je ruska gripa nenadoma potihnila in izginila. Po vsem svetu je zaradi nje umrlo milijon ljudi, preračunano na prebivalstvo tistega časa je to kar primerljivo s covid-19.\n\nBolezni se je reklo ruska gripa, toda obstaja kar nekaj indicev, da so bolezen napačno prepoznali. Klinično je bolezen močno spominjala na covid-19, tako po znakih bolezni, kot po smrtnosti, vzorcu smrtnosti in tudi hitrosti, s katero je mutirala. Virusi gripe mutirajo izredno hitro, zato epidemije gripe praviloma trajajo samo eno sezono, ruska \"gripa\" je trajala pet let.\n\nPreprečili smo hujše rezultate\n\nPrehlad ni ena bolezen, temveč družina virusnih obolenj, ki jih povzročajo različni virusi, a se kažejo podobno – izcedek iz nosu, boleče grlo, prehodna vročina. Eden od virusov, ki povzroča prehlad, je sev z imenom OC34, ki se je po genetskih analizah ločil od kravjega koronavirusa in dobil zmožnost okužiti človeka pred približno 130 leti – ravno ob izbruhu ruske gripe.\n\nKonsenza tu ni, vendar nekateri znanstveniki menijo, da ruska gripa ni bila gripa, temveč koronavirusna bolezen. Tej bolezni bi danes rekli covid-89, če uporabimo konvencijo, ki smo jo uporabili za covid-19. Potek je bil podoben, znaki so bili podobni, objela je ves svet in po nekaj letih poniknila v ozadje bolezni, ki so sicer neprijetne, a jim ne posvečamo posebne pozornosti. Glede na trenuten razvoj pandemije covid-19 in smer evolucije virusa verjetno podobna usoda čaka tudi covid-19, v roku nekaj let bo to navaden prehlad.\n\nToda pomembno je vedeti, da covid-19 trenutno še ni prehlad. Še vedno gre za bolezen, ki vsak dan pošilja ljudi v intenzivno nego in v prerani grob. Covid-19 je neprimerno bolj nalezljiv od povprečnega prehlada in povzroča bistveno resnejša obolenja. S cepivi, prekuževanjem in skrbjo zase in za druge smo v veliki meri preprečili hujše rezultate, toda zavedati se moramo, da pandemije še ni konec in je po vsej verjetnosti ne bo konec pred poletjem 2025. Do takrat moramo računati na občasno nošenje mask, zaščitno vedenje in testiranje, tudi kakšna injekcija bo morda še potrebna. V šahu je najtežje zmagati dobljeno partijo, enako je tudi pri bodočem prehladu: zmagali bomo, samo odnehati ne smemo.\n\nToda smo že na polovici in druga polovica bo bistveno lažja od prve.\n"},

se jim udinja\n\nMoški, ženska. Ženska, moški. Dva spola. Stvar se zdi dovolj preprosta. Nobenih komplikacij. Če se je mati narava kdaj poigrala, je nastal še nenavadni križanec, ki je bil hkrati oboje in nobeno. Že stari Grki so tej neznatni skupini rekli hermafroditi. Zakaj neznatni? Zato, ker ni bila nekaj običajnega. Bila je nekaj neznatnega. Navadno take stvari sploh ne bi bilo treba dodatno pojasnjevati, a kaj moremo? Dobrodošli v krasni nori svet.\n \nČe so bile še do nedavnega za “spremembo spola” potrebne operacije, pa je po najnovejši modi za to dovolj že sama odločitev, da se počutite kot moški ali ženska. Danes ste moški, jutri ste lahko ženska. Temu novemu pojavu “raznolikosti, ki bogati”, naj bi rekli transspolnost. Če ste danes ženska, ste lahko že jutri moški. Sama funkcionalnost od Boga danega orodja že dolgo ne igra nobene vloge.\n\nToleranca se je sprevrgla v udinjanje norosti. Diskriminacija, ali po domače razločevanje, pa je postala umazana beseda. Reči, da je moški nor zato, ker trdi, da je ženska, te dni pomeni napad na “ranljivo skupino”. Nekako za ranljivo skupino nimajo drugih žensk, ki jih ta posameznik masakrira v ringu. V svetu, ki to dopušča, lahko z gotovostjo trdimo, da ni nor transspolnik, nor je svet.\n\nNekdo, ki si domišlja, da je kralj, je navaden blaznež in norec\n\nPoskus Michela Foucaulta, da bi dosegel humano ravnanje z duševnimi bolniki, se je sprevrgel v občo norost sveta. Če so v preteklosti norce zapirali v norišnice, da bi si lahko domišljali, kako marginalizirani elementi družbe ne obstajajo, je danes družba privzela norost norcev, zato da bi se slednji počutili normalne. Iz ene skrajnosti smo zašli v še hujšo. Foucault se je v svojih delih rad skliceval na srednji vek, ko so norcem rekli norci in jih pustili, da blodijo po svetu. Dokler niso nikomur škodovali, so bili lokalna posebnost, ki so si jo ljudje, ki so imeli preveč prostega časa, z veseljem ogledali, se čudili, se ji mogoče nasmejali ali pa samo zmajevali z glavo.\n\nŠe Descartes v svojih Meditacijah mimogrede navrže, da je nekdo, ki si domišlja, da je kralj, navaden blaznež in norec, kot nekaj, kar naj bi bilo vsem jasno. A danes več ni tako. Če so nekoč posameznika, ki je zatrjeval, da je Napoleon in zahteval od drugih, da mu izkazujejo primerno spoštovanje, zaprli v norišnico, danes nekoga, ki je moški, a se počuti kot ženska, družba začne klicati z njej_mu ljubimi zaimki. Te nežne rožice so lahko ob najmanjši ignoranci za njihove zaimke nepopravljivo zaznamovane. Prav zares, znašli smo se v krasnem norem svetu, kjer se družba prilagaja blodnjam izbrane manjšine, vse v imenu sočutja in strpnosti.\n\nTransspolniki na lepotnih tekmovanjih in celo v športih\n\nNajnovejši prikaz te norosti v družbi prihaja iz Španije. Najlepša ženska v državi je v resnici moški. Na tekmovanju za Miss Universe Španije je tako zmagal transspolnik po imenu Angela Ponce. Ponce nastopa tudi na modnih revijah. Za moj okus abotno, a če ga želijo – za zdaj je še vedno prosti trg – tako modna industrija kot kupci, lahko počne, kar hoče. Vseeno se zdi absurdno, da je izbranec na tekmovanju, namenjenemu ženskam, moški, ki se počuti kot ženska. A kaj hočemo, tako je. Tako smo sami dovolili, da postane.\n\nBolj zaskrbljivi od lepotnih tekmovanj so športi in borilne veščine. To, da neka sprevržena komisija zaradi lastne ideološke agende razglasi moškega za najlepšo žensko, je eno, drugo, veliko hujše pa je, ko olimpijski komite dovoli tekmovati moškim v ženskih disciplinah. Biologija je namreč jasna, zaradi tega sploh obstoj moških in ženskih disciplin. Še hujše je, ko borka mešanih borilnih veščin v oktagonu naleti na transspolnika, kakršen je Fallon Fox, ter izgubi v manj kot minuti. Kar naj bi bil pošten boj med enakovrednima tekmicama, se hitro spremeni v mesarsko klanje. Fox proti drugim moškim borcem v njegovi težnostni kategoriji ne bi imel možnosti. Ženske tekmovalke lahko nadvlada in se izživlja nad njimi brez najmanjšega problema.\n\nNa žalost se ne bo končalo tukaj. Na žalost bodo v teh krvavih športih potrebne žrtve, preden bodo zavarovali tekmovalke pred nepravičnimi okoliščinami, v katere so pahnjene zato, da bi ugodili norostim manjšine.

Resni, odgovorni in fini ljudje namreč niso zgolj navadni občani kot cenjeno bralstvo teh vrstic ali (bog ne daj) njihov avtor. Resnim, odgovornim in finim ljudem (s kratico ROFL) so stvari jasne.\n\nGre za kaliber ljudi, ki vam zna povedati, zakaj ideje o zelenem prehodu niso vredne recikliranega papirja, na katerem so napisane. Zakaj je stanovanjska problematika nekaj, kar je najbolje prepustiti trgu. Pa tudi, zakaj gre svet k vragu zaradi feminizma in razvajene mladine, ki ima polno rit vsega, ne razume, kaj je dobro zanjo, in ne ve, kje ji je mesto.\n\nPlečečnikov stadion\n\nKo so mladi na ljubljanski iteraciji podnebnega štrajka zavili tudi na Plečnik-Pečečnikov (Plečečnikov) stadion in tam posadili nekaj dreves, se je po njih usulo, kot da so cesarici posekali lipo. Dobro, vandalizma in motenja posesti res ne kaže podpirati, prav tako pa ni treba zganjati moralne panike. Nikomur se ni zgodilo nič, škoda ni velika in tudi policija se ni odzvala čezmerno.\n\nŠe največji misterij pri vsem skupaj je, zakaj je mularija drevesa sadila na terenu, kjer še trava stežka raste. Res je, mesta potrebujejo čim več zelenih površin, ki so dostopne splošni javnosti. Prav tako potrebujemo drevesa, ki hladijo urbana naselja. A bežigrajski stadion, trinajsto prase športne politike in odnosa do kulturne dediščine, ni najbolj očiten medij za takšno sporočilo.\n\nČeprav je bil komunikacijski pristop nenavaden, sporočilo ni bilo nič manj jasno. Zato posmeh, zaničevanje in celo bes, ki so ga bili mladi protestniki deležni od resnih, odgovornih in finih ljudi, povedo več o teh kot o udeležencih protesta.\n\nJoca Pečečnika gre v njegovem srdu še nekako razumeti. Leta 2009 je napovedal, da bodo prvo tekmo odigrali leta 2013. Leta 2023 se projekt še vedno ni premaknil in prav v preteklih dneh je sodišče odločilo, da so vrtički ob stadionu del zemljišča bližnjih Fondovih blokov in sploh ne morejo biti del projekta.\n\nLastnik stadiona je upravičeno slabe volje. A z ovadbami proti mladim ne bo veliko dosegel. V zapor zaradi sajenja dreves ne bo šel nihče, morebitno dosojeno odškodnino pa bi podjetnik le stežka izterjal, saj mladi resnega premoženja nimajo. Naj jim za kazen zarubijo telefone?\n\nProblem seveda ni v tem, da so mladi posadili tistih nekaj dreves sredi nogometne zelenice.\n\nMularija z mnenjem\n\nProblem, kot ga vidijo resni, odgovorni in fini ljudje, je v tem, da mladi s prihodnostjo, kot so jim jo zastavili isti resni, odgovorni in fini ljudje, nočejo imeti opravka.\n\nŠe večji problem je, da so si mladi drznili povedati, kaj si mislijo o prihodnosti, ne da bi pri tem dvignili roko in prosili za dovoljenje.\n\nMularija z mnenjem? Kaj hujšega! Kam pa pridemo, če bo zdaj že vsak najstnik gobcal v kamero o tem, da hoče boljšo prihodnost. Ali vsaj prihodnost, v kateri naš planet ne postane goreča krogla, ki jo občasno hladijo poplave in skok v morje pri Postojni. Petnajstletniki – tako pravijo resni, odgovorni in fini ljudje – nimajo kaj izražati mnenj, saj so za to še premladi in v nasprotju z ROFL-ovci še ne vedo dovolj.\n\nRes je, stvari pogosto niso tako preproste, kot se lahko zdijo povprečnemu petnajstletniku. Ali povprečni trinajstletnici, če smo že pri tem. A kako, lepo vas prosim, naj se mularija nauči nians razmišljanja, ne da bi, torej, razmišljala?\n\nIn točno v tem je keč, kot se reče.\n\nMladina – ki v resnici niti ni več tako mlada – s protesti daje jasno vedeti, da si želi bolj pravične, vzdržne in solidarne prihodnosti, ker so sicer planetu šteti dnevi. A hkrati s tem sporoča, da so dnevi šteti generaciji, ki danes v rokah drži platno in škarje. Da se njen čas nezadržno izteka. In to je tisto, kar najbolj plaši resne, odgovorne in fine ljudi.\n\n\"Smo se za to borili?\"\n\nKajti tudi oni so bili pred tridesetimi in več leti mladi. Tudi oni so takrat zase zahtevali boljšo, svetlejšo in pravičnejšo prihodnost. In se pri tem požvižgali na to, kaj si o njih mislijo starejši občani. Ti so vili roke ter hlastali za zrakom ob nespoštovanju in vandalizmu mladih, ki naj ne bi razumeli, kako svet deluje in kaj je dobro zanje.\n\nZato je neznansko smešno opazovati blatnodolske resne, odgovorne in fine ljudi, večinoma pripadnike generacije X, ki se do milenijcev in generacije Z obnašajo natanko tako, kot so se do njih obnašali babyboomerji in stari partizani. Vse, kar manjka, je kakšen bivši hipi, ki bi zavzdihnil: \"Ali smo se za to borili?\"\n\nPovedano drugače, podnebni štrajk mladih je sprožil ihtavo cepetanje ljudi, ki uživajo sadove svoje slavne revolucije. Tem ljudem niti na misel ne pride, da bi zdaj popuščali nekim smrkavcem, ki hočejo – pomislite! – spremembe.\n\nNe samo, da revolucija žre lastne otroke, občasno ima tudi smisel za humor.\n\nPo drugi strani pa je vse skupaj precej tragično. Ti liki imajo v svojih rokah skoncentrirano praktično vso politično, gospodarsko in akademsko moč, a se vedno znova obnašajo kot nemočne žrtve nekakšnega imaginarnega družbenega nasilja. Mladi jim hočejo vzeti avte, migranti jim hočejo vzeti službe, LGBT-osebe jim hočejo vzeti otroke, komunisti jim hočejo vzeti muzej in ženske jim hočejo vzeti, no, jajca.\n\nBrum, brum\n\nTako smo, na primer, ob nedavnem 8. marcu izvedeli, da danes nimamo več pravega feminizma, saj so bile edine prave feministke njihove feministke. Kajti njihove feministke so se borile za enakopravnost, ne pa za enakost, kot to počno te razvajene sodobne feministične frajle. Ženske imajo lahko enake pravice, pravijo resni, odgovorni in fini ljudje, ne morejo pa biti enake moškim.\n\nIn ko zunanja ministrica napove feministično zunanjo politiko, gredo tem likom lasje (kolikor jih še imajo) pokonci od groze, ko ugotovijo, da bi se ženske zdaj mešale v vse. Od zakulisne diplomacije do mirovnih pogajanj. Namesto da bi ostale vsaj v bližini kuhinje in porodnišnice, če jih že vanju ne morejo več zapreti.\n\nIn ta vzorec se ponavlja od skupine do skupine, od téme do téme. Kajti resnih, odgovornih in finih ljudi v resnici ne skrbi kakovost mladinskega premisleka, prav tako ne razlika med enakopravnostjo ter enakostjo žensk in moških. V resnici jih ne skrbi niti muzej ali posvojitev otrok v mavrične družine.\n\nResne, odgovorne in fine ljudi skrbi, da bodo izgubili tisti presežek družbene moči, s katerim kolikor toliko uspešno branijo status quo. Skrbi jih torej, da ne bodo mogli več določati pravil igre.\n\nIn čeprav se morda zdi drugače, ta strah ni omejen na zgolj eno politično opcijo ali eno stran političnega spektra. Tudi med samooklicanimi levičarji boste našli cel kup tistih, ki menijo, da mavrične družine niso družine, ki ženske na visokih položajih še vedno razumejo kot okras in marketinško potezo ter prepoved prodaje novih vozil na fosilna goriva kot napad na njihovo moškost. Kako naj bo moški moški, če ne more za volanom delati \"brum, brum\"?\n\nPravi moški\n\nDejstva seveda govorijo ravno nasprotno. Samopodoba, učni in siceršnji uspeh ter zadovoljstvo otrok niso pogojeni s spolno strukturo družine, pač pa s celim kupom drugih dejavnikov. Avtomobili na fosilna goriva bodo tako ali tako izumrli, kot so izumrli dinozavri, ki so nam ta fosilna goriva dali. Ženske na najodgovornejših mestih v politiki, gospodarstvu, znanosti in drugod pa predstavljajo predvsem svežo zalogo znanja, izkušenj in vpogledov in ne zgolj poenostavljene logike tipa \"ženske so z Venere, moški pa z Marsa\".\n\nIn ko smo že pri tem, vsak pravi moški zna vihteti kuhalnico in valjar.\n\nMoški. Boomer. Starejši moški. | Foto: Shutterstock Foto: Shutterstock V odsotnosti dejstev v prid neubranljivega statusa quo poskušajo resni, odgovorni in fini ljudje pri soljudeh vzbuditi čustva. Predvsem jezo, strah in občutek ogroženosti. Čustva torej, ki prevevajo predvsem njih same.\n\nIn tako pridemo do zanimivega paradoksa, ko se samooklicani pravoverni levičarji znajdejo na istem bregu kot besni desničarji, ki se prehranjujejo s teorijami zarote. Pri čemer ne eni ne drugi ne pomislijo, da je družba, v kateri so se znašli, najboljši pokazatelj tega, da se motijo.\n\nKdo ve, morda pa bo res konec sveta.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 102, "end": 426}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1341, "end": 1411}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 1341, "end": 1540}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 1640, "end": 1752}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1828, "end": 1916}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 1857, "end": 1916}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1857, "end": 1869}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1929, "end": 2126}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1959, "end": 2126}], "article_id": "4415", "lang": "sl", "text": "Leto 2023 je bilo najtoplejše v zgodovini meritev.

Kot ključni ukrep je poudaril opustitev fosilnih goriv, poroča francoska tiskovna agencija AFP.\n\nNujnost opustitve fosilnih goriv je v odzivu na poročilo izpostavil tudi generalni sekretar ZN-a Antonio Guterres. Kot je sporočil njegov tiskovni predstavnik Stephane Dujarric, je namreč lansko leto zgolj predogled \"katastrofalne prihodnosti, ki nas čaka, če ne ukrepamo zdaj\".\n\nGuterres zato verjame, da se voditelji morajo zavezati resnim novim podnebnim načrtom, hitro in pošteno končati dobo fosilnih goriv in vlagati ter pomagati ranljivim državam pri spopadanju s podnebnim kaosom, je še dodal Dujarric.\n\nTemperaturne rekorde so lani izmerili na vseh celinah. Vendar pa je bilo v Evropi to drugo najtoplejše v zgodovini, saj je bilo za 0,17 stopinje Celzija hladnejše od rekordnega leta 2020.\n\nLani so strokovnjaki izmerili tudi nenavadno visoke temperature oceanov.

Vse to vpliva na šolski sistem, ki se spreminja in se še bo nekaj časa prav zaradi te krize. Ta ukrep pa ni ostal brez kritik – namreč, MS mediji promovirajo domnevno izjemno nezadovoljne učence in zelo nevarno agendo uporništva, saj jim ta vlada seveda ni po godu. Ob vsem tem se poraja vprašanje, Kako zadovoljni so res učenci? Bilo bi pa zanimivo vedeti, če bi mediji in voditelji današnje opozicije namerno širili napačne informacije, ko bi bila na oblasti (njihova) leva opcija?\n\nPrvič po osamosvojitvi smo lani trinajstega marca zaprli šole, zaradi nevarnega eksponentno naraščajočega števila okužb s Covid-19. Popolnoma enako so ravnale države po svetu, ki so s tem hotele zajeziti hitro širjenje nevarnega virusa. Šole so večinoma ostale zaprte do konca šolskega leta, razen za maturante in nekatere osnovnošolce, ki so se predčasno vrnili v šole. Za ostale je pa bilo smiselno, da ostanejo doma, saj je bil konec šolskega leta za vogalom po koncu epidemije.\n\nNaslednje šolsko leto smo po slabih dveh mesecih spet pristali za računalniki, potem ko je število okužb naraščalo, kar so nekatere opozicijske stranke izkoriščale prihajajočo se krizo za zbiranje političnih točk. Spomnimo, stranka SD je pozivala vlado in stroko celo k odpravi ukrepa nošenja mask v višjih osnovnošolskih razredih in srednji šoli. Sledili so štirje meseci učenja na daljavo, za katere lahko osebno rečem, da so minil s svetlobno hitrostjo. Trenutno še vedno poteka učenje po modelu C, po katerem velja, da se razred en teden uči v šoli, drugi pa na daljavo. Ker sem dijak 4. letnika, sem iz tega izključen.\n\nV februarju so nekateri srednješolci protestirali proti učenju na daljavo, s tem da se niso udeležili videokonferenc ali pa so celo protestirali v živo. Veliko pozornosti je dobil protest v Mariboru, kjer smo lahko videli transparente in slogane stranke SD, eno od teh je: »DovolJJ nam je!«. Ob tem se vsak razumni človek vpraša, če so bili ti »spontani protesti« politično motivirani, saj je predstavnik protestov bil Lars Podkrajšek, dijak ki se je aktivno udeleževal petkovih »kolesarjenj« okoli slovenskega parlamenta. Je tudi viden član Mladinske aktivistične organizacije, s kratico MAO, ki zelo spominja na kitajskega komunističnega diktatorja Maa (Mao) Cetunga. Ta je bil med državljansko vojno in po njej odgovoren za 77 milijonov smrtnih žrtev.\n\nNajvečji argument protestnikov je bil nezadovoljstvo nad učenjem na daljavo. Sami so opevali, citat: »Komaj čakamo, da se vrnemo v šolo!«, kar zelo težko verjamem, saj se moja brata, sorodniki, prijatelji ter tudi jaz osebno nikoli nismo in ne bomo neizmerno veselili obiskovati šole, vsaj večina. Da, pogrešal sem sošolce in tudi učitelje, vendar si nikoli nisem izredno želel nazaj zaradi pouka. Tak problem bi postal realen, če bi ostali doma še prihodnja številna leta. Tudi izobrazba je do neke mere stagnirala, vendar je potrebno pretehtati človeška življenja in nekaj mesecev šole na daljavo.\n\nŠe bolj ironično je, da so tisti, ki so pozivali k odprtju šol, danes največji kritiki ukrepov, ki sploh dopuščajo odprtje le-teh. Ko so stroka in Minister za zdravje, Janez Poklukar predlagali samotestiranje učencev, tako kot po večini evropskih držav ter se je dokazala kot odlična preventiva, vsul plaz kritik na trenutno vlado z mediji na čelu. Pri tem naši sosedi, Avstrijci nimajo nobenih težav pri izvijanju samotestiranja za novi korona virus, saj tamkajšnja opozicija gleda za dobro svojih državljanov in ne nabira poceni političnih točk.\n\nUčenje na daljavo bo morda potekalo po svetu še nekaj časa, medtem pa, ko se bodo vaši otroci v šolah samotestirali, ne pozabite, da to počenjajo zaradi svojega in vašega zdravja in zato, da se lahko šolajo v šolah. Medtem ko vas bodo ljudje drugačnega mišljenja o koronavirusu skušali prepričati o nasprotnem, se spomnite, da je zdravje tisto, kar je najbolj pomembno, vse ostalo pa so manipulacije in te ima leva opozicija še veliko v rokavu.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 0, "end": 63}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 0, "end": 23}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 36, "end": 50}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 443, "end": 467}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 498, "end": 512}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 689, "end": 789}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 711, "end": 721}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 724, "end": 730}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 733, "end": 751}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 754, "end": 775}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 781, "end": 789}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1024, "end": 1033}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1035, "end": 1117}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1105, "end": 1127}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1130, "end": 1281}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1345, "end": 1374}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1526, "end": 1656}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1660, "end": 1710}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 1751, "end": 1774}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1768, "end": 1774}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 1799, "end": 1927}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1799, "end": 1813}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1863, "end": 1881}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1980, "end": 2094}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 2097, "end": 2330}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2295, "end": 2330}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2333, "end": 2381}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 2384, "end": 2421}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2424, "end": 2555}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2436, "end": 2442}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2527, "end": 2555}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 2559, "end": 2600}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 2559, "end": 2600}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2603, "end": 2701}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 2704, "end": 2740}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2833, "end": 2888}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3098, "end": 3132}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3113, "end": 3132}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3147, "end": 3240}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3160, "end": 3185}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 3227, "end": 3240}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 3243, "end": 3407}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3304, "end": 3331}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 3411, "end": 3561}, {"tag": "Red_Herring", "start": 3467, "end": 3561}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3479, "end": 3561}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 3564, "end": 3592}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3640, "end": 3665}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3758, "end": 3773}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 3777, "end": 3917}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 3862, "end": 3917}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 3942, "end": 3946}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 3958, "end": 3962}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4011, "end": 4043}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 4046, "end": 4074}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 4077, "end": 4177}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4077, "end": 4177}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4180, "end": 4266}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4199, "end": 4205}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4208, "end": 4214}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4269, "end": 4280}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 4269, "end": 4291}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 4318, "end": 4327}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 4329, "end": 4402}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4405, "end": 4433}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 4436, "end": 4486}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4473, "end": 4486}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4492, "end": 4596}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4530, "end": 4543}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4548, "end": 4564}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 4567, "end": 4596}], "article_id": "4417", "lang": "sl", "text": "Evropa bo morala odrasti in se pred ruskim medvedom braniti sama\n\nŠimpanzi so naši najbližji sorodniki, s katerimi si delimo kar 98,6 odstotka DNK. Kot mi se smejijo, ohranjajo tesna prijateljstva, čutijo empatijo in celo razlikujejo med tako abstraktnima pojmoma, kot sta pravičnost in nepravičnost. Z nami pa si delijo še eno lastnost: teritorialnost, plemensko pripadnost in nagnjenost k vojskovanju med plemeni. Znanstveniki so bili priča divjim džungelskim vojnam, polnim nasilja, kjer je eno pleme šimpanzov vdrlo na ozemlje drugega, nato pa se je vnel boj, v katerem so si iztikali oči, trgali spolovila in okončine ter groteskno do smrti mučili zajete “vojake” sovražnega plemena. Nič drugačni niso kot Rdeči Kmeri, nacisti, mongolski osvajalci, bližnjevzhodni despoti ali komunisti. Videti je, kot da je neustavljiva želja po teritorialnih vojnah, nasilju in celo sadizmu globoko vtisnjena v našo bit in je starejša kot naša celotna vrsta – najbrž je enak nagon imel že skupni prednik šimpanzov in ljudi.\n\nPredvsem Zahodnjaki smo se zadnjih osem desetletij, pijani od dolgih let miru, zazibali v udoben spanec pacifizma. Pozabili smo, da ljudje niso le empatični delivci ljubezni in drugih prijetnih občutkov, ampak v svojem bistvu predvsem živali z močnim plemenskim čutom. Po drugi svetovni vojni so bili ljudje veliko bolj v stiku z mračnim delom človekovega duha: videli so prej običajne ljudi, ki so pobijali otroke, ženske, pohabljali vojake … Danes povprečen človek sredi Interspara v BTC seveda ne razmišlja, da je nekdo ob njem, ki prav zdaj izbira zmrznjeno pico, ob pravi priložnosti pripravljen ustreliti v glavo njega in njegove otroke.\n\nZato je zahodna politika postala politika pacifizma. Tanja Fajon bi ji rekla feministična. A takšen svet je iluzija. Februarja 2022 nas je ruski samodržec znova spomnil, da je bistvo mednarodnih odnosov igra moči in strahu, ne pa diplomacija in dobri odnosi med narodi. V Evropi smo se od tega dela človeštva oddaljili. Začeli smo verjeti, da lahko Ukrajini pomagamo z dobrimi besedami, zelenim prehodom in s pristopnimi pogajanji z EU. Zdaj, ko so ZDA Ukrajino zaradi republikanske blokade proračuna odrezali od streliva, utegne Rusija 44-milijonski narod v dveh letih zravnati z zemljo in ga spremeniti v vazalno državo, priključeno ruski kleptokratski kvazidemokraciji. Dobre želje Ursule von der Leyen ne bodo pomagale. Pomagalo bo le strelivo in prikaz moči. To razumejo mafijci v New Yorku, ki jih je Rudy Giuliani dokončno strl z uporabo brutalne moči države. To razume tudi Vladimir Putin.\n\nPotrebujemo močne politike in močno vojsko\n\nEvropejci smo na razpotju. Prav kmalu bomo po skoraj stoletju znova spoznali pravo naravo človeštva. Braniti pa se bomo očitno morali sami. (Najbrž) novi stari predsednik ZDA Donald Trump je že napovedal, da ne bo več dovolil, da evropske države počivajo na ameriškem vojaškem proračunu, zato bo zahteval, da vsaka članica za obrambo nameni vsaj 2 odstotka BDP. Prav tako je napovedal, da bo od EU zahteval povrnitev 200 milijard stroškov za orožje, ki je bilo namenjeno Ukrajini. Po eni strani gre za tipično Trumpovo nastopaštvo, po drugi za nadaljevanje mednarodnega izolacionizma iz njegovega prvega mandata pod geslom “America first”, a po svoje ima Trump prav: zakaj bi morale ZDA braniti svoje nehvaležne zahodne zaveznice, ki jo potem za hrbtom še obtožujejo hegemonije in orožarskega dobičkarstva.\n\nČas je, da tudi Evropa odraste in se začne zavedati, da ne živimo v svetu mavričnih zastav, samorogov in želja za svetovni mir s tekmovanj za mis sveta. Oborožiti se bomo morali sami. Tehnologijo imamo. Vsi stroji CMC, ki ženejo mašinerijo Putinove vojske, so narejeni v državah EU. Ruska federacija ima BDP srednje velike države. EU je za Rusijo ekonomski Goljat.\n\nV roku petih let lahko naredimo vojsko, ki ji lahko po moči parirajo le ZDA. Vojsko, ki bo tako mogočna, da Nata niti ne bomo več potrebovali. Zato bomo potrebovali močne politike: močne po vplivu, karizmi in odločnosti v kljubovanju sodobnim zarotniškim “mirovnikom” (najbrž jih financira Kremelj), ki bi radi Evropo razorožili tako, kot so slovenski socialisti želeli razorožiti teritorialno obrambo. V EU, ki jo vodijo scholzi, macroni in golobi tega sveta, se bomo oboroževali prepočasi. Ruski medved pa ne čaka. Na ruskih tankih piše: “в Берлин!” Zato bo naslednji krog volitev nacionalnih vlad odločal o usodi kontinenta. Na ZDA ne moremo več računati. Zdaj je čas, da EU odraste in spozna grenko resnico, da svet mednarodnih odnosov ni lep − kot svet podzemlja je mračen in sebičen, šteje pa le (orožarska) premoč.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 172, "end": 189}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 336, "end": 340}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 345, "end": 350}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 355, "end": 451}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 461, "end": 478}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 501, "end": 515}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 581, "end": 666}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 732, "end": 754}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 787, "end": 857}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1113, "end": 1161}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1261, "end": 1269}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1272, "end": 1317}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1356, "end": 1369}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1584, "end": 1591}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1655, "end": 1755}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1744, "end": 1755}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1802, "end": 1833}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 1877, "end": 1905}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2062, "end": 2186}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2199, "end": 2367}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2298, "end": 2365}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 2379, "end": 2390}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2512, "end": 2693}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2695, "end": 2819}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2738, "end": 2754}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2773, "end": 2793}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2802, "end": 2819}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 3101, "end": 3132}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 3287, "end": 3410}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3413, "end": 3536}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3633, "end": 3645}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3944, "end": 3953}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3962, "end": 3974}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3983, "end": 3995}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4082, "end": 4109}], "article_id": "4418", "lang": "sl", "text": "Ukrajina, moja dežela\n\nV dneh, ko je težko napisati kar koli smiselnega, smo poklicali na pomoč javni medijski servis Velike Britanije, tako tale zapisek nastaja ob pomoči znamenitega BBC-ja.\n\nRazmišljujoči se ob tragediji, ki se dogaja v Ukrajini, ne more znebiti vtisa, da gre za zelo veliko predstavo. Seveda je kot takšne ne vidijo žrtve in trpeči, a zunanji svet je začel tekmovati v obsodbah in pomoči, ki mnogokrat nima veliko zveze z realnostjo. Z neko navijaško strastjo opazujemo najnovejše evropsko klanje in z očitnimi pretiravanji sovražimo Ruse in ljubimo Ukrajince. Ne gre za racionalne izjave in obnašanje, temveč gre za čustvene, nepremišljene odzive, ki pa so – če smo brutalno iskreni – tudi pripeljali do vse te preklemanske šlamastike. Tako se tudi mi postavljamo v dolgo vrsto strokovnjakov za evropski Vzhod in geopolitičnih analitikov ter dodajamo kamenček k razumevanju najnovejše svetovne krize …\n\nNajprej poglejmo cvetober iz domačih logov.\n\nPrvič: Humanitarna kriza\n\n\"Sprejeli bomo do 200 000 beguncev,\" se je zavezal naš notranji minister. Pravilno, humano in potrebno, ampak zaveza, da postane vsak deseti živeči v Sloveniji begunec, se zdi nemogoča predvsem na osnovi reakcij sedanjih vladajočih izpred nekaj let, ko je obstajala nevarnost, da postane begunec vsak tisoči živeči v deželi. Argument, da so ukrajinski begunci \"pravi begunci\", pa kot tak ne zdrži kritične, kaj šele zdravorazumske presoje …\n\nDrugič: Vojaška pomoč\n\nV Ukrajino pošiljamo čelade in puške. Čemu pošiljamo puške, je menda razumljivo. Čeprav gre za stare kalašnikove, ki jih je štancala Crvena zastava in jih je povsod po vzhodnem bloku v izobilju. Medtem ko resne države pošiljajo v Ukrajino najnovejšo vojaško tehnologijo, mi pošiljamo staro železo. Ampak če razumemo, da mora Evropa oborožiti goloroko ukrajinsko prebivalstvo, ni najbolj jasno, čemu pošiljamo čelade. Kakšne čelade? Katere čelade? Vojaška čelada je namreč ob zaščiti vojakove glave tudi ultimativni prepoznavni znak posameznika na bojišču. Po njej se soborec razlikuje od sovražnika … In sodobne so izdelane iz kevlarja, po Toninovem kontingentu pa se zna zgoditi, da bodo Ukrajino branili pripadniki rajnke JLA. Pa še to; ko je Nemčija pred samim izbruhom krize hotela Ukrajincem kot vojaško pomoč poslati 9000 čelad, je ukrajinski obrambni minister Nemcem odgovoril, da se zagotovo šalijo …\n\nTretjič: Santo Subito\n\nZaradi vojne se nekatere države, Slovenija v prvih vrstah, zavzemajo za takojšnje sprejetje Ukrajine v Evropsko unijo. Čemu bi to storili in kako bi sprejetje Ukrajine v povezavo kakor koli pripomoglo k rešitvi konflikta, sploh pa k razrešitvi desetletja trajajočih napetosti, ki so privedle do njega? Razumevanje evropske povezave kot nekakšne tolažilne nagrade ali pa ogromnega geostrateškega obliža se zdi otročje in neresno. Če ne drugače, je eden glavnih pogojev sprejetja v povezavo odsotnost mejnih in medsosedskih konfliktov. Prav ta pogoj pa se je, resnici na ljubo, izgubil, ko so jedrne države začele v povezavo sprejemati države vzhodne in južne Evrope.\n\nČetrtič: Orožje za množično uničevanje\n\n\"Ne meč, pregnala nas bo sankcija,\" parafrazirano zveni v primeru ruske agresije na Ukrajino povsem verjetno. Če kaj, smo se naučili, da so najučinkovitejše orožje postali bančni računi. Tanki in puške delujejo zastarelo, primitivno in barbarsko, ko pa je največja strateška grožnja ukinitev medbančnega prometa. In prav na tej točki se je uštel tudi Putin. Prešteval je tanke namesto kreditov in zaupal je generalom namesto računovodjem. Človek nikoli povsem ne verjame, dokler ne vidi, ampak najverjetneje je prav vojna v Ukrajini kronski dokaz, da planeta že dolgo ne vodijo več posamezne države, temveč borza in korporacije.\n\nPetič: Tik tok\n\nBizarnost predpostavke, na kateri temeljijo družbena omrežja, se je v Ukrajini razgalila do konca. Namesto da bi nam neposredni prenosi bojev na digitalnih platformah vojno približali in posledično priskutili, so jo zbanalizirali. In jo zmanipulirali. Možnost, da se posnetek resnične vojne nadomesti s posnetkom iz videoigrice, pomeni resnični somrak civilizacije, v kateri sta realno in virtualno bivanje povsem izenačena. Razlika je le še v smrti … Se pravi, da je skoraj vse, kar je mogoče doživeti na ukrajinskih bojiščih, mogoče doživeti tudi v udobju dnevne sobe.

Morebiten neuspeh Zahoda kot enega od globalnih blokov bi dolgoročno lahko tlakoval pot v pekel vsem nam. V zadnjih dneh razkrita ozadja konflikta namreč ne obetajo nič dobrega.\n\nVemo, kdo je kriv za neuspeh protiofenzive\n\nNedavno je ukrajinsko protiofenzivo kot neuspešno označil celo predsednik Volodimir Zelenski, medtem ko se je načelnik generalštaba Valerij Zalužni na široko razpisal o neperspektivnosti nadaljevanja bojevanja po dosedanjem modelu. To smo že pred kake pol leta vedeli vsi in za neuspeh največji del krivde nosi Zahod. Preveč je bilo obotavljanja in obljub s figo v žepu. Govorim o strelivu za težka orožja, Leopardih, Abramsih, HIMARS-ih, ATACMS-ih in lovskih letalih. Dali so premalo in prepozno. Zakaj torej, če naj bi se na ukrajinskem bojišču odločalo o usodi sveta?\n\nSplošno sprejeto stališče je bilo, da Zahod Ukrajini ni zaupal, prvič, ker bi lahko z naprednimi sistemi delovali na občutljive ruske cilje ter s tem sprožili jedrsko vojno, ter drugič, v primeru ukrajinskega poraza bi velike količine zahodne tehnologije prišle v ruske roke. V tedaj javno znani paradigmi razumljivo; neizkušeni ukrajinski vrh bi lahko vojno pošteno zavozil. A niso povedali vsega. Tudi tega ne, da je skorajšnje premirje v režiji Turčije, ki bi lahko rešilo večino ozemeljske celovitosti Ukrajine in na deset tisoče življenj, padlo v vodo.\n\nVelik potencial pogajanj\n\nSicer nisem njegov navijač, a predsednik Erdogan je tedaj resnično storil vse, kar je bilo v njegovi moči, da bi med sprtima stranema zavladalo trajno premirje. Ukrajinsko delegacijo je tedaj vodil predsednik poslanske skupine stranke Zelenskega David Arahamija. Gruzijec je za ukrajinsko televizijo 1+1 nedavno podal intervju, v katerem razkriva podrobnosti lani spomladi dogovorjenega premirja, ki je bilo glede na nadaljnji razvoj dogodkov za obe strani zelo, zelo ugodno.\n\nUkrajina bi obdržala svoje celotno ozemlje razen Krima, Donbas bi dobil avtonomijo in ruščina status enega od uradnih jezikov, Ukrajinci pa bi se zavezali k nevtralnosti. V bistvu bi ponovno uveljavili protokol Minsk II, za izvajanje pa bi skrbela Nemčija in Varnostni svet OZN. Da je do dogovora dejansko prišlo, je med drugimi potrdil tudi nemški kancler Olaf Scholz.\n\nDanes se takšen scenarij sliši sanjsko in verjeti je, da sta se tedaj za njegovo uveljavitev zavzemali obe strani. Ukrajina še ni imela vzpostavljenih logističnih tokov, posedovala pa je vsekakor premalo sredstev za resno vojno. Na drugi strani so Rusi tvegali točno to, kar se jim je kasneje zgodilo: ogromne človeške izgube, finančno ter materialno izčrpavanje in izobčenje s strani Zahoda ob velikih domačih političnih težavah.\n\nUkrajina je sicer imela pomisleke in je za pristop k dogovoru zahtevala varnostne garancije. Kdor je že kdaj slepo zaupal Moskvi, ve, kako se je romanca končala, in tako bi lahko nevtralna Ukrajina v primeru vojne ostala na suhem. Obstajala je namreč velika verjetnost, da Kremelj kljub dogovoru izzove nove vstaje v LNR in DNR. Za varnostna zagotovila v slogu Natovega petega člena bi na ukrajinsko zahtevo skrbele tako Rusija in Kitajska kot tudi ZDA, Nemčija, Kanada, Velika Britanija, Francija, Italija, Poljska, Izrael in Turčija. Glede na resnost in interese nedvomno pravi izbor držav, ki bi z uravnoteženjem interesov lahko zagotovile dolgoročno varnost.\n\nNiso hoteli ali niso smeli podpisati?\n\nA Kijev je kmalu odstopil od dogovora. Kot razloge je slišati različne navedbe, ki pa jim je težko verjeti. Ena je, denimo, da bi morali spreminjati ustavo ter iz nje izvzeti zastavljeni vstop v NATO. Ustava se s takšno enotnostjo, kot jo ima trenutno Verhovna rada, spremeni v nekaj dneh. Še posebno, če prepreči grozote vojne. Drugi razlog naj bi bila grozodejstva v Buči; Ukrajinci naj bi se zaradi njih ne bili več pripravljeni pogovarjati z Rusi. A tudi v tem ni logike: premirje bi takšna grozodejstva lahko le preprečilo, vojna pa jih je zagotovo pomnožila. In ob premirju bi Rusija dobila možnost recimo temu »častnega« izhoda iz konflikta, kot je v začetku vojne svetoval nekdanji šef britanske MI6. Za storjeno bi se lahko celo pokesala (verjetno se ne bi, a to možnost bi imela) in skupaj s pajdaši dala obsoditi tistega Kirgiza, ki je poveljeval zločinski brigadi.\n\nKot sem že večkrat izpostavljal, so odločitve Kijeva podrejene dejavnikom iz tujine. S podrejenostjo so pogojena sredstva, s katerimi se Ukrajina lahko bojuje za svobodo. Farrell na tem mestu celo trdi, da Zahod noče popolne ukrajinske zmage. To seveda ne velja za kakšne Poljake ali Fince, ampak za tiste, ki trenutno odločajo. Z veliko tesnobe moram temu vsaj delno pritrditi, saj dejstva govorijo temu v prid.\n\nKmalu za tem, ko sta v Turčiji strani dosegli dogovor, je v Kijev nenapovedano priletel tedanji britanski premier Boris Johnson ter dejal, naj Ukrajina sploh ničesar ne podpiše, naj se le bojuje. Tako se je tudi zgodilo.\n\nKljub temu, da to niso iz trte izvite zgodbe, saj o njih ne pišejo neki obskurni »resnicoljubni« mediji v službi Moskve, temveč ugledni portali, kot so Business Insider, Newsweek in Financial Times, pa tudi Jerusalem Post ali The Times of Israel, je večina politike in diplomacije na Zahodu tiho. V Ukrajni pa je v medijih (Kyiv Post, Kyiv Independent) moč slediti odkriti debati o usodi vojne, naroda in države. In marsikatera ukrajinska ugotovitev Zahoda ne prikazuje v tako lepi luči, kod bi ga lahko, če bi se ta preudarneje obnašal.\n\nUkrajinci z vse manj podpore, Rusi v totalno vojno?\n\nVidi se, da sta narod in politika nezadovoljna, in s tesnobo se vsi sprašujejo, do kdaj bo še trajala zahodna podpora Ukrajini. Kyiv Independent je, denimo, objavil podkast z naslovom »Ali Ukrajina izgublja vojno?«. V tej fazi je vojaško sicer ne izgublja, ker nobena stran ni sposobna priti čez utrjene položaje druge strani. Pomembno pa je, da gledamo srednje in dolgoročno. Tu pa je pomembna tudi geopolitika, ki izhaja iz pričujoče vojne.\n\nV omenjenem podkastu tako Frances Farrell pove, da je bil primarni cilj Zahoda izčrpati Rusijo do stopnje nezmožnosti vojaških operacij izven svojih meja. Temu verjamem, saj gre nenazadnje za nesporni nauk Sun Cuja in malo sodobnejšega von Clausewitza. A napačno je bilo mišljenje, da bo Rusija ostala samostojen dejavnik. Kot taka se je v resnici dodobra izčrpala in je izgubila svoj dosedanji status in vpliv, a je postala del protizahodnega bloka skupaj s Kitajsko in velikim delom muslimanskega sveta. Zahod je v tem primeru intelektualno zatajil in ni pokazal nikakršne strateške ali državniške modrosti.\n\nRusija se po poročanju The Telegrapha pripravlja na totalno vojno s predvidenimi vojaškimi izdatki v višini 10 % BDP za leto 2023. V tej fazi vrnitev na čas pogajanj politično ni več možna. Medtem pa, ko mi Zahodnjaki ugotavljamo, katerega od 369 spolov je kdo, se nasprotni blok resno oborožuje. Naša krivulja na grafu moči drastično pada, njihova pa že lep čas raste.\n\nKot sem predvideval že pred časom, Ukrajinci počasi ostajajo brez podpore in brez orožja, predvsem sedaj, ko se pozornost preusmerja na Bližnji Vzhod. V teh temnih časih ukrajinski narodni boj proti ruskemu škornju podpiram bolj kot kadar koli prej. Enako velja za Zahod: napake slednjega izpostavljam, ker moramo biti iskreni in se izboljšati. Zavajati pa je treba nasprotnika, ne lastne strani.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 0, "end": 54}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 460, "end": 828}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 642, "end": 666}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1374, "end": 1400}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1547, "end": 1577}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1557, "end": 1577}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2034, "end": 2165}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 2244, "end": 2336}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2312, "end": 2336}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 2393, "end": 2419}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2395, "end": 2401}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2734, "end": 2770}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 2790, "end": 3003}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3194, "end": 3363}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3197, "end": 3225}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3413, "end": 3421}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3424, "end": 3620}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3690, "end": 3708}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 3780, "end": 3831}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3893, "end": 3996}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 3931, "end": 3942}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3976, "end": 3990}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 3999, "end": 4133}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4050, "end": 4114}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 4136, "end": 4228}], "article_id": "442", "lang": "sl", "text": "STA in Hamasova konstrukcija bližnjevzhodne resničnosti\n\nNedavno slovo sociologa, profesorja in nekdanjega direktorja RTV Slovenija dr. Janeza Jerovška, ki je bil tudi dolgoletni kolumnist medija, ki ga prav zdaj berete, me je spomnilo na nekatere epizode iz novejše zgodovine slovenskih medijev. Dr. Jerovšek je namreč pred dobrimi dvajsetimi leti prizadevno sodeloval v projektu Zavoda za oživitev civilne družbe glede ocene in poročila slovenskih medijev.\n\nSkupina, v kateri so poleg Jerovška med drugim sodelovali tudi mag. Andrej Aplenc (prav tako naš kolumnist), hrvaški akademik dr. Josip Županov, sedaj že pokojni pesnik Dane Zajc (»…pride čas, ko ni več časa …«) in še mnogi drugi, je tako že v času Bajukove vlade in v obdobju zadnje Drnovškove vlade primerjalno in kritično ocenila tedanje delovanje slovenskih medijev. Skupno je o tem obdobju izšlo 24 člankov, ki so nato izšli v okviru revije Dignitas pod tematskim naslovom »Medijska konstrukcija slovenske realnosti«.\n\nSeveda je to, kar je sledilo objavi te publikacije, v marsičem še preseglo problematiko obdobja 2000−2002. Verjamem, da bi imela omenjena skupina v okviru Zavoda za oživitev civilne družbe še ogromno dela, tudi če bi pod drobnogled vzeli samo dva medija, ki ju financiramo davkoplačevalci – to pa sta RTV Slovenija in Slovenska tiskovna agencija (STA). Dva javna medijska servisa torej, ki naj bi bila zaupanja vredna. Prav v zvezi z delovanjem Zavoda za oživitev civilne družbe in STA pa se je leta 2001 uredništvu Demokracije (in avtorju kolumne, ki jo berete) pripetila precej huda nerodnost. Ko smo namreč oddajali revijo v tisk in smo morali zadnji hip v revijo vnesti kratko novico o tiskovni konferenci zavoda, smo zaradi stiske s časom povzeli agencijsko novico STA o tem dogodku. Nerodno pa je bilo, ker je ta agencijska vest navajala kritično stališče pisatelja Draga Jančarja o delovanju ministrstva za kulturo. Mnenje torej, ki ga v resnici ni bilo, ker Draga Jančarja (kot nam je kasneje sam povedal) v resnici sploh ni bilo tam – kajti novinar(ka) STA, ki je ta dogodek pokrival(a), očitno ni ločil(a) med Jančarjem in Danetom Zajcem, ki je v resnici izrekel to mnenje. Žal smo bili o napaki obveščeno prepozno, takrat, ko je revija že izšla. In smo se zaradi (prevelikega) zaupanja v kakovost javnega servisa STA osramotili pred javnostjo. Opravičila in popravka STA nismo nikoli dočakali, ker v Butalah vedno »vse štima«.\n\nNa to dokaj žalostno anekdoto sem se spomnil, ko sem pred kratkim pregledoval spletni portal STA in spremljal novice z Bližnjega vzhoda. »Izrael napadel bolnišnico«, »Izrael napadel begunsko taborišče« in podobni naslovi zadnje čase spet izstopajo in vzbujajo v slovenski javnosti veliko ogorčenje zaradi menda brezobzirne in objestne maščevalnosti izraelske vojske, ki ves čas povračilno napada civiliste v Gazi, medtem ko izraelsko vlado Združeni narodi že skoraj na kolenih prosijo, naj vendar vsaj malo prekinejo ogenj, da bodo lahko dostavili humanitarno pomoč obupanim ljudem. Da, takšno sliko o dogajanju na Bližnjem vzhodu dobi povprečen Slovenec, če spremlja dominantne medije, zlasti programe RTV Slovenija. Če pa te novice natančno preberete, lahko vidite, da se slovenski medijski mainstream vedno sklicuje na podatke, ki jih iz Gaze posredujejo »tamkajšnje oblasti«, ki so očitno edini vir informacij o tem, kaj se v Gazi dogaja. In kdo so »tamkajšnje  oblasti«? Kajpak Hamas, skrajneži, ki imajo tam absolutno oblast in si za talce jemljejo vse tamkajšnje civiliste (več o tem sem pisal v kolumni »Kaj ima Hamas opraviti z Dražgošami«) ter želijo brezkompromisno doseči izbris Izraela. Slovenska javnost torej prejema informacije, ki jih v svet pošilja Hamasova propaganda – ne da bi imeli dostop do celovite slike o dogajanju na tem območju. Takšen način poročanja seveda spodbuja antisemitizem, pa ne samo pri nas, ampak tudi drugje po Evropi in svetu.\n\nKot kristjanu mi nikakor ni vseeno za nove in nove žrtve civilistov v tej nedvomno izjemno umazani vojni. A resnice o tem, kdo in kaj je v resnici Hamas ter kako brez zadržkov žrtvuje civilno prebivalstvo za lastne potrebe, ne smemo zatajiti. Gaza (in z njo vsi Palestinci) bo dosegla mir, šele ko se bo prebivalstvo samo odreklo Hamasu. Nič prej.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6, "end": 39}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 46, "end": 69}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 72, "end": 112}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 118, "end": 134}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 328, "end": 351}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 583, "end": 610}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 612, "end": 616}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 812, "end": 827}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 1252, "end": 1286}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 1292, "end": 1336}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1401, "end": 1473}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 1772, "end": 1793}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2103, "end": 2121}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2124, "end": 2150}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 2154, "end": 2196}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2479, "end": 2598}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 3076, "end": 3104}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3131, "end": 3149}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3154, "end": 3175}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4026, "end": 4034}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4065, "end": 4088}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 4091, "end": 4131}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4137, "end": 4153}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 4242, "end": 4268}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 4271, "end": 4293}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 4314, "end": 4516}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 4520, "end": 4538}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4541, "end": 4647}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 4650, "end": 4663}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4666, "end": 4809}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 4812, "end": 4825}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4828, "end": 4916}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 4919, "end": 4935}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4937, "end": 4951}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4954, "end": 5061}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5065, "end": 5569}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 5071, "end": 5080}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 5108, "end": 5117}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5127, "end": 5130}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 5188, "end": 5197}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 5265, "end": 5274}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5362, "end": 5458}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 5461, "end": 5470}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 5573, "end": 5582}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5573, "end": 5959}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 5660, "end": 5669}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5733, "end": 5750}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 5753, "end": 5765}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 5963, "end": 5995}], "article_id": "4420", "lang": "sl", "text": "Zakaj ima Janša raje Orbana kot Ukrajino\n\nMed prijatelji iz Budimpešte, ki so si zelo dobri z Vladimirjem Putinom, in tistimi iz Kijeva, ki jim isti Putin odreka pravico do obstoja, države in jezika, je Janez Janša izbral prve.\n\nKo so ruski tanki februarja 2022 šli proti Kijevu, je bil Janez Janša predsednik vlade, ki se je – in to je bilo edino prav – odločno postavila na stran napadene države. Slovenija je Ukrajini pomagala s sprejetjem ljudi, ki so pobegnili pred vojno, denarjem in vojaško opremo. Tudi po zamenjavi oblasti je naša država ostala v taboru tistih, ki Ukrajino pri njeni pravici do obrambe trdno podpirajo in ji na različne načine pomagajo. Podarila ji je več deset oklepnih vozil, financirala nakupe zdravil in obnove bolnišnic, poskrbela za šolanje otrok, ki so postali begunci. In spet: to je edino prav.\n\nPri vsem skupaj je šel Janša še korak dlje. Danes se le malokdo spomni, da je v prvih dneh po začetku vojne nosil kravato in zapestnico v barvah ukrajinske zastave. Ali pa, da je tik pred ruskim napadom želel sam obiskati Kijev, zato sta morala tja na hitro odpotovati uslužbenka protokola in varnostni inšpektor, ki so ju morali pozneje reševati iz zaklonišča.\n\nJanša je hodil na shode v podporo Ukrajine, govoril je o \"nekaznovanem zlu, ki se vedno vrne\", in Ukrajincih, ki \"so na pravi strani zgodovine\". V \"pogumu Ukrajincev, ki se goloroki postavljajo pred tanke\", je prepoznal slovensko osamosvojitveno vojno iz leta 1991 in s tem – sebe. Strankarska televizija SDS se je odela v ukrajinske barve, Janša pa je bil v prvi ekspediciji tujih državnikov, ki je marca 2022 z vlakom odpotovala v Kijev. Na tamkajšnji aveniji pogumnih ima od lani spominsko ploščo.\n\nLeto dni pozneje se je Janša spet odpravil v Kijev. To vojno je označil za \"boj dobrega proti zlu\". Evropo je pozval k povečanju pomoči. \"S tem, ko vojna traja, zahodne pomoči ni dovolj, Rusija pa se je tudi prilagodila razmeram, ni tako optimistična, kot je mogoče videti od daleč. Ko številni mislijo, da zdaj Ukrajinci lahko vse sami naredijo,\" je govoril ob aplavzih gostiteljev.\n\nToda potem je Janša, \"največji Ukrajinec\", naposled srečal samega sebe.\n\nMadžarska ima vedno prav. Tudi pri Ukrajini.\n\nV ponedeljek, med tradicionalnim pogovorom z opozicijo na RTV Slovenija, sta ga Tanja Starič in Gregor Drnovšek vprašala tudi, kako ocenjuje ravnanje madžarskega premierja Viktorja Orbana, ki je v nočnih urah na vrhu EU blokiral dodelitev finančne pomoči Ukrajini.\n\nOrban namreč kot edini od 27 voditeljev držav članic EU na vrhu v Bruslju ni podprl dogovora o rebalansu dolgoročnega proračuna Unije, ker mu ta zaradi kršitev vladavine prava in drugih demokratičnih vrednost zadržuje izplačilo 21 milijard evrov evropskih sredstev. S tem do nadaljnjega ostaja blokiranih 50 milijard evrov posojil in nepovratnih sredstev, ki jih je EU namenila Ukrajini.\n\nSeveda bi pričakovali, da bi se nek politik, ki je še nekaj mesecev prej Zahod ob lastni spominski plošči v Kijevu pozival, naj poveča pomoč, odločno postavil na stran 26 voditeljev EU. Sploh nekdo, ki ves čas govori, da Ukrajina \"ne sme ostati sama\". A ko je to Janša, tista črna ovca v Bruslju pa njegov prijatelj Orban, tudi navidezna logika odpove.\n\nA Starič in Drnovšek sta dobila povsem drugačen odgovor. \"Madžarska seveda zelo težko glasuje za to, da gre ta denar, ki ga oni ne dobijo, zdaj neki državi, ki niti še ni članica,\" jima je razložil Janša. In še: \"Ko gre pa za vladavino prava, na Madžarskem ni, mislim, da ne samo, da ni noben opozicijski politik v zaporu, tudi nobenega sodnega postopka ni proti kakšnemu opozicijskemu politiku. V nasprotju s tem, kar je na primer v Španiji, pa ta dobiva sredstva, ali kar je bilo v Sloveniji, pa je tudi Slovenija dobivala sredstva. Tako da v odnosu do Madžarske, deloma Poljske, motijo dvojna merila.\"\n\nV dilemi, ali ima raje, da si Orban še naprej podreja pravosodje, regulatorje in medije, ali da Ukrajina, ki se je pred dnevi odločila za mobilizacijo novih pol milijona mož, dobi težko pričakovano pomoč, se je prvak SDS odločil za prvo možnost. Med prijatelji iz Budimpešte, ki so si zelo dobri z Vladimirjem Putinom, in tistimi iz Kijeva, ki jim isti Putin odreka pravico do obstoja, jezika in države, je Janša izbral prve.\n\nUkrajina ne sme ostati sama. Razen, če to želi Orban.\n\nJasno je, zakaj. Lahko, da Janši srce res bije za Kijev. Lahko, da res iskreno govori o \"dobrem\" Kijevu in \"zlu\" Moskvi. Lahko, da v ruskih tankih vidi tanke JLA, v Bakmutu Krakovski gozd, v Volodomirju Zelenskem pa sebe.\n\nToda Orban je tisti, čigar krog poslovnežev je v zadnjem desetletju v propagandni aparat SDS vložil deset in več milijonov evrov. Orban je tisti, ki je v Sloveniji \"iz posla SDS\" odkupoval drage ventilatorje, ki mu je Janša prodajal Planet TV, ki je hotel graditi drugi tir in mega-plinovod. Orban je tisti, ki je hodil na kongrese SDS, njegov zet pa skušal privatizirati največje slovenske hotele. In Orban je tisti edini prijatelj, ki je Janši v EU ostal po volilnem porazu Jarosława Kaczyńskega in njegovega projekta teokracije na Poljskem.\n\nTo je isti Orban, ki redno hodi v Kremelj. Isti Orban, ki mu \"zli\" Rusi na Madžarskem gradijo dve novi jedrski elektrarni. Isti Orban, ki z Moskvo sodeluje v politično-obveščevalnih igrah na Balkanu. Isti Orban, ki se brati z Miloradom Dodikom, ključnim ruskim igralcem v Bosni in Hercegovini, in Aleksandrom Vučićem, čigar stranka je v Srbiji pravkar dobila še ene volitve, polne nepravilnosti.

Ob tem je izpostavil tudi vnovičen porast zabeleženih primerov opičjih koz na celini.\n\nWHO je na začetku maja odpravila izredne razmere zaradi covida-19, ki je po ocenah generalnega direktorja organizacije Tedrosa Adhanoma Ghebreyesusa kriv za smrt 20 milijonov ljudi v zadnjih treh letih. To je trikrat več smrti, kot jih beležijo uradne statistike.\n\nDa je število smrti zaradi covida tudi sedaj višje od uradnih, je prepričan Kluge, ki je opozoril, da vse manj držav redno poroča o smrtih v zvezi s covidom. V tej luči je oblasti 53 držav evropske regije WHO pozval, naj poskrbijo za vsaj 70-odstotno precepljenost ranljivih skupin prebivalstva.\n\nPo njegovih ocenah je okoli 36 milijonov ljudi v regiji trpelo ali še trpi za posledicami t. i. dolgega covida. \"To je 1 od 30 oseb, ki se morda še vedno težko vrnejo v normalno življenje,\" je dodal Kluge.\n\n\"Če ne bomo razvili celovite diagnostike in zdravljenja dolgotrajnega covida, si od pandemije ne bomo nikoli zares opomogli,\" je še povedal Belgijec in pozval k dodatnim raziskavam na tem področju.\n\nNa novinarski konferenci je pozornost namenil še dvema javnozdravstvenima grožnjama, in sicer opičjim kozam ter visokim poletnim temperaturam. Slednje so minulo poletje samo v evropski regiji WHO terjale 20.000 življenj.\n\nV Združenem kraljestvu, Belgiji, Španiji in na Nizozemskem pa so zdravstvene oblasti maja naštele 22 primerov novih okužb z opičjimi kozami. \"Čeprav se zdi ta številka nizka, nam pove, da virus v Evropi še vedno kroži, zlasti med moškimi, ki imajo spolne odnose z moškimi,\" je dejal Kluge in opozoril na nevarnost novih izbruhov te bolezni.\n\nWHO je maja sicer sporočila, da opičje koze oziroma mpox, kot so v angleščini preimenovali to bolezen, niso več grožnja svetovnemu zdravju. Do razglasitve konca nevarnosti je prišlo nekaj manj kot leto dni po tem, ko se je bolezen začela širiti zunaj endemičnih območij zahodne in osrednje Afrike.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag":

Negovati jo je treba vsak dan in na vseh ravneh.\n\nEnaindvajseti september je dan miru. Pred dobrimi 40 leti so se države članice ZN soglasno z resolucijo zavezale, da se na ta dan vse človeštvo kljub razlikam med nami zaveže k miru in da vsi pripomoremo h gradnji kulture miru. Poziv k miru je letos še posebno aktualen. Napad Rusije na Ukrajino je katastrofa. Ves svet je skoraj enotno obsodil agresijo Rusije in to je prav. Žal pa obe strani napovedujeta še dolgo vojno in na koncu svojo zmago. Kako v takšnih razmerah prispevati k zavezi o gradnji kulture miru?\n\nRetorika zahodnih politikov je letos v močnem nasprotju s to zavezo. Najvišji zahodni politiki trdijo, da je treba Rusijo vojaško premagati. Zdi se, da Zahod ne išče miroljubne rešitve. Pozive k diplomatski rešitvi mnogi oznanjajo kot rusofilstvo. Ali vodilni zahodni politiki res vidijo edino rešitev v vojni? Kako razumeti, ko Zahod namesto diplomatov pošilja v konflikt več orožja? Ali se Zahod zaveda, da je z gospodarskimi sankcijami proti Rusiji in pošiljanjem orožja v Ukrajino osamljen? Večina držav se temu ne pridružuje, čeprav agresijo Rusije obsojajo.\n\nV geopolitiki gre navadno za dva segmenta. Prvi, so gospodarske koristi. Morda se prav zaradi tega vzroka večina držav ne odloča za vojaško podpiranje Ukrajine. Počasi pa tudi Evropejcem postaja jasno, da se računica z gospodarskimi sankcijami proti Rusiji za EU ne izide. Rubelj je močnejši, kot je bil pred začetkom ruske agresije, Gazprom pa ima izjemne dobičke zaradi ponorelih cen energentov in dodatnega izvoza Kitajski, Indiji ter drugim. Za EU ni problem samo prihajajoča zima, temveč dolgoročno s tako drago energijo EU ne more gospodarsko preživeti.\n\nDrugi razlog v geopolitiki naj bi bila načela. V tem primeru demokracija. Zahodni politiki utemeljujejo svoje pozive k vojaški zmagi nad Rusijo, češ da tako branimo našo demokracijo. Ali je to res najboljši način? Ali se politiki zavedajo, da je samo polovica mladih Evropejcev v starosti od 16 do 26 let prepričanih, da je demokracija najboljša oblika družbe, kot v mnenjski raziskavi ugotavlja agencija YouGov. Ali ne bi bilo bolje, da se politiki najprej v EU potrudijo in tudi mlade prepričajo, da demokracija v EU dobro deluje? Če jim to ne uspe, bo v EU prevladal nevarni nacionalizem, populizem ter sovraštvo do drugih držav in narodov. Idealna podlaga za konflikte in vojno.\n\nAli pa morda obstaja še tretji razlog? Interesi vojaške industrije? Interesi ZDA ter tudi Rusije in Kitajske, da oslabijo EU? Dolar je postal močnejši kot evro. Ves svet kupuje orožje, največje proizvajalke pa so ameriške korporacije. Ali je mogoče, da evropski politiki ne bi sprevideli takšnih tendenc?\n\nKaj pa znani razumniki menijo o vojni v Ukrajini? Ameriški profesor Noam Chomsky trdi, da ZDA ne pustijo ustaviti vojne v Ukrajini, ker to ustreza ameriškim interesom, EU pa naj bi z uboganjem ZDA škodovala sebi. Papež Frančišek je eden redkih razumnikov na Zahodu, ki govori o miru in poziva, da se v koaliciji z drugimi povežemo v gibanje za svetovni mir. Ekonomist Jeffrey Sachs, nekdanji politik Henry Kissinger, številni nekdanji zahodni diplomati, nekateri bivši ameriški generali in množica poznavalcev poudarja, da je politika Zahoda do Rusije popolnoma zgrešena. Trdijo, da oboroževanje Ukrajine ter Tajvana tem državam ne prinaša varnosti, ampak jim bolj škodi. Trdijo, da zahodna politika svet vse bolj potiska v vojno, ki se lahko konča z jedrskim obračunom in samouničenjem. Trdijo, da bi vojno v Ukrajini lahko in morali preprečiti z diplomacijo. Trdijo, da bi to bilo mogoče, če se ZDA in Nato ne bi vedli tako izzivalno in arogantno ter ne bi povečali napetosti. Ali je mogoče, da se vsi ti razumniki motijo?\n\nDa, vsi se motijo, pravijo nekateri zagrizeni posamezniki, ki vidijo v vojni zmagi edino pot. Problem pa nastopi, ko nekdo brez protiargumentov razglasi dejstva za lažne novice. Zanj tudi poročila uglednih ustanov, pa naj bodo to Združeni narodi, Beneška komisija ali statistični podatki nimajo nobene teže. V sedanjih razmerah smo izpostavljeni takšnim trendom bolj kot običajno. Res je, da je v vsaki vojni enoumje informacij običajna stvar. Zdi se, da je trenutno na Zahodu geopolitika postala črno-bela. Ena stran je vir zla, druga stran je žrtev, ki nikoli ne dela napak.\n\nUkrajinci skrbno zbirajo dokaze o vojnih zločinih, ki naj bi jih izvajala ruska vojska. To je prav in vsi zločini, ki jih povzroči vojna, bi morali biti kaznovani. Upajmo, da bodo zločini, ki jih izvaja ruska vojska v Ukrajini in tisti, ki so za te zločine odgovorni, končali na sodišču. Ne tako kot Julian Assange in Wikileaks, ki je, potem ko je razkril zločine ameriške vojske v Iraku, končal sam v zaporu in je postal v očeh ZDA »izdajalec«. Ali gre pri obsojanju vojnih zločinov za enaka merila, ko jih izvaja Rusija in ko jih izvajajo ZDA?\n\nAli je mir res iluzija v situaciji, ko imamo opravka z rusko agresijo? Ni dvoma, da čim dalj časa politiki vztrajajo, da je treba nasprotnika premagati, tem večje so žrtve. Ko se izkaže, da več orožja pomeni le več mrtvih, privrženci vojne trdijo, da je potrebno še več orožja. Bob Dylan bi jih vprašal: »Koliko smrti bo potrebnih, da ugotoviš, da je umrlo preveč ljudi?«\n\nMir je zelo občutljiva vrednota. Negovati jo je treba vsak dan in na vseh ravneh. Poziv politikov k diplomatski rešitvi ne pa k vojaški zmagi bi bil prvi prispevek h gradnji kulture miru, kot so se zavezali v ZN. Ali bi bil mogoč razcvet EU, če se distancira od Nata in odstrani vse jedrske konice iz Evrope? Brez dvoma bi to bila gradnja kulture miru.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 27, "end": 59}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 27, "end": 43}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 129, "end": 138}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 154, "end": 174}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 228, "end": 275}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 230, "end": 237}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 259, "end": 275}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 387, "end": 409}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 412, "end": 469}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 458, "end": 469}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 583, "end": 713}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 583, "end": 713}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 730, "end": 740}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 744, "end": 1236}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1035, "end": 1043}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1092, "end": 1236}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1241, "end": 1332}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1299, "end": 1497}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1409, "end": 1418}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1500, "end": 1887}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 1500, "end": 1665}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1604, "end": 1624}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1692, "end": 1699}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 1960, "end": 1995}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1960, "end": 1995}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1967, "end": 1975}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2114, "end": 2121}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2129, "end": 2160}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2129, "end": 2145}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2244, "end": 2268}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2279, "end": 2313}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2316, "end": 2443}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2469, "end": 2483}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2469, "end": 2563}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2566, "end": 2614}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2617, "end": 2684}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 2691, "end": 2757}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2691, "end": 2757}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2723, "end": 2757}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2813, "end": 2989}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2992, "end": 3005}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3008, "end": 3154}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3014, "end": 3022}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3109, "end": 3116}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3118, "end": 3154}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3118, "end": 3128}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3157, "end": 3290}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3211, "end": 3218}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3505, "end": 3651}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 3654, "end": 3791}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 3794, "end": 3880}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 3883, "end": 4143}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 4224, "end": 4357}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 4259, "end": 4357}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 4370, "end": 4444}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4447, "end": 4500}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4452, "end": 4476}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 4503, "end": 4541}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 4503, "end": 4541}], "article_id": "4423", "lang": "sl", "text": "Na žalost smo imeli prav. »Kultura posilstev je že med nami«!\n\nV četrtek, 30. avgusta 2018, smo na naslovnici revije Demokracija simbolično objavili roke nezakonitih migrantov, ki otipavajo mlado belopolto žensko, in zapisali: »Z migranti v Slovenijo prihaja kultura posilstev.« Zaradi tega je bil naš takratni gl. in odg. urednik Jože Biščak deležen medijskih napadov. Bil je dobesedno pribit na medijski križ, uredništvo Demokracije pa je bilo označeno za rasističnega.\n\nDruštvo slovenskih pisateljev (DSP) je celo napisalo izjavo, v kateri je zatrjevalo, da si je naše uredništvo »privoščilo nekaj, česar si v normalni družbi, ki skrbi za kakovost pravne države in zaščito človekovega dostojanstva, ne bi smelo«. In še dodatno pomodrovalo: »Od družbeno relevantnega časnika bi pričakovali odstiranje problemov družbenega življenja, ki zadevajo običajno družbeno odrinjene ljudi, ali pa predstavljanje ljudi, ki težijo k odličnosti pri delu, znanju in etični drži. S tem ko vas, spoštovani urednik, pozivamo k opravičilu, pa ne samo migrantom, pač pa slovenskim državljanom, ter zahtevamo, da svoj jezik uravnovesite s civilizacijskimi standardi, ki vladajo na ozemlju Republike Slovenije, pozivamo tudi k spoštovanju evropskih vrednot.«\n\nZanimiv poziv, a pri DSP bi ga morali nasloviti na tiste, ki nezakonito vstopajo v Slovenijo in prihajajo iz civilizacij, ki se močno razlikujejo od naše, in se ob tem požvižgajo na evropske vrednote, kar ne nazadnje kaže dogajanje pri nas v zadnjih mesecih. Kriminal in število posilstev se v Ljubljani povečujeta, kar je neposredna posledica povečanega števila nezakonitih migrantov tako v Ljubljani kot drugje po Sloveniji. Sredi oktobra so štirje migranti v podhodu na Vilharjevi cesti pri glavni železniški postaji pretepli moškega in posilili žensko, prejšnji teden sta dva Maročana skušala posiliti žensko na zelenici na ljubljanskem Taboru. Na družabnih omrežjih je čedalje več zapisov, ki kažejo, da se ljudje zaradi migrantov ne čutijo več varne. Kolega Jože Biščak je zato pretekli teden na naši spletni strani zapisal: »Danes vemo, da smo imeli prav. Imeli smo prekleto prav. Kultura posilstev je že med nami, seme je bilo spuščeno v času, ko smo opozarjali na nevarnost (najbrž že prej). A neusmiljeno bombardiranje vrhunsko organizirane progresivne propagande, katere namen je, da staroselce pod Alpami prepriča, kako nas bodo prihajajoči z drugih celin obogatili in nam pomagali preživeti, je naredilo svoje. /…/ Trend posilstev seveda ni centralno načrtovan in voden, je pa vseeno sistematičen in pričakovan. Je del sistema in kulture, ki prihaja in je že tu. Sistematično posiljevanje nevernih žensk je del procesa islamizacije. /…/ Slovenke so danes v nevarnosti, ker država ne opravlja svojega dela. Vključno z ustavnim sodiščem.« Le-to je oktobra 2019 razveljavilo del zakona o tujcih, ki je bil sprejet leta 2017 in je organom pregona omogočal, da v izrednih razmerah na meji zavrnejo vsakogar, ki ne izpolnjuje pogojev za vstop. Golobova vlada, ki je migrantom na široko odprla vrata z odstranjevanjem ograje na naši južni meji, tako dopušča, da migranti zlorabljajo institut pravice do azila. Hkrati naši obmejni organi premalo intenzivno vračajo migrante v države na balkanski migrantski poti,  kjer so ti že zaprosili za azil.\n\nPoslanska skupina SDS je zato v petek vložila zahtevo za sklic izredne seje državnega zbora, na kateri bodo poslanci obravnavali »Predlog priporočila Vladi Republike Slovenije za ustavitev nezakonitih migracij, učinkovitejše ukrepe za zaščito meja Republike Slovenije, krepitev varnosti državljank in državljanov Republike Slovenije ter njihovega premoženja«. Nezakonito prehajanje schengenske meje je namreč največji varnostni izziv za Slovenijo pa tudi za druge države članice Evropske unije (EU), zato bi morala vlada sprejeti učinkovite ukrepe, da prepreči nezakonito prehajanje meje. Iz poročil policije namreč izhaja, da se število nezakonitih prehodov državne meje drastično povečuje. Od 1. januarja do 30. septembra letos je slovenska policija zaznala 44.751 nezakonitih vstopov v Slovenijo, v istem obdobju 2022 pa 18.433 nezakonitih vstopov. Najpogosteje so bili obravnavani državljani Afganistana, Maroka in Pakistana. Kot izhaja iz policijskih poročil, se posledično povečuje število »kaznivih dejanj zoper premoženje in telo ter spolno nedotakljivost«.\n\nSkratka, nemudoma je treba sprejeti odločne ukrepe za zajezitev nezakonitih migracij. A od nesposobne Golobove vlade je to težko pričakovati. Edina rešitev so tako predčasne volitve …\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 0, "end": 68}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 130, "end": 277}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 168, "end": 176}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 200, "end": 210}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 213, "end": 220}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 225, "end": 233}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 256, "end": 277}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 319, "end": 428}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 353, "end": 428}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 411, "end": 428}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 453, "end": 528}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1485, "end": 1496}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1514, "end": 1564}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1772, "end": 1891}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2060, "end": 2138}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2689, "end": 2823}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2866, "end": 2887}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2890, "end": 2908}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3065, "end": 3091}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3844, "end": 3899}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3957, "end": 4071}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4074, "end": 4125}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4129, "end": 4192}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4195, "end": 4231}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4281, "end": 4297}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4310, "end": 4325}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4328, "end": 4497}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4364, "end": 4388}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4502, "end": 4533}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 4536, "end": 4618}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4636, "end": 4704}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4706, "end": 4800}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4738, "end": 4744}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4748, "end": 4763}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4802, "end": 4887}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4830, "end": 4887}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5020, "end": 5032}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5061, "end": 5185}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5190, "end": 5287}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 5290, "end": 5429}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 5344, "end": 5429}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 5344, "end": 5429}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 5432, "end": 5463}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 5557, "end": 5605}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5713, "end": 5727}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 5730, "end": 5833}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 5762, "end": 5778}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 5793, "end": 5808}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5886, "end": 5983}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5987, "end": 5996}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 6011, "end": 6043}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 6131, "end": 6224}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 6227, "end": 6263}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 6266, "end": 6287}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 6290, "end": 6332}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6338, "end": 6402}], "article_id": "4424", "lang": "sl", "text": "Priseljenci nas bodo zamenjali le, če bomo na lastno kulturo pozabili\n\nTematika človeških migracij je eno izmed področij, kjer je tiste, ki jim politično nasprotujejo, ekstremno enostavno opisati kot nazadnjaške, nestrpne in homofobne ter tako pridobivati poceni politične točke. In seveda tudi obratno, mogoče je tudi enostavno zaslužiti z opisovanjem migrantov kot nevarnosti, ki se ji je treba zoperstaviti, preden bo prepozno ... \n\nKot tako pogosto gre za dva ekstrema, ki k reševanju dejanskega problema ne prispevata veliko. Problem je namreč večplasten, dolgotrajen, in nič ne kaže, da bo kaj kmalu izginil. \n\nČloveške migracije so se dogajale skozi celotno zgodovino. Skoraj noben narod oziroma skupnost ni izvirno “avtohton” na svojem območju, vsaj če gledamo dovolj dolgo nazaj. S trebuhom za kruhom človeštvo že celotno zgodovino išče bolj zelene travnike onkraj gora in morja. S tega vidika migrantov nikakor ne moremo kriviti zaradi iskanja boljšega življenja. \n\nMultikulturalizem je ponekod logičen, ponekod ne \n\nNarodi nekaterih držav, predvsem anglosaških, kot so ZDA, Kanada, Avstralija in Nova Zelandija, so že po definiciji večkulturni. To temelji predvsem na njihovi zgodovini, saj so nastali kot kolonije svetovnega imperija, ki jih je bilo treba poseliti ter oblikovati v nove, delujoče skupnosti, s skupnimi cilji in vrednotami. S tega vidika vrednote multikulturalizma v omenjenih narodih niso presenetljive. \n\nVendar pa takšno dojemanje ni najbolj posrečeno v starem svetu, kot je Evropa. Tu smo si kontinent uničili v dveh svetovnih vojnah, katerih glavna posledica je bilo oblikovanje nacionalnih držav. Torej držav, ki temeljijo na specifični naciji. Multikulturni smo morda bili v srednjem veku, ko koncept narodne pripadnosti še ni obstajal. S tega vidika se brisanje mej in vabljenje priseljencev iz raznoraznih kultur v Evropo najverjetneje ne bo dobro končalo. \n\nIntegracija ali asimilacija? \n\nKot rečeno, priseljevanje samo po sebi ni problematično. S spajanjem različnih kultur lahko pridobita obe. Vendar sta za to pomembni bistveni sestavini, ki pa ju dandanes na Zahodu ne opazimo ali omenjamo pogosto. Gre namreč za integracijo in asimilacijo.  \n\nAsimilacija je na splošno opredeljena kot poskus etničnih manjšin, da prevzamejo navade in tradicije večinske skupnosti, tako da postanejo podobne večinski kulturi. Medtem je integracija običajno opredeljena kot vključevanje posameznikov iz različnih skupin v družbo kot enakovrednih. \n\nV vsakem primeru, ob delujočih procesih integriranja in asimiliranja priseljenci ne predstavljajo večjih težav. S časom postanejo bistven, neločljiv del celote. A to ni nekaj, kar bi danes lahko opazili na Zahodu. \n\nMedtem ko so nas polna usta pojmov, kot so pravičnost, enakost, enakopravnost, enakovrednost ... v praksi takšnih rezultatov ni opaziti. Nasprotno, priseljence veliko pogosteje trpamo v nekakšna geta (ali pa se kar sami) ter jih obravnavamo drugače kot obstoječe državljane. Posledično se počutijo odtujene, nesprejete in zmedene. Naših vrednot ne posvojijo. In kako naj jih? Kaj sploh so naše vrednote? \n\nZnamenje velike, samozavestne civilizacije \n\nTu bi se naslonil na zgodovinskega prednika sodobnega Zahoda, rimsko cesarstvo. Šlo je za ogromno, večkulturno tvorbo, ki pa je večino svojega obstoja vzdržala enotna. Kako ji je to uspelo? \n\nRim je bil samozavestna družba z jasnimi vrednotami. Ideja Rima je bila pomembnejša od plemenske pripadnosti. Rimljan nisi postal z rojstvom v Rimu, temveč z načinom življenja. Rim je osvojena ozemlja in ljudstva aktivno romaniziral ter jih tako spreminjal v “Rimljane”. \n\nMnogo, predvsem poznejših rimskih cesarjev, ni bilo rojenih v Italiji. Izhajali so iz vseh koncev cesarstva. A to ni predstavljalo problemov, Rimljani niso bili nič manj kot Cezar. In ideja Rima se je ohranila še dolgo po padcu cesarstva. Bomo lahko v prihodnosti podobno rekli za sodobni Zahod? \n\nRavno tu je zame bistvo današnjega problema migracij. Na Zahodu kulturno nismo samozavestni; vase ne verjamemo; pogosto imamo vcepljeno slabo vest zaradi svoje zgodovine. Kaj je ideja Zahoda, razen materialnega blagostanja? \n\nNe verjamemo, da je naša civilizacija kakorkoli boljša od drugih. Svojih vrednot ne želimo povzdigovati. Sprejemanje priseljencev dojemamo kot nekakšno zgodovinsko kazen, pokoro za “storjeno gorje”. Takšno dojemanje izhaja predvsem iz levega političnega tabora, a tudi desni pogosto nima jasnih odgovorov in rešitev, razen preprečevanja oziroma omejevanja priseljevanja. \n\nA to jim v veliki meri ne uspeva, priseljenci pa medtem neprestano prihajajo in pri tem ne postajajo del naše kulture. Kako tudi naj? Če še sami ne vemo, kdo smo in kaj želimo, kako naj to vedo prišleki? Zakaj bi ti želeli postati del “zlobne”, “izkoriščevalske” civilizacije brez duhovne usmeritve? Kaj jim sploh nudimo, razen bolj udobnega življenja s številnimi pravicami in dodatki? \n\nKdo so Slovenci? \n\nIn čeprav je ta problem morda bolj izrazit v nekdanjih kolonialnih velesilah, se mu ne moremo izogniti niti v mali državici brez imperialne zgodovine. Večina priseljencev morda pri nas res ne želi ostati, a integrirati nismo sposobni niti že dalj prisotne kulture, kot so romi. \n\nTe obravnavamo drugače kot ostale državljane, potem pa se čudimo, zakaj so tudi rezultati drugačni. Kot je prepričan župan Novega mesta, Gregor Macedoni, če se otrok ne pošilja v osnovno šolo, se tudi ne spoštuje temeljnih družbenih vrednot. Razmere se celo aktivno slabšajo. Le kdo bi to lahko predvidel ...? \n\nTrdno sem prepričan, da naroda ne določa genski zapis. Določajo ga jezik, kultura, zgodovina. Ter vzgoja. Tako ni ovire, ki bi preprečevala romom, ali pa morda celo Sircem ali Nigerijcem, da postanejo Slovenci. Razen nas samih. Dokler jih bomo obravnavali kot vazo iz porcelana ali pa morda smrtonosni virus, ne bodo postali del nas.  \n\nNobene potrebe ni, da bi se priseljencev bali. Strah pred njihovo drugačnostjo po mojem prepričanju kaže na globoko nesamozavest v lastno kulturo. “Zamenjali” nas bodo le, če bomo na svojo kulturo pozabili. Seveda pa jim moramo pri vključitvi v družbo pomagati. Tako z zakoni kot z zgledom.\n\nVerujmo torej sami vase, v svojo kulturo, ter prišlekom nudimo zgled, kaj pomeni biti Slovenec. Obravnavajmo jih kot druge državljane. Zahtevajmo integracijo. Naučimo jih našega jezika, navad in vrednot.  \n\nSeveda pa moramo pri tem najprej vedeti, kaj te vrednote sploh so ... \n\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 25, "end": 62}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 85, "end": 120}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 127, "end": 147}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 334, "end": 427}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 927, "end": 942}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1274, "end": 1288}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1476, "end": 1484}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1616, "end": 1623}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1647, "end": 1690}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1696, "end": 1716}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1733, "end": 1806}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2166, "end": 2181}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 2186, "end": 2200}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2222, "end": 2259}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 2368, "end": 2383}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2387, "end": 2502}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2479, "end": 2502}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2586, "end": 2681}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2596, "end": 2681}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 2684, "end": 2749}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2690, "end": 2701}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2712, "end": 2720}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2814, "end": 2878}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2836, "end": 2842}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2892, "end": 3000}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 2892, "end": 3000}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2937, "end": 2955}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3003, "end": 3020}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 3095, "end": 3190}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3182, "end": 3190}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3222, "end": 3243}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3398, "end": 3492}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3431, "end": 3447}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3663, "end": 3671}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3937, "end": 3950}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3969, "end": 3986}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4014, "end": 4133}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4257, "end": 4287}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4273, "end": 4297}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4341, "end": 4377}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4341, "end": 4360}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 5036, "end": 5177}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5151, "end": 5177}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 5319, "end": 5384}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 5387, "end": 5436}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 5469, "end": 5583}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 5586, "end": 5615}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5637, "end": 5880}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 5883, "end": 6056}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5883, "end": 6056}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6386, "end": 6420}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6460, "end": 6484}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6572, "end": 6633}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 6636, "end": 6698}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 6834, "end": 7022}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6843, "end": 6854}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6914, "end": 7022}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 7025, "end": 7081}], "article_id": "4425", "lang": "sl", "text": "Vojna v Izraelu in Gazi: Vse daljši prsti novega mojstra prevar na Bližnjem vzhodu\n\n»Svetost življenja je bila iznakažena,« je grozovitost dogajanja v Izraelu za Radio Ognjišče opisal Nejc Krevs. Bližnji Vzhod je zajel nov konflikt, ki v svoji naravi presega okvirje vojne, saj o mrtvih, večinoma civilistih, spet govorimo v tisočih, že tako krhko ravnovesje, ki je bilo porok minimalni varnosti in miru v regiji, pa je porušeno. Vojaško je nadaljevanje zgodbe dokaj lahko predvideti, razlogi pa so, kot bomo videli, drugje, kot si to predstavlja večina zahodnega sveta. Zato naj tokrat ne razpravljamo o orožju in taktiki, pač pa o ozadju, ki ga je za razumevanje konflikta potrebno poznati.\n\nZahod po pričakovanjih enotno stoji za Izraelom: Američani krepijo pomorsko prisotnost v vzhodnem Sredozemlju, vodja diplomacije EU Josep Borrell je za danes sklical sestanek zunanjih ministrov povezave. Tu gre bolj za simboliko, za psa, ki ne grize. A bo vseeno spet uvedel kakšno sankcijo, ki v končni fazi ne bo imela kakšnega omembe vrednega učinka. Tudi ameriška vojaška prisotnost v regiji je zaenkrat še bolj simbolične narave in pričakovati je, da bo Izrael situacijo na bojišču najverjetneje obvladal sam.\n\nPred dnevi sta palestinski Hamas in libanonski Hezbolah izvedla bliskovit napad na večinoma civilne cilje v Izraelu. Operacijo sta organizaciji izvedli tako s palestinskega (Zahodni breg) kot tudi z libanonskega ozemlja, ISW pa poroča, da so se jima pridružili tudi militanti, ki niso neposredno povezani z njima ali pa z Iranom, katerega mednarodna srenja večinoma krivi za nastalo katastrofo. Ta je bila brutalna in je zopet razgalila tisto najnižje, kar človek lahko nosi v sebi: ob fanatičnem vzklikanju so se odvijali pokoli civilistov, posilstva in izmaličenja, razkazovanja in zažigi trupel.\n\nNa tem mestu pa nekaj o odnosu do dogajanja: edina slovenska stranka, ki je stopila v bran takšnemu ravnanju in ga ni obsodila, je Levica. To ravnanje naj bi bilo celo dober razlog, da Slovenija začne postopke za priznanje Palestine, menijo. Kot je dejal kolega Krevs, gledajo zgolj na celotno palestinsko vprašanje, ne pa na dejanja, ki so, upam si reči, obsojanja vredna in najbolj zavržna. Tu gre za nekakšen levičarski revolucionarni makiavelizem, kjer cilj posvečuje sredstva. Noben greh ni greh, če preko njega dosežemo svoje. (Ne)morala takšnih ljudi govori sama zase.\n\nPodobno zasledimo tudi pri levo nagnjenih komentatorjih, ki iščejo razloge za opravičevanje nečloveških grozodejstev. In takšne misli lahko prebiramo v vodilnih medijih. Prav je, da poznamo razloge, nikoli pa ni profesionalno s strokovnega vidika zganjati propagande za zločine proti človečnosti. Dragi »poznavalci«, tudi za holokavst bi lahko »naštevali razloge«. Pa jih ne, ker jih human človek ne more razumeti in podpreti. Ker so takšna dejanja zavržna in ne smejo imeti prostora med nami.\n\nSpomnimo, s takšnim pristopom, kot ga danes izkazujejo islamski džihadisti nad Izraelci, je pred leti strah trosil ISIS. Sunitski militanti so z orožjem, ki so ga ob umiku iz Iraka za seboj puščale ameriške sile, pobijali šiite, kristjane in ostale verske manjšine pa so v Siriji in Iraku tako rekoč iztrebili. Izrael, čeprav na papirju od islamskih ekstremistov najbolj osovražen, jo je tedaj čudežno odnesel brez praske, proti ISIS-u pa sta se tedaj aktivno bojevala Rusija in tudi Iran.\n\nSedaj je slika obrnjena: tarča so izraelski civilisti, za izvajalci nasilja pa stojijo elementi, tesno povezani z Iranom. A ameriška administracija je zaenkrat do uradnih obtožb Teherana zadržana: res, da so iranske oblasti pripravljale poulična slavja ob začetku nasilja, in res je, da so militante v preteklosti zalagale tako z materialno tehničnimi sredstvi kot tudi z vojaškim znanjem in obveščevalnimi podatki. Kljub temu pa vse več dejstev nakazuje, da ima največji interes za destabilizacijo Bližnjega Vzhoda Kitajska, in ne Iran, ki v zgodbi verjetno igra žrtveno jagnje Kitajcem.\nV igri nov mojster prevar\n\nNujno pa se je vprašati, kje so Izraelci zatajili, da je ob njihovih spoštovanja vrednih obveščevalnih sposobnostih do takega napada sploh prišlo. Po eni strani bi rekel, da gre za spanje na lovorikah, še bolj kot to pa velja omeniti dejstvo, da judovska država sedaj igra igro proti mojstrom prevar, Kitajcem, ki verjetno predstavljajo težji izziv od predvidljivo naivnih arabskih sosedov.\n\nIzrael je v preteklih letih širil diplomatski vpliv in normaliziral odnose z državami po celotnem Bližnjem Vzhodu in širšem muslimanskem svetu, enako pa je počela tudi Kitajska. Državi pripadata nasprotnima blokoma in interesi so neizbežno trčili, ob tem pa se je marsikdo znašel na dveh stolih. Na primer, hkrati, kot je Kitajska botrovala začetku pogovorov med Savdsko Arabijo in Iranom, so Savdijci skupaj z Izraelci tvorili protiiransko koalicijo. Če drugega ne, je Kitajski v interesu, da Savdijci prenehajo sodelovati z Izraelom, in za razdor zaroke je najpriročnejša tema, ki je za Izrael najbolj občutljiva, obenem pa poenoti muslimane vseh vrst: palestinsko vprašanje se je spet pokazalo kot najpriročnejši vzvod za eskalacijo konflikta, ki je v trenutku podrl geopolitično hišico iz kart.\n\nA nekako bo potrebno vzpostaviti novo stabilnost. Izraelske sile so do tega trenutka že osvobodile veliko večino prej zasedenega ozemlja, povračilni ukrepi že potekajo in pričakovati je, da bodo vse hujši. Že sedaj govorimo o desetinah tisočev ton streliva, odvrženega na sovražne cilje. Izraelska družba se bo v prihodnosti še bolj militarizirala, povečali se bosta politična stabilnost ter kohezivnost. Takšne izkušnje ljudi povežejo. In utrdijo oblast.\nKitajci bi izčrpavali Zahod\n\nNa drugi strani je geopolitična slika vse bolj jasna: Kitajska se srednjeročno najbrž ne bo sama spustila v odkrit konflikt z Zahodom, temveč bo delovala preko proksijev, kot so Rusija, Iran in kopica afriških držav. Ustvarjanje ali izkoriščanje že obstoječih vojn naj bi po načrtu, kot ga trenutno izvajajo Kitajci, Zahod iztrošilo, poleg tega pa naj bi mu odvzelo nadzor nad naravnimi viri. V konkretnem primeru, velik del zahodne proizvodnje orožja konča v Ukrajini, z novim žariščem na Bližnjem Vzhodu pa bi se povečala potreba ne le po proizvodnji sredstev, pač pa tudi po vojaški prisotnosti Zahoda v regiji. To denimo odvrača fokus ZDA od Pacifika, Evropa pa je že tako ali tako preobremenjena, ali bolje rečeno, nesposobna skrbeti za svojo varnost.\n\nHkrati Kitajska na drugi strani kot bogata prinašalka razvoja srednjeročno predstavlja ugodno partnerko nerazvitim državam. Če k temu prištejemo še kulturno pogojeno impotentnost Zahoda, da brani svoje interese, ne moremo videti drugega kot črno prihodnost svoje civilizacije.\n\nNekateri kot enega bistvenih mejnikov v boju za svetovno prevlado vidijo obvladovanje Bližnjega Vzhoda in v veliki meri imajo prav. Trenutna grozodejstva v Izraelu naj bi predstavljala morebitno odskočno točko v spopad večjega obsega, ki bi pogojno lahko muslimanski svet pod pokroviteljstvom Kitajske obrnil proti Zahodu. Sliši se neverjetno, a tudi neverjetne stvari se dogajajo.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 26, "end": 36}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 40, "end": 52}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 96, "end": 172}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 214, "end": 320}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 332, "end": 489}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 630, "end": 639}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 630, "end": 695}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 698, "end": 773}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 779, "end": 884}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 906, "end": 935}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1052, "end": 1090}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 1203, "end": 1299}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1570, "end": 1672}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1820, "end": 1861}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2016, "end": 2180}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2359, "end": 2451}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 2524, "end": 2549}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2552, "end": 2686}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2988, "end": 3009}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 3062, "end": 3170}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3397, "end": 3582}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 3437, "end": 3582}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3703, "end": 3813}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3729, "end": 3813}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3828, "end": 3856}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3956, "end": 3974}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4042, "end": 4062}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4065, "end": 4108}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4310, "end": 4336}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4375, "end": 4387}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 4453, "end": 4560}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4655, "end": 4675}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4850, "end": 4885}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4946, "end": 4982}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4985, "end": 5022}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5024, "end": 5065}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5429, "end": 5484}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5494, "end": 5562}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5527, "end": 5562}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5639, "end": 5661}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5891, "end": 5918}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 5954, "end": 5993}], "article_id": "4426", "lang": "sl", "text": "Dobro jutro in miren sen (Obujeno zlo v Sveti deželi)\n\n»Solidarnost z Izraelom je neomajna.«\n — Tanje Fajon ne omaje niti izraelsko množično pobijanje civilnega prebivalstva (MMC TVS, 8. 10. 23)\n\n»Napovedujemo, da bomo od zdaj na vsak napad na naše ljudi odgovorili z usmrtitvijo enega izmed sovražnikovih civilnih talcev.«\n— Hamas z znašanjem nad judovskim civilnim prebivalstvom v očeh mednarodne javnosti hudo relativizira večdesetletne krivice, trpljenje in žrtve palestinskega ljudstva (TVS, 9. 10. 2023)\n\n»… spremenili bomo Bližnji vzhod.

Prejšnji petek sem v Mladini objavil kritiko zunanje ministrice Tanje Fajon in sploh slovenske zunanje politike ob sprenevedanju glede priznanja Palestine. Na kratko, Fajonova je iz nezavezujočega položaja in udobnega sedeža evroposlanke pozvala slovensko politiko, naj že vendar prizna Palestino, saj so za to doseženi »kriteriji mednarodnega prava za priznanje«. To je bilo davnega leta 2014. No, danes kot zunanja ministrica vlade, v kateri daje poudarek zunanji politiki in prevzema zanjo vso moralno odgovornost, o priznanju Palestine striktno molči … In samo dan, pravzaprav nekaj ur po objavi (v soboto zjutraj) je izbruhnila v deželi lažnih obljub, obetov, cikličnih vojn, sprenevedanj, nenehnih spopadov in terorističnih dejanj nova kriza, ki bo – tako vse kaže – po razsežnosti in številu žrtev presegla vse dosedanje. Vsaj kar se civilnega prebivalstva tiče. Če odmislimo sporadične teroristične samomorilne akcije in povračilne ukrepe omejenega dometa, tokrat prvič civilno prebivalstvo – na eni in drugi strani! – ni kolateralna škoda, ampak osrednja tarča.\n\nEvropa je spet pokazala, da pravzaprav nima izdelane jasne mednarodnopolitične strategije; da v resnici ne ve, kaj hoče; da preveč ubrano sledi dirigentu zahodnega orkestra. Kar je škoda, kajti Evropa je z najbolj konkretno pomočjo obubožanemu in ogroženemu prebivalstvu Palestine nabirala moralni kapital za posredovanje in reševanje večnega spora. In spet so s prehitrimi in premalo domišljenimi izjavami čez noč porušili vse, kar so gradili. Od velikih evropskih igralcev do naših pešakov. Golob in Fajonova bi, to se pač opazi iz vesolja, potrebovala kratek kurz o nastajanju Izraela, o zgodovini odnosov in konfliktov s Palestinci vsaj na ravni povzetkov »google zgodovine«. Morda bi dojela, da zadnji napad Hamasa, kakorkoli nesprejemljiv po obliki in zavržen po metodi pač ne spada v kategorijo »z ničimer izzvanih napadov«. Ampak najdlje je šel Damir Črnčec, ki je zapisal, da bo odziv Izraela »upravičeno silovit, celovit in dolgotrajen«. Glede na to, da tega ne govori navijaški državljan XY, ampak državni sekretar na ministrstvu za obrambo, bi ga morali, zaradi takšne agitacije in apologije »upravičenosti« nasilja, nemudoma odstraniti z ministrstva. Ali pa razkriti, da je legitimiranje zaostrovanja konflikta uradno stališče vlade.\n\nTako kot bi morali na ravni EU nemudoma sprožiti postopke, da se zamenja komisar evropske komisije za soseščino in širitev Oliver Varhelyi, ki je prišel na dan z idejo, češ da je »obseg terorja in brutalnosti proti Izraelu in njegovim ljudem prelomnica in da zato običajnega sodelovanja (s Palestinci op. a.) več ne more biti«. Zato je po njegovem mnenju smiselno, da evropska komisija zaustavi celoten razvojni portfelj (691 milijonov!). Ob tem je še ugotavljal, da sta »spodbujanje sovraštva, nasilja in poveličevanje terorizma zastrupili misli premnogih«.\n\nDa, očitno si je z njima zastrupil misli tudi komisar Varhelyi.\n\nZ zadnjo eskalacijo bližnjevzhodnega konflikta lahko vsak, glede na svoje navijaške afinitete, najde dovolj argumentov in dokazov. Eni bodo prepoznali v Hamasu paradržavni terorizem, ki masakrira in ugrablja tudi mlade rejverje, med katerimi je bilo gotovo nadpovprečno število dialoško in mirovno naravnanih Izraelcev. Drugi bodo dobili v srhljivih podobah mater, ki izpod ruševin vlečejo mrtve in pohabljene otroke, dokaze za izraelski državni terorizem. Oboji bodo imeli prav. Vendar pa te krvave podobe niso vzroki, ampak posledica. A kakorkoli je grozno in obsežno, se resnici na ljubo ne dogaja nič, česar v desetletjih vojn in konfliktov na Bližnjem vzhodu ne bi že videli. Največja žrtev tega konflikta bo spet palestinsko ljudstvo. Pričakovati, da bo Hamas zaradi iracionalne surovosti izgubil visoko podporo med prebivalstvom, je utvara. Kajti Palestinci te vojne (več) ne morejo izgubiti, ker so že v izhodišču, vse od leta 1947/48, poraženci in prevarani. Islamistični in militaristični Hamas se je zredil na nedoslednem odnosu mednarodne skupnosti do sekulariziranega in dialoškega Fataha. Ultrakonservativna Netanjahujeva vlada je hotela in potrebovala vojno in konflikt. In Hamas ju je lahko zagotovil. Vsi, v Izraelu in tudi v mednarodni skupnosti (s Slovenijo vred), ki v teh dneh in nasploh podpirajo silovite reakcije, si ustvarjajo iluzijo, da se bodo otroci in mladostniki, ki telesno ali duševno pohabljeni lezejo izpod svežih ruševin naselij Gaze, postopoma razvili v glasnike miru, sočutja in dialoga.\n\nMednarodna skupnost je v reševanju »zla v Sveti deželi« popolnoma odpovedala. Zlasti z zapiranjem oči pred izraelskim nenehnim kršenjem mednarodnega prava: prisvajanjem ozemelj, sistematično gradnjo naselij na zasedenih ozemljih, neselektivnim znašanjem nad civilnim prebivalstvom v povračilnih »akcijah«, rušenjem domov svojcev domnevnih teroristov, pa z uvajanjem cest in obzidij apartheida, kot jih imenujejo … No, iz ust zahodnih diplomatov, pa tudi Tanje Fajon, besedne zveze »izraelski državni terorizem« ne boste slišali.\n\nP.

Saj res, a med Ukrajino in Rusijo še divja vojna? \n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 15, "end": 30}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 33, "end": 80}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 124, "end": 197}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 163, "end": 197}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 214, "end": 431}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 403, "end": 431}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 533, "end": 557}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 735, "end": 741}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 932, "end": 981}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 932, "end": 981}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 983, "end": 1012}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 1052, "end": 1116}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1089, "end": 1094}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1158, "end": 1220}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1332, "end": 1528}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1332, "end": 1483}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1419, "end": 1435}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 1594, "end": 1633}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1716, "end": 1724}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1771, "end": 1943}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1771, "end": 1837}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1961, "end": 2008}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2039, "end": 2193}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2242, "end": 2276}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2242, "end": 2316}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2305, "end": 2316}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2586, "end": 2685}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2595, "end": 2603}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2688, "end": 2740}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 3182, "end": 3196}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3410, "end": 3417}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3700, "end": 3732}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3814, "end": 3821}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 3824, "end": 3882}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3888, "end": 3894}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 4154, "end": 4202}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4182, "end": 4188}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 4205, "end": 4283}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4585, "end": 4628}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4609, "end": 4618}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 4632, "end": 4720}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 4723, "end": 4747}, {"tag": "Red_Herring", "start": 4814, "end": 4855}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 5224, "end": 5264}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 5268, "end": 5282}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 5284, "end": 5332}], "article_id": "4427", "lang": "sl", "text": "AstraZeneca je podivjan tramvaj\n\nCepiti se ali ne cepiti se, to je zdaj vprašanje\n\nNaj še moja malenkost pristavi lonček k procepilskim in proticepilskim debatam, zaradi katerih bo Facebook pregorel, Bill Gates pa si bo populil lase, ker ne bo mogel prek čipa, vstavljenega z injekcijsko iglo, prisluškovati intimnim mislim Johance Podlogar iz Spodnje Rupe pri Malem Potoku, po domače Hribovčeve mamke, gorečne nasprotnice cepljenja.\n\nZa začetek postulirajmo (sic, postulirajmo, kajti kmalu bomo zašli na močvirnata tla filozofije), da cepivo večinoma deluje, čeprav je to dvomljivo, kot kažejo okužbe v domovih za ostarele občane, katerih varovanci so pred boleznijo prejeli oba odmerka cepiva. Ampak kdo ve, morda vseh sto odstotkov starcev spada med tistih 27 odstotkov populacije, pri katerih cepivo ne prime.\n\nPravzaprav je že 27 odstotkov veliko. To pomeni, da bo za covidom kljub cepljenju morebiti zbolel vsak četrti občan. Ampak hej, bolje, da zboli eden kot štirje, kajne? Recimo torej, da cepivo deluje.\n\nNeželeni učinki pa so druga zgodba. Čutijo jih tako rekoč vsi, ki so jih pičili s cepivom AstraZenece. In tako se znajdemo na področju etike. Kajti nesporno je, da je odločitev za cepljenje moralno dejanje. Posameznik ima sicer s svojim zdravjem pravico početi, kar hoče, tudi tvegati, da bo staknil kaj nevšečnega, a če se ne bo cepil in če se v strahu pred neželenimi učinki ne bodo cepile tudi druge egoistične mimoze, nikoli ne bomo dosegli zaželene precepljenosti, s tem pa konca pandemije in vladnih ukrepov, ki nam že pošteno načenjajo živce – danes tako, jutri drugače, zaprtje ja, zaprtje ne, šola da, šola ne; presneto prožnega duha moraš biti, da lahko slediš vsem vsakodnevnim spremembam obsednega stanja, ki vlada v državi.\n\nTako smemo reči, da bi se moral posameznik cepiti tudi ali celo zlasti zaradi drugih in se skupnosti na ljubo sprijazniti z dnevom ali dvema zvišane telesne temperature ter klavrnega počutja. Že, ampak kaj, če je med neželenimi učinki cepljenja tudi smrt? Na tem mestu moram priznati, da Evropski agenciji za zdravila, ki ji naši mediji ljubeče po angleško pravijo kar EMA, ne verjamem niti besede, kadar zagotavlja, da je AstraZeneca varna. Kaj, hudiča, pa ste pričakovali, da bo rekla? Mednarodna birokratska organizacija farmacevtskemu podjetju ne izkljuje oči.\n\nŽe trditev agencije, da koristi cepiva odtehtajo tveganje, bi bilo mogoče razumeti tako, da je tveganje navzoče. Tu navajajoč agencijo povejmo, da lahko med milijonom cepljencev umre en človek. Ni veliko, kajne? Statistika je nekaj prekrasnega. Ampak kleč je v tem, da tisti nesrečnik ne bo umrl samo milijoninko, temveč stoodstotno, povsem in docela od glave do pet, to pa zanj in za njegove bližnje ne bo ravno prijetno, kljub zavesti, da mu je prekrasna statistika obetala znatno večje možnosti preživetja.\n\nČe se vprašamo, ali je dopustno žrtvovati enega, da bi bilo na varnem pred boleznijo 999.999 drugih ljudi, se znajdemo v enaki dilemi, kot jo ponujajo tisti obče znani filozofski miselni poskusi o zbezljanem tramvaju. Spomnimo se: tramvaj, nabito poln ljudi, neobvladano drvi naravnost proti prepadu, a nad tračnicami je most, na katerega ograji sedi neznansko debel človek. Če bi ga pahnili z ograje, da bi padel pred tramvaj, bi ta trčil obenj in se ustavil, vsi potniki v njem pa bi bili rešeni. Filozofi, ki se ubadajo z etiko, se že dolgo sprašujejo, ali je moralno umoriti debeluha, torej enega, da bi preživel ves tramvaj, torej veliko ljudi, pa se do zdaj še niso dokopali do enotnega odgovora. Tudi tisti Spockov: »Logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few,« je vžgal samo v Zvezdnih stezah. Pandemija pa ni film, ljudje. In logika ni vedno isto kot etika.\n\nZase nisem prepričana, da bi posegla v zgodbo o tramvaju tako, da bi usmrtila debeluha. Saj nisem bog, da bi smela odločati, kdo bo živel in kdo ne. Če debeluh noče pred tramvaj skočiti sam, ga jaz nimam pravice potiskati; niti ga nima pravice potisniti policaj, predstavnik državne oblasti. Vprašanje postane še bolj zavito, ko je po sredi cepljenje, saj je pri tem življenje, ki ga tvegaš, tvoje lastno. Kljub vsemu v imenu etike menim, da bom debeluh, ki skoči sam. Devetdeset odstotkov možnosti je, da se bom cepila, saj mi ni vseeno za soljudi. Vsekakor pa želim, da bi bila odločitev le moja.\n\nFilozofi iz knjige V kavarni eksistencialistov, ki sem jo prevajala pred leti, so mi zatrdili, da sem svobodna, zato se smem odločati zgolj po lastni vesti. Po lastni vesti, po svojem razumevanju etike, ne na ukaz oblasti ali pod pritiskom medijev, ki nam perejo možgane s hvalnicami cepljenju.\n\nZato se mi zdi nedopustno, da bi kakorkoli šikanirali tiste, ki se bodo cepljenju odrekli. Naj jim sodi njihova vest. Nedavna odločitev avstrijskih oblasti, da bodo smeli v kavarne (ah, avstrijske kavarne, kako jih pogrešam!) sedati le tisti, ki bodo na dan privlekli potrdilo o cepljenju, se mi zdi nedopustna, in če bomo kaj podobnega uvedli tudi pri nas, bom napisala kolumno. Sporno se mi zdi morebitno uvajanje cepilnih potnih listov in srh me spreleti ob zamisli, s katero je prišel na dan eden od izraelskih politikov: da bi necepljeni Izraelci morali na obleki nositi posebne oznake. Judje predlagajo uvedbo sramotilnih oznak – kam smo prišli? Sartre in de Beauvoireva pravita, da sem svobodna. To seveda še ne pomeni, da ne bom še mesece napenjala možganov in tehtala svoje koristi proti koristim skupnosti, da bi se odločila, ali se cepiti ali ne. Nihče ni nikoli rekel, da je svoboda lahka. Še vedno pa je boljša od oblastnih dekretov ali pritiskov neposredne in širše okolice.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 70, "end": 80}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 233, "end": 251}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 395, "end": 408}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 877, "end": 892}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 925, "end": 933}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1003, "end": 1014}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1315, "end": 1320}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 1351, "end": 1511}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 1513, "end": 1527}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1551, "end": 1577}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1614, "end": 1627}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1737, "end": 1757}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 1783, "end": 1798}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1801, "end": 1820}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2126, "end": 2161}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 2191, "end": 2208}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2758, "end": 2776}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 3371, "end": 3540}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 3560, "end": 3749}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3796, "end": 3802}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3909, "end": 3921}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 4043, "end": 4160}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4751, "end": 4775}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 4861, "end": 4991}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5107, "end": 5115}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 5118, "end": 5206}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 5209, "end": 5332}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 5702, "end": 5922}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 5926, "end": 6021}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 6082, "end": 6181}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 6184, "end": 6242}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 6245, "end": 6269}], "article_id": "4428", "lang": "sl", "text": "Ne vojne, mir nam dajte!\n\nZadnji dve leti verjetno sodita med najbolj krvavi leti v mednarodni skupnosti po koncu balkanskih vojn, ki so dodobra zatresle povojno Evropo.

V filmu tudi Chamberlain poudari, da je mir edino, za kar se je vredno boriti, in dodaja, da pri tem izhaja iz trpke izkušnje prve svetovne vojne.\n\nNjegovo dejanje seveda ni bičano samo z današnje perspektive. Že slavni Winston Churchill je Chamberlainu očital njegovo odločitev in poudaril: \"Izbirali ste med sramoto in vojno. Izbrali ste sramoto, a dobili boste vojno.\" In prav je imel. Chamberlain je ostal sramota mednarodnih odnosov, evropska celina je dobila vojno.\n\nTrpka izkušnja druge svetovne vojne in neuresničeni ideali\n\nŽelja po miru tako pred letom 1939 ni bila uresničena. Zato so očetje povojne Evrope skovali geslo o tem, da vojne nikoli več. Pa so bili neuspešni.\n\nRes se vojna do konca hladne vojne fizično ni bíla na svetovnih tleh, a dejstvo ostaja, da je bilo v tem času tudi v Evropi kar nekaj para-vojn, ki jih lahko imenujemo tudi državni udari ali vdori/invazije (ne pozabimo na Madžarsko leta 1956 in Češko leta 1968). V vseh teh procesih so bila izgubljena številna nedolžna človeška življenja.\n\nKljub temu se je v Evropi \"nikoli več vojne\" udejanjalo. A to je veljalo za Evropo. Kaj pa drugi deli sveta? Se spomnimo Koreje? Izraelsko-arabskih vojn in Vietnama? Afganistana ter Iransko-iraške vojne? Kuvajta … in še česa?\n\nMorda nas je to prizadelo manj, ker se ni dogajalo pred domačim pragom, a tudi v teh vojnah so umirali ljudje.\n\nManj orožja bo Balkanu dalo več miru\n\nIn zgodila so se 90. leta, hladne vojne je bilo konec, Sovjetska zveza je (z izjemo enega primera) razpadla na miren način, Jugoslavija žal ne.\n\nV tistih dneh, ko smo najbolj potrebovali orožje za lastno obrambo, so zahodni čamberlejni hodili naokoli in govorili, da potrebuje Jugoslavija manj in ne več orožja. Manj orožja bo namreč ustvarilo mir. A ga ni.\n\nNa območju nekdanje Jugoslavije so bila izgubljena številna življenja, uničene številne usode, razdrti številni zakoni, mrtvi, ranjeni … a miru, resnega, ta regija nima še 30 let pozneje.\n\nUkrajina, Izrael in Gaza\n\nV Evropi se je pred letom dni, ob ruski agresiji na Ukrajino, postavilo vprašanje, ali naj se žrtvuje del ukrajinskega ozemlja za to, da dobimo mir. Skratka neke vrste monopol, ko brez težav predaš nekaj, kar te ne \"žuli\".\n\nIn prišlo je do delitve duhov: eni so zagovarjali trditev, da bi prepustitev ukrajinskih ozemelj Rusiji zagotovila hiter mir (med njimi je bil tudi dolgoletni ameriški državni sekretar Henry Kissinger), drugi so trdili, da bi to po čamberlajnsko vodilo do vse širših teženj Ruske federacije, da vzpostavi ruski mir, ki z mirom, kot ga razumemo v Evropi in smo mu Slovenci zavezani z ustavo, nima nujno povezave.\n\nDanes, ko se z ekranov vsakodnevno vsipajo grozote dogodkov v Gazi in Izraelu (Ukrajina se je z naših ekranov skorajda umaknila, čeprav tam še vedno poteka krvava vojna!), se ponovno sprašujemo enako – kako zagotoviti mir v regiji, ki se že desetletja ne izvije iz bojnih spopadov.\n\nGre za desetletja uničenih življenj, pomanjkanja prihodnosti, dostojnega življenja, pravice do sožitja med soljudmi in narodi.\n\nV teh desetletjih je zaradi pomanjkanja prihodnosti v tej regiji odšlo v svet kar nekaj ljudi, ki se ne bodo nikoli vrnili na domačo grudo. Nekaj jih je izgubilo svoje bližnje, drugi so izgubili svoje življenje, nekateri so izgubili svoje otroke, drugi starše, stare starše … Skratka … vse to so bile in so tragične usode.\n\nUsode tistih, ki jim morda ni bilo dopuščeno, da bi v miru in svobodno gledali sončne žarke nad jeruzalemskim templjem, ali usode tistih, ki teh žarkov žal ne bodo nikoli več mogli videti.\n\nMir in Slovenija\n\nKljučno vprašanje po vsem povedanem je, kaj mora v tej nori mednarodni skupnosti narediti Slovenija. Odgovor na to ni enostaven, a ga bom vseeno poskusil nakazati.\n\nUstava leta 1991 pravi, da Slovenija \"pri zagotavljanju varnosti izhaja predvsem iz mirovne politike ter kulture miru in nenasilja\". Toda ali to pomeni, da se moramo odpovedati vojski, kar včasih pozivajo določeni posamezniki v slovenski družbi? Bogvaruj!\n\nVojska je eden od temeljnih konstitutivnih elementov države, zato je že prav, da jo imamo. Sočasno pa moramo vedeti, da je v modernih časih naloga vojske poleg obrambe države tudi obramba svetovnega miru in varnosti. No, ne samo vojske. To je naloga tudi (ali predvsem) politike.\n\nDa bomo odgovorni za lastno in tudi za širšo, mednarodno varnost, smo se zavezali tudi z vstopom v Evropsko unijo in zvezo Nato leta 2004. Zatorej je naša naloga, da tudi znotraj teh dveh integracij skrbimo za ustvarjanje in krepitev miru ter politiko miru in nenasilja.\n\nA da bi vse to lahko naredili, potrebujemo najprej zavedanje, da smo s svojo samostojnostjo in mednarodnim priznanjem dobili v mednarodni skupnosti ne samo pravice, ampak tudi dolžnosti oziroma, kot rad sam poudarim študentom – več dolžnosti kot pravic.\n\nZato je čas, da resno premislimo, ali smo za ohranjanje politike miru in mir sam naredili dovolj. Naj torej začne vsak sam pri sebi z izpraševanjem vesti … Iskanje miru in borba zanj nista stvar politike, ampak stvar nas, naših življenj in naše prihodnosti. Seveda, če želimo, da bi naši otroci živeli v boljšem svetu. Saj si to želimo, mar ne?\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1, "end": 11}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 16, "end": 24}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 87, "end": 134}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 137, "end": 228}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 141, "end": 149}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 231, "end": 399}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 277, "end": 331}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 423, "end": 515}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 434, "end": 443}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 724, "end": 744}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 749, "end": 914}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 858, "end": 914}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1053, "end": 1073}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 1083, "end": 1240}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2199, "end": 2473}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2477, "end": 2554}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2619, "end": 2683}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2837, "end": 3243}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2837, "end": 2972}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 4286, "end": 4361}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 4364, "end": 4595}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 4598, "end": 4825}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 5026, "end": 5134}], "article_id": "4429", "lang": "sl", "text": "\nCisseksizem ni feminizem\n\nDiskurze o feminizmih v današnjih časih srečujemo marsikje, kar nikakor ni le zaželeno, temveč tudi potrebno, saj feminizmi poudarjajo in ponazarjajo neenakosti v razmerjih moči med družbenimi skupinami. (Pre)pogosto pa te ponazoritve in ubeseditve, ki sicer temeljijo na vrednotah družbene enakopravnosti, prispevajo k izključevanju nekaterih identitet in družbenih skupin. Povedano natančneje, (pre)mnogo feminizmov je prežetih z biološkim determinizmom in zato s cisseksističnimi izrazi (npr. biološka ženska/moški, enačenje oseb z genitalijami; ženska je maternica, izključevanje transspolnih žensk iz feminističnih diskurzov na osnovi predpostavk o njihovih genitalijah itd.). Naj razložim.\n\nBiološki determinizem je skupek postavk in prepričanj, da imajo elementi telesnosti hieararhično večvreden, skoraj dogmatski položaj, ki ga ni mogoče prespraševati, saj gre vendarle za naravo. Anatomija, kromosomi, genotipi itd. so videni kot determinante identifikacij in vedenja ljudi, vse v okviru binarnega spolnega sistema. Biološki deterministi trdijo, da spolna identiteta osebe izhaja izključno iz njene/njegove telesnosti; telo je tisto, ki določa spolno identiteto in narekuje družbeno primerne spolne vloge. Mnogo oseb dejansko čuti, da se njihova spolna identiteta ter prevzete spolne vloge skladajo z družbenimi pričakovanji in normami glede tega, katera telesa naj bi imela katere identitete. Te osebe so cisspolne; njihova spolna identiteta se ujema z družbenimi pričakovanji o spolu, ki jim je bil pripisan ob rojstvu, same pa zaradi tega ujemanja ne doživljajo nobenih frustracij ali disforije. V nasprotju s cisspolnimi osebami pa transspolne na osnovi spola, ki jim je bil pripisan ob rojstvu, in družbenih norm, ki izhajajo iz tega spola, doživljajo neujemanje in disforijo med svojo spolno identiteto in družbenimi pričakovanji glede njihove spolne identitete in spolnih vlog, ki jih prevzemajo. Biološki deterministi torej zagovarjajo, da sta spol, ki je osebi pripisan ob rojstvu, in njena/njegova spolna identiteta neločljiva in medsebojno odvisna. Družbeni konstruktivisti/-ke, poststrukturalisti/-ke in/ali transfeministke/-i se s tem ne strinjamo. Transfeminizem zahteva, da s(m)o osebe prepoznane kot to, kar smo, brez vprašanj ali namigovanj na anatomijo, obliko ali videz našega telesa. Transfeminizem zahteva prepoznanje in upoštevanje vseh žensk. Tudi tistih s penisi. Transfeminizem zahteva feminizme brez cisseksizma.\n\nO temah dekonstrukcije skoraj ni mogoče razpravljati brez omembe Judith Butler, ki je v queer teorijo uvedla koncept performativnosti spolov. Butler trdi, da ne obstaja originalna ali naravna različica spola, temveč se vse verzije (re)producirajo znotraj diskurzov, normative pa tvorijo hegemonske družbene skupine, ki imajo največ družbene in politične moči. Za Butler je tako sama snovnost, materialnost telesa (kar cisnormativna družba razume in (si) predstavlja kot biološki spol) diskurzivna, kar trdi tudi o družbenih spolih, prav tako pa obe kategoriji označi za družbena konstrukta. Spoli (biološki in družbeni) so torej performativni; spoli in spolne identitete se (p)otrjujejo med dejanji, nobena identiteta pa ne obstaja onkraj diskurza in performativnosti. Prav med performativnostjo se tako tvorijo hegemonske družbene spolne norme, hkrati pa dejstvo, da ne obstaja nobena originalna verzija spola ali spolne identitete, nudi neskončne možnosti subverzivnosti do družbenih norm. In prav ta subverzivnost se manifestira tudi v obliki transspolnih identitet, ki niso nič bolj ali manj naravne kot cisspolne, imajo pa manj družbene moči, saj niso večinske in zato tudi ne normativne. Pozicioniranje v cisspolnih privilegijih in neenakovredno razporejena družbena moč v razmerju s transspolnimi osebami se izraža v raznih oblikah diskiminacije, med njimi tudi v cisseksizmu.\n\nCisseksizem je seksizem, zasnovan na biološkem determinizmu. Norma cisseksizma je cisspolnost – binarna delitev ljudi na moške in ženske na osnovi ob rojstvu določenega spola. Cisseksizem zato izključuje vse transspolne osebe, ne glede na to, kje vzdolž ali zunaj trans spektra se identificirajo, saj predpostavlja, da osebna spolna identiteta izhaja iz človekove telesnosti, kar pa ne drži za transspolne (in druge) osebe. Opozorila, da cisseksizem nima mesta v feminizmih, so zato osrednjega pomena; feminizem, ki daje več družbene moči nekaterim osebam (cisspolnim) kot drugim (transspolnim), namreč ni v skladu z osnovnimi vrednotami in etičnimi postavkami feminizma, ki (naj bi) se zavzema(l) za enakovrednost in legitimnost vseh. Raje kot biti cisseksistični, naj vsi sodobni feminizmi splošno razširjeno in sprejeto dejstvo, da so spoli in spolne identitete družbeni konstrukti, aplicirajo pri prevpraševanju vseh esencializmov, tudi biološkega determinizma. Večina feminizmov je namreč zasnovana na tezi, da je družbeni spol družbeni konstrukt, iz te postavke pa izhajajo feministični argumenti proti patriarhatu in mizoginiji. Transfeminizem pa opozarja, da (naj) bi bil v skladu s feminističnimi držami tudi biološki spol množično prepoznan kot družbeni konstrukt, kar služi kot osnova za boje s transmizoginijo. Najbrž želimo vse/vsi živeti v družbi, kjer so vse osebe, njihove spolne identitete in spolni izrazi prepoznani kot legitimni, brez diskriminatornih in izključujočih poskusov legitimiranja oseb na podlagi njihovih teles.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 26, "end": 42}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 56, "end": 136}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 59, "end": 63}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 154, "end": 437}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 157, "end": 172}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 470, "end": 530}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 533, "end": 726}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 769, "end": 829}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 832, "end": 991}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 995, "end": 1014}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 995, "end": 1065}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1033, "end": 1052}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1135, "end": 1203}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 1206, "end": 1297}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1308, "end": 1356}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1551, "end": 1562}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1665, "end": 1715}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 1696, "end": 1715}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1733, "end": 1906}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1845, "end": 1860}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 1910, "end": 2027}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2029, "end": 2397}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 2400, "end": 2434}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2590, "end": 2598}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2590, "end": 2928}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2600, "end": 2883}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2943, "end": 2948}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2950, "end": 3080}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2957, "end": 2961}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2976, "end": 2983}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3071, "end": 3080}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 3082, "end": 3521}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3092, "end": 3096}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3150, "end": 3164}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3174, "end": 3178}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3401, "end": 3405}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3418, "end": 3521}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 3700, "end": 3773}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 4241, "end": 4329}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4347, "end": 4630}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4350, "end": 4365}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4633, "end": 4735}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4750, "end": 4754}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 4803, "end": 4858}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 4861, "end": 5080}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 5083, "end": 5190}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5573, "end": 5577}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5653, "end": 5722}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5661, "end": 5665}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5758, "end": 5832}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5761, "end": 5776}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5783, "end": 5803}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5813, "end": 5832}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5849, "end": 5926}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5849, "end": 5853}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5986, "end": 6072}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5992, "end": 5996}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 6029, "end": 6105}], "article_id": "443", "lang": "sl", "text": "Konec vojne v 24 urah ali totalno uničenje?\n\nZdi se, da si Zahod prevečkrat postavlja vprašanje, ali se mir finančno in politično izplača.\n\nVidimo pa, da se zahodni politiki raje odločijo za obisk Izraela, pogovor in poziv za kratko prekinitev bombardiranja civilistov, pri tem, da ob vsaki priložnosti poudarjajo, da ima Izrael pravico, da se brani in da ga v tem popolnoma in neomajno podpirajo, financirajo in nekateri tudi oborožujejo. FOTO: Alaa Al Sukhni/Reuters\n\nVztrajno kršenje človekovih pravic prej ali slej vodi v vojno. Če politiki kršenje človekovih pravic sicer obsojajo, dejansko pa ga pasivno dopuščajo, bo nezadovoljstvo žrtev naraščalo, njihov odziv pa bo postajal vse bolj radikaliziran in verjetno oborožen. Napetost se povečuje in izbruhne vojna. Sledi opustošenje, žrtve in begunci, ki se odpravijo proti EU. Vsak dan je na mejah EU na tisoče novih beguncev iz Afganistana, Iraka, Sirije, Libije, Ukrajine pa še od kod, kjer se je Zahod vojskoval in prispeval k rušenju.\n\nBegunci in terorizem spodbujata vzpon skrajnih desničarjev v državah EU. To postaja grožnja demokraciji in zahodnim vrednotam. Možno je, da nekatere države v takem scenariju vidijo nove priložnosti in zaslužek. A izguba za ljudi je neizmerna in nepopravljiva, v določenih primerih celo na globalni ravni.\n\nIzrael je desetletja kršil človekove pravice Palestincev. Svet ZN za človekove pravice je obsodil Izrael v več kot 45 resolucijah in Izrael je celo kršil 28 resolucij Varnostnega sveta ZN, ki so pravno zavezujoče. To si lahko privošči, ker ga ščiti »veliki brat«, čeprav deklarira »pravičnost«. Zato društvo Amnesty International govori o izraelskih uradnikih, ki so zagrešili zločin apartheida po mednarodnem pravu. Navajajo, kako Izrael sistematično dehumanizira Palestince, jih diskriminira, kako je zaprl Gazo tako, da ta velja za največji zapor na prostem, kjer prebiva skoraj dva milijona Palestincev.\n\nAli se tako okupiran narod sme braniti? Ali se sme braniti tudi z orožjem? Ali je upor proti okupatorju res terorizem? Zahodni vodilni politiki niso hoteli videti tega kršenja Izraela. Prav tako niso hoteli videti kršenja človekovih pravic do drugih narodnosti v Ukrajini, na katere je opozarjal Urad za človekove pravice pri ZN (OHCHR), in neizpolnjevanja sporazuma iz Minska. Oba kršitelja so vodilni zahodni politiki hrabrili tako, da so jima namenjali izdatno finančno pomoč in orožje. Zato so sokrivi za izbruh obeh vojn.\n\nKaj narediti, ko vojna že izbruhne? Ko večja in vojaško močnejša država napade manjšo, si prisvoji dele napadene države in jih razglasi za svoje. S tem napadalec krši mednarodno pravo, saj spreminja mednarodno priznane meje, zaradi prisilnega preseljevanja civilnega prebivalstva krši deklaracijo o človekovih pravicah, krši načela o humanitarni pomoči, ne upošteva resolucij ZN, zločini nad civilnim prebivalstvom pa večkrat ostajajo nekaznovani, navaja zgodovinar in aktivist Vijay Prashad.\n\nKaj naredi Zahod? Ali bo Zahod zahteval, da okupator vrne zasedene teritorije? Ali bo vojaško pomagal napadenemu in sprejel sankcije proti napadalcu? Ali se bo Zahod odločal od primera do primera v skladu s stališčem »velikega brata«? Ali bo Zahod enako branil pravice napadenega, ko gre za Ukrajino in Palestino, ter obsojal okupatorja, ko gre za Rusijo in Izrael? Ali naj v obeh primerih napadalec plača škodo na objektih, infrastrukturi in odškodnino žrtvam? Ali se Zahod zaveda, da s svojo dvolično geopolitiko spodbuja nastanek in radikalizacijo ekstremističnih posameznikov in skupin? Kako bo zgodovina ocenila vse tiste zahodne politike, ki prihajajo v Izrael, da bi izrazili neomajno podporo vladi, ki izvaja genocid? Ali bo spet treba spreminjati zgodovino?\n\nS pravimi ukrepi s strani velesil bi se obe vojni že zdavnaj lahko končali. Kako bi se Izrael odzval, če bi mu ZDA in EU pa tudi njuni prijatelji postavili pogoj, da mora v roku 24 ur prekiniti bombardiranje Gaze in druge vojaške aktivnosti v Palestini, ker v nasprotnem primeru bo takoj ustavljena vsa finančna in vojaška pomoč Izraelu, zamrznjeni bodo vsi računi Izraela v zahodnih bankah, ustavljena bo vsa trgovina z Izraelom in Mednarodno kazensko sodišče (ICC) bo začelo postopek za nalog za aretacijo odgovornih izraelskih politikov? To bi bila odločitev politike za konec genocida v Gazi, ki bi v enem dnevu rešila problem.\n\nVidimo pa, da se zahodni politiki raje odločijo za obisk Izraela, pogovor in poziv za kratko prekinitev bombardiranja civilistov, pri tem, da ob vsaki priložnosti poudarjajo, da ima Izrael pravico, da se brani in da ga v tem popolnoma in neomajno podpirajo, financirajo in nekateri tudi oborožujejo. Pozive k miru označujejo za antisemitizem, tako kot so take pozive v Ukrajini označevali za rusofilstvo.\n\nKako pa bi Zahod lahko ravnal, če bi mu uspelo napade ustaviti? Spet smo pri zagotavljanju spoštovanja človekovih pravic. Izraelska politika, ki temelji na tem, da je Izrael država judov, torej le ene etnično-verske skupine, se mora spremeniti tako, da zagotovi enake pravice tudi drugim, skladno z načeli iz deklaracije o človekovih pravicah. Palestince je treba, kljub negativnim izkušnjam, prepričati, da ne smejo zanikati pravice do obstoja Izraela. Ali je mogoče pričakovati tako preobrazbo Izraela in Palestine?\n\nKo po drugi svetovni vojni zavezniške sile niso zaupale, na primer Nemčiji in Avstriji, so tam začasno prevzele vodenje civilnih, gospodarskih in pravnih struktur, skupaj s finančno pomočjo in prepovedjo oboroževanja. Ali ne bi podoben pristop lahko deloval v Izraelu in Palestini, a tokrat pod okriljem ZN, saj je Zahod zaradi pristranskosti tam izgubil kredibilnost?\n\nTo bi bila zmaga za vse. Ali ima Zahod dovolj moralne moči, da sproži vsaj kakšen korak k miru? Do zdaj tega ni bilo opaziti, saj so zahodni politiki bolj bobnali vojaški boben, kot pa spuščali goloba miru. Zdi se, da si Zahod prevečkrat postavlja vprašanje, ali se mir finančno in politično izplača. Zato ni težko predvideti nadaljnjih dogodkov? Kako dolgo si bo Zahod drznil uveljavljati to logiko, ki vodi v geopolitiko osamitve in terorizem? Morda pa tudi v totalno uničenje.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 22, "end": 78}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 305, "end": 406}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 338, "end": 406}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 677, "end": 689}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 808, "end": 847}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 877, "end": 887}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 977, "end": 987}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1424, "end": 1509}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1802, "end": 1826}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2010, "end": 2024}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2058, "end": 2125}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2085, "end": 2097}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2252, "end": 2275}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 2278, "end": 2505}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2297, "end": 2313}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3859, "end": 3875}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 4059, "end": 4129}], "article_id": "4430", "lang": "sl", "text": "Mir za vsako ceno ali koliko ukrajinske zemlje je vredno članstvo v zvezi NATO?\n\nGovorice o premirju in o možnem dokončnem miru med Ukrajino in Rusijo se širijo že od začetka vojne naprej. V tem času smo videli več mirovnih pobud oz. pisem s predlogi, pisanimi na kožo Rusiji, ki so bila spisana na mizah ostarelih in odvrženih politikov z znanimi predhodnimi stiki z ruskim predsednikom Vladimirjem Putinom. Ravno zato je bila izjava Stiana Jenssena, vodje kabineta generalnega sekretarja zavezništva NATO Jensa Stoltenberga, sprejeta kot veliko presenečenje, saj je Jenssen podprl idejo o premirju med Ukrajino in Rusijo, s katerim bi lahko Rusija obdržala del pridobljenega vojnega plena.\n\nJenssenova izjava je razburila javnosti zahodnih držav in hkrati resno zaskrbela Ukrajince, ki jih že dolgo skrbi, da jo bo Zahod na koncu pustil na cedilu.\n\nZemlja v zameno za mir in NATO dežnik\n\nMedtem ko se boji v jugovzhodni Ukrajini nadaljujejo, se je na Norveškem pojavila nova čudna ideja o miru. Po poročanju norveškega časopisa VG je Jenssen v javni razpravi o vstopu Ukrajine v zvezo NATO omenil možnost, s katero bi lahko z eno potezo dosegli sporazum o miru in članstvu Ukrajine v zavezništvu v zameno za ukrajinsko ozemlje, ki bi bilo predano v upravo Rusiji. Vodja kabineta Stoltenberga je sicer poudaril, da bi to lahko bila samo ena od možnosti, in pozneje dodal, da bi takšno odločitev sprejela lahko le Ukrajina, na koncu pa se je celo opravičil za svojo \"napako\", a škoda je bila takrat že storjena.\n\nIz pragmatičnega in politično kratkovidnega zornega kota bi takšen mir lahko pomenil nekakšen kompromis, saj bi Rusija z ohranitvijo zasedenih ozemelj na vzhodu Ukrajine lahko razglasila uspeh, Ukrajina pa bi v zameno dobila zagotovljeno varnost znotraj Severnoatlantskega zavezništva pod Natovim jedrskim dežnikom.\n\nUkrajinski odgovor\n\nUradni Kijev je po pričakovanjih takoj reagiral in poudaril, da bi takšen mir izdal Ukrajino in vse njene prebivalce, še posebej tiste, ki bi morali ostati pod ruskim škornjem. Poleg tega je opozorila, da bi takšen mir še vedno pustil lačnega volka pred vzhodnimi vrati Evrope. Čeprav bi del Zahoda videl takšen mir kot pozitiven kompromis, bi tako dosežen mir dolgoročno le nalil olje na ogenj ruskih imperialističnih ambicij. Ruski vrh in ruski ultranacionalisti bi v kompromisnem miru videli le svojo zmago in šibkost Zahoda in zveze NATO, kar bi jim brez dvoma le dalo spodbudo za načrtovanje nadaljnjih napadov na druge vzhodnoevropske sosednje države (npr. Estonija, Finska, Latvija in Litva ipd.)\n\nPo pričakovanjih je tudi Rusija uradno zavrnila Jenssenovo idejo o kompromisnem miru, ki bi po njenem mnenju krepila idejo, da je bil eden od razlogov za začetek vojne v Ukrajini preprečitev njenega vstopa v NATO. Rusija si hkrati želi doseči razkol med zahodnimi zaveznicami, čeprav se bolj racionalni del ruskega vrha zaveda, da bi vstop Ukrajine v NATO v primeru mirovnega dogovora lahko tudi okrepil zavezništvo. Po drugi strani pa so v ruskem vrhu tudi takšni, ki vidijo prihodnost za Rusijo le v totalni in dokončni zmagi nad Ukrajino brez mirovnega kompromisa. Drugače povedano, kompromisni mir ni všeč niti samemu Putinu.\n\nDolgoročne možnosti za dosego miru\n\nČeprav je vodstvo zveze NATO hitro popravilo Jenssenovo izjavo in se ponovno zavzelo za popolno pomoč Ukrajini \"dokler bo ta potrebna\", pa mnogi v tej izjavi vidijo začetek večjega skepticizma zahodnih vlad do dejanske vojaške zmage Ukrajine. Res je tudi, da se trenutna ukrajinska protiofenziva nadaljuje zelo počasi in samo posamezni uspehi kažejo na možnost resničnega ukrajinskega preboja. Zato ni čudno, da se nekaterim opazovalcem zdi, da se bo frontna linija le malo premaknila v smer Rusije. Tudi nekdanji francoski predsednik Nicolas Sarkozy je v intervjuju za francoski časopis Le Figaro izrazil podporo miru v korist Rusije.\n\nČrni oblaki dvoma se kažejo na obzorju ukrajinske vlade tudi zaradi prihajajočih ameriških predsedniških volitev, kjer bo vojna v Ukrajini spet burila duhove. Očitno smo na pomembni točki te vojne in enotna podpora zahodnega sveta Ukrajini je pomembna bolj kot kadar koli. \n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 0, "end": 33}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 0, "end": 13}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 15, "end": 33}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 82, "end": 241}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 123, "end": 142}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 159, "end": 180}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 278, "end": 376}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 278, "end": 301}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 304, "end": 414}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 418, "end": 674}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 418, "end": 674}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 460, "end": 493}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 496, "end": 500}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 503, "end": 510}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 518, "end": 539}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 550, "end": 564}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 607, "end": 652}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 677, "end": 719}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 677, "end": 719}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 722, "end": 821}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 751, "end": 757}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 762, "end": 770}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 813, "end": 821}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 830, "end": 1172}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 855, "end": 903}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1011, "end": 1019}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 1038, "end": 1057}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1128, "end": 1172}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1176, "end": 1253}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 1397, "end": 1531}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 1449, "end": 1531}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1622, "end": 1694}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 1697, "end": 1796}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1697, "end": 1745}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 1770, "end": 1796}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 1826, "end": 1955}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1886, "end": 1907}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 1959, "end": 2027}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2195, "end": 2216}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 2347, "end": 2459}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2675, "end": 2732}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 2696, "end": 2713}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2845, "end": 3089}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2953, "end": 3001}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3103, "end": 3232}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3178, "end": 3232}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 3263, "end": 3368}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3282, "end": 3298}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 3341, "end": 3368}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 3371, "end": 3418}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 3438, "end": 3502}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3452, "end": 3502}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3476, "end": 3485}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3490, "end": 3496}], "article_id": "4431", "lang": "sl", "text": "Brutalen naval ilegalnih migrantov na Slovenijo. Do sedaj za eno Celje z okolico\n\nSlovenija je že »dodobra« obremenjena in stroškovno  izčrpana od prisotnosti nezakonitih  migrantov, namestitvene zmogljivosti za »začasno« bivanje pa  prepolni.  V takšnih situacijah in glede na dezorientirano  politiko, v samih domovih, ki nimajo izdelanih kriterijev nadzora njihovega gibanja, se zgodi to kar najmanj  potrebujemo.\n\nVse več je situacij kjer se prenekateremu nezakonitemu in nezaželenemu gostu  utrga, poblazni, dobi hormonalno disfunkcijo,  ali da spolno zapopade kar mu pride pred oči, kar je zelo blizu posilstvu, nadlegovanju, uničevanje premoženja, javnega in zasebnega. Posledično temu kriminal  vseh vrst narašča. Že do sedaj se zvrstilo  več odurnih in nizkotnih ter skoraj da na javnih mestih izvršenih posilstev. To da organi v sestavi oziroma policija,   ki morala biti garant za našo varnost želijo prikrivati pred državljani, celo preimenujejo in kvalificirajo drugače, kot  so že  primer dejanja posilstva preimenovali v  »zadrževanje na tleh«, ne more skriti in prikriti nezmožnost kosanja   s to problematiko,  ki je ključna za občutek varnosti državljanov.\n\nDo konca  oktobra je bilo obravnavanih že kar 50.622 nezakonitih prehodov meje. Ob tem gre samo za migrante, ki so jih policisti dejansko prijeli. Med njimi je,  kot kaže,  največ Pakistancev, Afganistancev in Maročanov. Vsi iz držav kjer ni direktnih vojaških spopadov in so načelom varne države, posebej Maroko, kamor gredo ogromne množice naših turistov. Če vzamemo lansko leto, ko je slovensko državno mejo nezakonito prestopilo 24.662 oseb, hitro ugotovimo da  gre za  strm oziroma stoodstotni  porast  teh trendov. Omogočila jih je seveda omogoča Golobova politika, ki je dejansko postal moška izvedba Angele Merkel, vsaj glede tega vprašanja. Jasno,  največ je šlo mimo meje in vseh uresničenih dejanj  ilegalnega prestopanja na delih meje kjer so ostranili  panelno ograjo.\n\nDa je to res, priča statistika ilegalnih prehodov na območju PU Celje. Na  območju, ki ga pokrivajo  s strani PU Celje,  so obravnavali 270 oseb, ki so nedovoljeno vstopile na notranji meji. Za primerjavo, v lanskem letu je bilo zaradi nedovoljenih  prehodov  čez državno mejo, izmikanju  mejni kontroli in nedovoljenega vstopa na notranji meji v skupnem seštevku  obravnavanih 536 oseb. Na območju PU Celje, je odstranjeno samo pet odstotkov panelne ograje. Še en dokaz da ograja učinkuje in zadržuje.\n\nPo državljanstvu so  policisti  s Celjskega najpogosteje prestregli( ko so že bili na naši strani meje):  63 Afganistancev,  34 Pakistancev,  18  Rusov, 13 Maročanov, 11 Turkov, 19  Indijcev in 10  Šrilančanov.\n\nVsi z željo da gredo trebuhom za kruhom in ne zaradi vojne. Spet nepravilno dopuščanje in kasnejše spuščanje v državo ob izjavi da hočejo  azil ali mednarodno  zaščito.  In  minister za notranje zadeve Golobove vlade,  kot najvišje kotirajočega  kuharja v politični hierarhiji, domačinom, ki skozi okno si ne upajo pokukati ven, pravi, izognite se stikom in jih samo spustite naprej, za vsak primer  pa se zaklenite.\n\nAli je to načrtno ignoriranje lastne zakonodaje, nespoštovanje države kot takšne ali popolna politična in mentalna zakrnelost »odločevalcev«,  mi ni jasno in razumljivo. Če se ne bodo sami spravili k pameti, jih bo obravnaval narod oziroma volivci katerim so prinesli »upanje«. Izigrano upanje in zaupanje zna biti zelo boleče.  Za ljudi je že.

Ti ljudje prevažajo marsikoga in vidijo marsikaj in ker so pogosto klepetave sorte, so lahko mnogokrat navdih za zgodbo. Kot vsak drug kliše je tudi ta seveda hkrati obrabljen in romantiziran. Konkurenca med taksisti je dandanes tako velika, da pogovor redko zaide dlje od vremena oz. tega ali onega koncerta, ki se je ravnokar končal, zaradi česar ste na taksi sredi noči čakali debele tričetrt ure.\n\nTo seveda ne pomeni, da se s taksisti ne smete pogovarjati. Nasprotno, že osnovna vljudnost vam narekuje, da si s človekom, ki vas bo relativno hitro in udobno pripeljal na cilj, izmenjate vsaj nekaj besed. A verjetno boste boljši vpogled v družbo in lokalno okolje dobili med vožnjo z avtobusom.\n\nOd fužilnika do ruščine\n\nRedni uporabniki ljubljanskega potniškega prometa so gotovo zaznali mnogoštevilne jezike, ki se jih v zadnjem desetletju in pol sliši na mestnih zelencih. Daleč so časi, ko ste na busu slišali bolj ali manj zgolj slovenščino. Natančneje, zgolj ljubljanščino, medtem ko so se preostala slovenska narečja pojavila predvsem v času informativnih dni, brucovanj ter rednih tedenskih migracij s filofaksa na FDV, ker je imelo nekaj nesrečnikov študij novinarstva vpisan \"pod B\".\n\nDandanes lahko že na krajši vožnji z avtobusom – poleg vseprisotne angleščine – slišite plejado domačih narečij in tujih jezikov. Od štajerščine do kitajščine, od grosupeljščine do ruščine, od fužilnika do raznih variacij arabščine. In vse vmes. In ker skupaj z drugačnimi jeziki pridejo tudi drugačne kulture, bi bil nekdo, ki bi šel dandanes prvič po petnajstih letih spet na mestni ali katerikoli drugi avtobus, verjetno precej presenečen.\n\nZato gre po svoje razumeti šok in nejevero, ki sta očitno prežela Martina Nahtigala, ko je pred dnevi vstopil na medkrajevni avtobus proti Novi Gorici ter na njem zaznal – in nato posnel – več ljudi z rjavo barvo kože. Konec koncev, če se človek po državi ne vozi z avtobusom ali (pomislite!) vlakom, jutra in večere prebije, na primer, v zastoju med Brezovico in Vrhniko, pač ne more opaziti sprememb v etnični in kulturni sestavi potnikov v slovenskem omrežju javnega prevoza.\n\nKer je Nahtigal, sicer član Urbanijeve ekipe za prevzem RTV Slovenija, posnetek opremil z ustrezno zaskrbljenim pripisom o nenadzorovanih migracijah in vse skupaj objavil na omrežju X, nekoč bolj znanem kot Twitter, je seveda takoj nastal kraval.\n\nBledoličniki srečajo temnokožce\n\nPri tem je treba takoj dodati, da posnetek ni nepomemben. Med drugim namreč jasno pokaže, da tudi dandanes izvajalci medkrajevnih prevozov gladko prodajo več vozovnic, kolikor je sedežev na avtobusu. Posledično morajo nekateri potniki med vožnjo stati, kar pa je pri teh razdaljah in hitrostih lahko zelo nevarno. Da o nevzdržnih razmerah na avtobusu v poletni vročini sploh ne govorimo. Neki drugi uporabnik Twitterja je poleti poročal o ženski, ki se je v podobnih razmerah na avtobusu onesvestila.\n\nA bistvo ni v tem, kar je bilo na posnetku vidno. Nenazadnje, skupina ljudi, ki so vsi po vrsti plačali vozovnico in se v zameno za to v potu lastnega obraza cijazijo čez Rebrnice, pač ni kdo ve kako zanimiva. Bistveno je, kar je avtor posnetka z njegovo objavo domneval: da gre za avtobus, poln nelegalnih migrantov, ki samo čakajo na prebeg v Italijo.\n\nPri tem seveda ne gre zanikati dejstva, da so dandanes migracije, zakonite in nezakonite, izziv za številne države in družbe. Slovenija pri tem ni nobena izjema in vedno večje socialne razlike med razvitimi in manj razvitimi državami kažejo, da se stvari še dolgo ne bodo spremenile. Da o podnebnih spremembah kot sprožilcu migracij sploh ne govorimo.\n\nA sklepati o namenih ljudi zgolj na podlagi barve njihove kože, žalibog, precej zaudarja po rasizmu. Na ta način namreč naenkrat ni več nobene razlike med migrantom iz Afganistana, hotelskim delavcem s Filipinov ali skupino Indijcev na poletni avanturi, če naj vzamemo nekaj naključnih primerov. Ostane le še delitev na \"njih\" in \"nas\". Oziroma, kot bi verjetno dejali v nekih bolj naivnih in neobčutljivih časih, na temnokožce in bledoličnike. In \"ve se\", kdo sme sedeti na avtobusu. Vsaj v njegovem sprednjem delu.\n\nGojenje gneva (spet)\n\nPosnetek so seveda takoj pograbili tudi mediji v skrajno desni strankarski spregi in vse skupaj prignali do absurda. Niti mesec dni ni minilo, odkar smo točno na tem mestu pisali o gojenju gneva, in že imamo učbeniški primer tega fenomena.\n\nNamen posnetka namreč ni bilo poročanje o kakršnemkoli incidentu. Tega niti ni bilo, saj so potniki ves čas sedeli pri miru. Prav tako ni šlo za pozivanje k spremembi politik ali spremembi njihovega izvajanja. Šlo je enostavno za ustvarjanje gneva in odpiranje nove (čeprav v resnici precej stare) teme za kritiziranje oblasti.\n\nZ zadnjim seveda ne bi bilo nič narobe, če ne bi šlo za precej neroden manever v času tako opevane popoplavne politične enotnosti.\n\nKo sta premier Robert Golob in vodja največje opozicijske stranke Janez Janša zaradi poplav razglasila nacionalno enotnost, se je marsikomu v državi orosilo oko. Češ, kako lepo, da zna politika vsaj v najhujših trenutkih stopiti skupaj in pozabiti na trenutne razprtije.\n\nIn vendar so se skrbi, da bo poplavna politična enotnost trajala kaj dlje od parlamentarnih počitnic, izkazale za neutemeljene. Koalicija in opozicija sta bili enotni zgolj toliko časa, kolikor so se njuni pogledi na nujnost sanacije po poplavah bolj ali manj skladali. Toliko lažje, če je šlo za ukrepe, ki so bili ljudskim ušesom prijetni. Na primer, za dodatno obdavčitev bank kot enega od virov denarja za poplavno sanacijo.\nIskanje neenotnosti\n\nMnenja o tem, ali gre za primeren ukrep ali ne, so deljena. A hipna preobrazba Janeza Janše iz domnevnega zagovornika svobodne gospodarske pobude v zakrknjenega marksista, ki bi bančnim rentnikom pobral mastne dobičke, je bila izjemno zabavna. Toliko bolj, ker se je zgodila v živo, med skupnim nastopom Goloba in Janše na eni od zasebnih televizij. Mihi Kordišu se je najbrž kar smejalo.\n\nA kaj kmalu po tem dogodku se je ta tako opevana politična enotnost porazgubila neznano kam. Načeloma tudi s tem ni nič narobe. Različna mnenja in različni pogledi so namreč bistvo demokracije. Tako pozornim opazovalcem ni ušlo, da se je poetika politične enotnosti nanašala zgolj in samo na poplavno obnovo. Vsa druga področja so ostala legitimna polja političnega prerivanja.\n\nA ker je praktično celotna medijska in politična pozornost namenjena odpravi posledic poplav, je za nadaljevanje političnega boja takšno temo treba ustvariti.

To etapo konflikta na Bližnjem Vzhodu ste namreč izgubili.\n\nNedavno je bil med Izraelom in skrajnim terorističnim in militantskim gibanjem Hamas sprejet dogovor o premirju. Med prekinitvijo ognja naj bi Hamas izpustil nekaj izraelskih in tujih talcev, Izrael pa nekaj palestinskih zapornikov. Med tema dvema kategorijama je treba razlikovati: ko je Izrael odvzel svobodo zapornikom, je imel za to določeno pravno podlago. Ko je Hamas odvzel svobodo talcem, je bilo to barbarstvo z edinim motivom izsiljevati zakonito oblast s smrtjo nedolžnih ljudi.\n\nPo načrtu naj bi izmenjave potekale v serijah in obe strani jih kot dogovorjeno izvajata. Za vsakih deset izpuščenih talcev naj bi se premirje podaljšalo za en dan, hamasovci pa najprej izpuščajo osebe z neizraelskim ali z dvojnim državljanstvom, da si ne bi nakopali gneva tretjih držav. A vedeti moramo, da je razmerje števila izpuščenih približno 1 : 2 v korist Hamasa. Izvedba zamenjave je tudi pogoj za dovoljenje za prihod humanitarne pomoči na območje Gaze: Izrael je držal besedo in konvojem omogočil dostop. Ob tem je premier Netanjahu javnosti in družinam obljubil, da bodo na koncu osvobojeni vsi talci.\n\nMatematika intifade se zaenkrat ni izšla ...\n\nDo tukaj vse lepo in prav. A poglejmo v ozadje: zakaj je do premirja sploh prišlo? Ne sliši se več poziva h genocidu nad Židi »od reke do morja« in še pred nekaj tedni zmagoslavni in optimizma polni fanatični zanos brutalnih militantov in teroristov je uplahnil. Da je nekomu pošteno tekla voda v grlo, pa dokazuje dejstvo, da je premirje nastopilo v režiji Katarja kot mediatorja. Katar je sicer največji financer in podpornik Hamasa, ki na svojem ozemlju gosti tudi vodstvo slednjega z Ismailom Hanijo na čelu. Očitno se matematika nekomu ni izšla in šejki so izposlovali premirje vojne, ki so jo sami obilno pomagali zakuhati.\n\nPremirje se je moralo zgoditi. Kot sem že večkrat izpostavljal, spopadi niso v interesu neposredno vpletenih, torej Izraela in Palestincev, izkazalo pa se je, da v tej fazi niso niti v interesu zunanjih faktorjev, vsaj tistih v srednji vrsti ne, kot so denimo sosednje države in arabski financerji. Dogovor o premirju so pozdravile ZDA, Velika Britanija in Francija, na drugi strani pa tudi Rusija in Kitajska.\n\nZ nadaljevanjem konflikta bi izgubljala tako zahodni kot protizahodni blok. Zahodnjakom, predvsem Evropi, nista povšeči nestabilnost v regiji ter to, da se Izrael kot edina zares zahodna sila na Levantu z vojno izčrpava. Nasprotni strani pa se je projekt ustavil na terenu, saj se je izraelska vojaška uspešnost izkazala nad pričakovanji. Res je, da so izraelske sile utrpele določene izgube, a vedeti je treba, da se ne bojujejo več proti pouličnim nasilnikom bližnjevzhodnega tipa, ki grozijo s palicami, kamni ter sem in tja s kakšnim sumljivim nahrbtnikom. Gre za znatno bojno silo s sorazmerno sodobnim in učinkovitim orožjem, nenazadnje tudi z raketnimi sistemi in vrhunsko iransko obveščevalno podporo.\n\n... interes financerjev slabi\n\nPa vendarle, ob širši uporabi še neizkoriščenih sredstev bi bil Izrael zmožen učinkovitost na svojem interesnem območju še povečati. Ne govorim le o sistemih, ki jih Izrael že ima, temveč tudi o visokotehnoloških ameriških izdelkih, kot so vojaški brezpilotniki. Nekateri takšni sistemi so že dejavni na ukrajinskem bojišču in govori se, da so (nekateri pa še bodo) prispeli tudi v Izrael. Zaradi svoje preciznosti so kot nalašč za boj proti militantom in teroristom.\n\nNova intifada je torej zastala tudi zato, ker so financerji v danem momentu izgubili interes. Pa ne bom laično zapisal, da so Izraelci z nekaj novimi droni nagnali strah v kosti Katarcem in njihovim izvajalcem. Na tej točki je premirje zanje sprejemljivejše od konflikta, ker se je Izrael izkazal za vojaško trdnejšega od predhodnih ocen, in upal bi si reči, da je Hamas utrpel večje izgube od prvotno načrtovanih, hkrati pa bi z novimi sistemi Izrael lahko znatno razširil območje svojih operacij, tega pa si arabski sosedje ne želijo. Ukrajinci so uspešno targetirali Moskvo. Kaj lahko sledi na Bližnjem Vzhodu, naj zaključi vsak sam.\n\nZamolčane resnice\n\nČeprav je središče svetovne pozornosti trenutno območje Gaze, pa se po celotnem Izraelu in okolici dogajajo stvari, ki jih v resnici nihče ne komentira, v njih pa Izrael nastopa kot žrtev. Libanonski Hezbolah tako redno izvaja vpade na sever Izraela (tudi po več dnevno), v zadnjem tednu so jemenski Hutiji pod sponzorstvom Irana zajeli vsaj dve izraelski tovorni ladji in, nenazadnje, kljub premirju palestinski militanti na Zahodnem bregu v svoje vrste novačijo nove borce ter delujejo na izraelske cilje. Tudi takšnih spopadov se odvije po več dnevno, a vrli glavni mediji ne poročajo, koliko jih je na kateri strani umrlo. Ne povedo niti, da so se sploh zgodili.\n\nNamesto tega tako v Delu berem, da Izrael kljub premirju »nadaljuje s pobijanjem«. Ne govorijo o tem, da Hamas Rdečemu križu prepoveduje vstop v Gazo. Bog ne daj o tem, kar je v nedavnem intervjuju za Domovino povedal veliki popotnik in človekoljub Tomo Križnar, da je Hamas lastnemu ljudstvu večji sovražnik kot Izrael. Kot sem ocenjeval tudi sam, je Hamas kriv za tisoče neupravičenih smrti. Do onemoglosti pa se govori o smrti treh domnevnih civilistov, ki so se hoteli vrniti na sever območja Gaze, ki ga trenutno zaseda Izrael. Vsaka smrt je tragična, a resnica statistike je neizprosna.\n\nKonflikt se ne končuje\n\nS trenutnim premirjem se konflikt zgolj ustavlja, ne pa tudi končuje. Vsako premirje je ob zadostni politični volji sicer lahko vogelni kamen za gradnjo trajnega miru, a zaradi globalnih interesov velikih sil dvomim, da bo v danem primeru tako.\n\nPomembno je, da Izrael vojaško ni podlegel, in če se v kratkem ne vplete v kakšno kataklizmično totalno vojno, lahko pričakujemo, da se bo celo okrepil. Pomembno pa je tudi, da kljub skrajno agresivni propagandi, ki jo po svetu in predvsem po Zahodu uvaja levi pol, osvajanje »hearts and minds« z igranjem žrtve Hamasovcem ni uspelo do te mere, da bi vplivali na svetovno politiko in Zahod obrnili proti Izraelu.\n\nTisti, ki odločajo, na srečo niso nasedli poklicnim skrajnim aktivistom. Če sta nasedli Greta Thunberg in Tina Gaber, pa je to zgolj slaba komedija, nikakor pa ne tragedija.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 248, "end": 253}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 339, "end": 700}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 1662, "end": 1711}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1663, "end": 1670}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1685, "end": 1695}], "article_id": "4434", "lang": "sl", "text": "V novem letu je škoda živeti ekoanksiozno\n\nKonec leta delamo refleksijo za nazaj, mnogi delajo zaobljube za naprej. Sama že kakšni dve leti ob vsaki akciji izboljševanja sebe dodam še boj proti otopelosti, pasivnosti in pritoževanju. Vse troje žal nažira tudi mene, čeprav mi neredko močno preseda, kako sprijaznjeni so ljudje, posebej še mladi, z vso tragiko, ki jo prinaša življenje, kako zelo vdani v usodo, kako prepričani, da se itak nič ne da, kako pogosto tako preveč plehki in površinski, polni praznine, lačni smisla, ki ga nikakor ne uspejo najti, in zagozdeni v nesrečno vlačenje od dneva do dneva, ne da bi sploh vedeli, kaj hočejo, in ne da bi bili resnično protagonisti svojega življenja.\n\nNikakor namreč ni nepomembno, kako se lotevamo življenja. Imamo načrt ali gremo s tokom? Se za kaj borimo ali le sprejemamo udarce življenja? Razmislimo o stvareh ali sprejmemo stališča, ki jih že oblikovana od nekje dobimo na pladnju? … Tudi prelom leta je priložnost za razmislek, kako živimo in kaj bi od življenja pravzaprav radi. Novoletne želje niso le seznam za kakšnega od dobrih mož, ki, potem ko naredimo seznam, kar padejo z neba. V veliki meri je namreč pot, ki jo sami izberemo, tista, ki narekuje, koliko bomo v življenju vse tisto, kar si v teh dneh voščimo: zdravi, srečni, veseli, mirni, zadovoljni …\n\nTo poleg opomnika za novo leto pišem tudi zato, ker se mi včasih zdi, da smo dan današnji vse boljši v kovanju novih izrazov, kamuflaž in tržnih produktov za težave, s katerimi bi se morali odkrito soočiti, kot pa v iskanju konkretnih smiselnih rešitev zanje. Primerov je malo morje. Debelost je že tak lep primer, kjer se to redno počne. »Filanje« s hormoni in pohabljenje otrok in mladih namesto ukvarjanja s konkretnimi duševnimi težavami je že precej resnejši primer tega. Zadnji, ki sem ga zasledila, je pa ekoanksioznost.\n\nZdi se mi kot skovanka za vse tiste (mlade), ki jim nihče ne zna pokazati, kako se konkretno spopasti s krutostjo sveta in življenja ter jim namesto tega dajo nalepko kvazi diagnoze, da se nato vse vrti okrog te nalepke namesto okrog reševanja vzroka za to, da človek živi v strahu pred prihodnostjo in ohromljen od nemoči in zaskrbljenosti gleda v svet, ki med njegovim ukvarjanjem s samim seboj ni nič manj klavrn. To pa je daleč od namena, zakaj vsi mi na tem svetu smo.  \n\n»Poskusite zapustiti ta svet za spoznanje boljši, kot ste ga prejeli,« je skavtom v svojem zadnjem pismu položil na srce njihov ustanovitelj Robert Baden-Powell. A misel v resnici velja za vsakega človeka. Gotovo pa še posebej za vse tiste, ki jih skrbi za prihodnost – tako planeta kot tudi vseh njegovih prebivalcev.\n\nPrihodnost kateregakoli človeka pa tudi sveta ne bo svetla, če bomo namesto prevzema najprej lastne odgovornosti in spremembe pri sebi, ki se od tod lahko širi tudi na druge in širšo družbo, izumljali nemedicinske diagnoze za znana čustvena stanja (ki v hujših oblikah lahko potrebujejo tudi strokovno pomoč). Smisel negativnih čustev ni v tem, da se vanje zapletemo kot muha v pajčevino, ampak da usmerjena v smiselno akcijo spremenijo človekovo ravnanje, njega samega in svet okrog njega.\n\nJasno ne na način kot nad stanjem sveta danes mnogi svetujejo ekoanksioznim – z odločitvijo, da nimajo otrok ali da kar sklenejo svoje življenje, da bo okolje manj obremenjeno. Nič ne daje življenju večjega smisla kot ustvarjanje novega življenja. Pa ne samo z rojevanjem, seveda. A vendar tudi tako. Prihodnost sveta so pač le vsi tisti, ki se bodo odločili za življenje.\n\nKratki film Mož, ki je sadil drevesa  (L'homme qui plantait des arbres) nazorno pokaže, kako lahko na prvi pogled čisto majhno, a vztrajno in nesebično delo enega samega človeka ogromno prispeva k dobremu. Čeprav je osrednji lik izmišljen, je zgodba, ki je navdihnila že mnoge, povsem realna ter ob letošnjem koncu leta morda v navdih in pomoč še komu – posebej pa ekoanksioznim in drugače obupanim nad stanjem sveta.\n\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 0, "end": 14}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 16, "end": 30}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 33, "end": 50}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 62, "end": 68}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 192, "end": 206}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 240, "end": 251}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 297, "end": 348}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 660, "end": 714}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 660, "end": 852}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 720, "end": 734}, {"tag": "Red_Herring", "start": 1274, "end": 1307}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1487, "end": 1503}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1588, "end": 1728}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1844, "end": 1937}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1940, "end": 2080}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2158, "end": 2194}], "article_id": "4435", "lang": "sl", "text": "Samodestrukcija ameriške levice\n\nTeroristični napad Hamasa je šokiral celoten Zahod, ta pa je nemudoma izrazil vso podporo Izraelu.

Stališča o konfliktu so vnesla močan razdor med demokrate, kar pa že pušča posledice na Bidnovem predsedniškem položaju, ki je že tako majav. Slednji je namreč pod velikim pritiskom progresivnih in muslimanskih volivcev, ki njegovo neomajno podporo Izraelu vidijo kot izdajo, ceno za to pa zna na račun muslimanskih in arabskih volivcev plačati na prihodnjih volitvah.

S tem pa se bodo odprla dodatna vprašanja o izraelskem ravnanju s Palestinci ob tem, da muslimanski volivci izraelskemu premierju očitajo in zamerijo podporo izgonu Arabcev iz Izraela in krčenju pravic skupnosti LGBTQ+.\n\nDemokrati se sicer trudijo ostati enotni glede podpore Izraelu, vendar je skoraj 100 političnih predstavnikov težko uskladiti.

Organizirali so demonstracije, pisali odprta pisma, eden od njegovih uradnikov je v znak protesta celo odstopil. Bidnov položaj je torej močno ogrožen doma, njegove možnosti za novo izvolitev pa vedno manjše. Ironično ob vsem tem je, da se je ameriška levica na vsak način trudila zrušiti kredibilnost in podporo nekdanjemu predsedniku Donaldu Trumpu, ki pa mu, če sodimo po zadnjih anketah, podpora raste.

"text": "Klimatski zapor\n\nPoplave, požari, uničujoča vročina. Ozračje že kar nekaj poletij zapored dobesedno vre in kipi. Posledice podnebnih sprememb postajajo katastrofalne. Raziskava evropskih znanstvenikov, objavljena prejšnji mesec, je pokazala, da je lani v Evropi med 30. majem in 4. septembrom zaradi vročine umrlo 61.672 ljudi. Največ v Italiji, Grčiji, Španiji, na Portugalskem, v Bolgariji in na Hrvaškem. Natančnih podatkov za letos seveda še ni. Toda glede na to, da so letošnji vročinski valovi še hujši od lanskih (julij je bil najtoplejši doslej), bo število žrtev gotovo preseglo lansko številko. \n\nJoan Ballester, profesor z Inštituta za globalno zdravje v Barceloni, ki je vodil to raziskavo, pravi, da so lanske poletne temperature prav vsak teden presegale srednje vrednosti zadnjih treh desetletij. Najhujša vročina je po jugu Evrope udarila med 18. in 24. julijem in v pičlem tednu dni umorila 11.637 ljudi. Ana Maria Vicedo-Cabrera z univerze v Bernu, ki je prav tako sodelovala v raziskavi, meni, da je lanska vročina zanesljivo odnesla še bistveno več življenj. Največ žrtev je seveda med starejšimi, zlasti med ženskami, ki jih vročina prej izčrpa kot moške. \n\nBoj švicarskih žensk\n\nZato ni nič nenavadnega, da se je skupina starejših žensk v Švici odločila tožiti svojo vlado, ker se ta sila neučinkovito loteva boja proti podnebnim spremembam. KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz, kot se po nemško imenuje skupina, ki jo podpira lokalni Greenpeace, ima že več kot 2.400 članic, starih 64 in več let. Prvo tožbo proti švicarski vladi so vložile že leta 2016. Obtožile so jo, da premalo stori za zaščito državljanov pred uničujočimi vplivi podnebnih sprememb, čeprav bi to morala početi, pravi Elisabeth Stern, upokojena etnologinja.\n\nTožba je bila zavrnjena na vseh ravneh. Tudi na vrhovnem sodišču, ki je sklenilo, da pravice žensk pravzaprav niso bile (dovolj) poteptane in da se je za spremembe treba boriti po politični in ne po pravni poti. Toda švicarske bojevnice se niso pustile ugnati in so s svojo tožbo odšle na Evropsko sodišče za človekove pravice v Strasbourg, ki naj bi odločitev o tem, ali imajo prav ali ne, sprejelo tja do konca letošnjega leta.\n\nTo je prvi podnebni primer, ki ga je sodišče v Strasbourgu vzelo v obravnavo. \"Po svoje zgodovinska odločitev, saj se kaj takšnega še pred desetimi leti preprosto ne bi moglo zgoditi,\" pravi Corina Heri z univerze v Zürichu. Boj žensk iz skupine KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz je po njenem seveda povsem na mestu.\n\nLansko poletje je bilo namreč v Švici najtoplejše doslej, letošnje bo verjetno še bolj. Mnogi starejši ljudje so se pred vročino zapirali v stanovanja. \"To je bil za mnoge pravi podnebni 'lockdown'! Pravi klimatski zapor,\" pravijo švicarske seniorke. Prevroče poletje je poleg tega povzročilo tajanje ledenikov, kakršnega doslej še ni bilo. Ti bodo do leta 2100 v Švici malone povsem izginili, če vlada – in skupaj z njo seveda tudi vse vlade sveta – ne bo dramatično zaustavila emisije toplogrednih plinov in posledično prevelikega segrevanja ozračja.\n\nMladi Portugalci tožijo tudi Slovenijo\n\nPo švicarski pritožbi je sodišče v Strasbourgu sprejelo v obravnavo še dve zadevi, povezani s teptanjem človekovih pravic zaradi premalo odločnega boja proti podnebnim spremembam. Eno je podpisal Damien Carême, evropski poslanec Zelenih, nekoč župan francoskega mesta Grande-Synthe, ki je pravzaprav predmestje Dunkerqua, drugo pa skupina šestih mladih Portugalcev, ki toži vseh 27 članic Evropske unije, torej tudi Slovenijo, poleg njih pa še Veliko Britanijo, Norveško, Rusijo, Ukrajino, Švico in Turčijo. Skupaj torej 33 držav.\n\nMladi Portugalci opozarjajo, da vlade prepočasi uresničujejo obveze o omejitvi globalnega segrevanja, zato ogrožajo njihovo pravico do zdravega življenja. Eden od šesterice na primer zaradi požarov kar nekaj časa ni mogel v šolo, drugemu je pepel prekril domači vrt in vso hišo. Vlade zato morajo ukrepati, pravijo, saj je zaradi njihove neaktivnosti ogrožena prihodnost vseh, najbolj pa seveda mladih.\n\nPočasno nasilje\n\nPosledice nebrzdanega razvoja, ki ga v gonji za dobičkom zahteva zdajšnji \"disaster kapitalizem\", so za naravo, od katere smo pravzaprav usodno odvisni, marsikje v resnici katastrofalne. Opustošenje je ponekod popolno. Nekateri okoljsko opustošenje imenujejo kar počasno nasilje (ang. slow violence), lepo zapiše profesorica Darja Zaviršek:\n\n\"Zemlja s posekanega grajskega griča na Ptuju drsi počasi, Ljubljana se počasi segreva. Počasi občutimo pomanjkanje kakovostne pitne vode in hrane. Predeli sveta, kjer so še pred kratkim živeli ljudje, danes niso več primerni za bivanje. Okoljska degradacija se v družbeno tkivo zajeda počasi, najprej je sploh ne opazimo, še več, zdi se polna obetov. Tu cesta več, tam parkirišče, tu poseke in betonski jezovi. Primeri urbanega načrtovanja se ponekod v resnici izkažejo kot počasno nasilje, ki s svojo silo povzroči divjanje voda in poplave, ki so nedolgo nazaj uničile Slovenijo.\"\n\nA ko pride do katastrofe, to mnogi še vedno občutijo zgolj kot nasilje narave in ne kot posledico človekovega nespametnega ravnanja z njo. Nad tem dejstvom je bila silno presenečena tudi Christy Lefteri, novinarka in pisateljica, avtorica knjige Book of Fire, ki je izšla sredi avgusta. Letos poleti je veliko pisala o požarih v Grčiji. Ti seveda še zdaleč niso divjali zgolj zato, ker je nekdo, denimo, odvrgel cigaretni ogorek, ampak predvsem zaradi večletnega globalnega segrevanja in izsuševanja zemlje. Toda ljudje, žrtve strašnih grških požarov, kljub tej strahotni izkušnji tega nočejo priznati. Krivdo še vedno raje valijo na enega posameznika, na eno korporacijo, na eno državo, kar je seveda popolnoma zgrešeno.\n\nNa to v svoji knjigi Engaging With Climate Change (Soočanje s podnebnimi spremembami) opozarja tudi psihoanalitičarka Sally Weintrobe. Mnogi ljudje, ki sicer sprejemajo dejstvo, da se Zemlja segreva, ta problem praviloma vselej odrivajo nekam v prihodnost. To počnejo celo ljudje, ki so na svoji koži občutili grozo požarov ali poplav. Morda je realnost pretežka in preveč boleča, občutek krivde pa premočan, da bi se lahko pogumno spopadali z njo, v knjigi razmišlja Sally Weintrobe. V mislih je gotovo imela tudi nesposobne politike …\n\nSe Zemlja res ohlaja?\n\nTovrstno zanikanje dejstev je močno prisotno tudi v Sloveniji, zlasti v vrstah skrajne desnice. Branko Grims je leta 2018 denimo izjavil: \"Govorjenje o segrevanju Zemlje je velika laž. Zemlja se v resnici ohlaja …\" Ali pa izjava Janeza Janše avgusta lani v Bovcu: \"Včasih smo ljudje malo preveč samovšečni in mislimo, da mi sami lahko vplivamo na to, kaj se dogaja s podnebjem in naravo na planetu …\" Kakor da sta oba vneto poslušala Donalda Trumpa, Jaira Bolsonara in druge podobne podnebne skeptike, ki jih je seveda tudi doma ogromno.\n\nMostovi iz lepenke…\n\nNarava je seveda v resnici velikokrat povsem nepredvidljiva, toda dejstvo je, da bi bile posledice nedavne ujme pri nas precej milejše, če bi se vse vlade v zadnjih treh desetletjih resneje ukvarjale s strugami rek in poplavnimi območji in bistveno manj z bolnimi poskusi reinterpretacije preteklosti.\n\nZakaj je bilo treba privatizirati in s tem uničiti izvrstno državno podjetje, ki se je učinkovito ukvarjalo z reguliranjem in urejanjem vodotokov? Zakaj so pristojni dovoljevali gradnjo na poplavnih območjih in na bregovih rek? Zakaj so se mostovi podirali, kakor da bi bili zgrajeni iz lepenke? Tudi zato, ker današnja infrastruktura ni več primerna za podnebne spremembe, v katerih živimo. Mnoge vlade tega začuda doslej (še) niso opazile. Zato bo treba marsikaj, tudi v Sloveniji, postaviti in zgraditi na novo.\n\nOči mnogih so zdaj uprte v Strasbourg. Razsodba o vplivu podnebnih sprememb na človekove pravice in na pravico do dostojnega življenja v času katastrof bo seveda prelomna. Toda dejstvo je, da sodišča ne morejo reševati globalnega segrevanja. Za to je pristojna predvsem izvršna veja oblasti, ki pa je v preteklih desetletjih v svoji samovšečni narcisoidnosti, tudi v Sloveniji, prepogosto pozabljala na svet okrog sebe, neznosno popuščala interesom do okolja neprijaznih korporacij in kapitala in s tem v boju s podnebnimi spremembami zamudila že skoraj vse, kar se je zamuditi dalo. Tako pa tudi uničila prihodnost mnogih. Bati se je, da bo zdaj lahko samo še gasila požare in črpala vodo iz poplavljenih domov, podnebje pa se bo še naprej nemoteno peklensko segrevalo.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 9, "end": 16}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 19, "end": 133}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 26, "end": 37}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 84, "end": 95}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 403, "end": 412}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 553, "end": 560}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 553, "end": 742}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 659, "end": 668}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 777, "end": 791}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 830, "end": 834}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 837, "end": 1066}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 878, "end": 890}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 970, "end": 1066}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 1071, "end": 1179}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1080, "end": 1085}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1280, "end": 1360}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1313, "end": 1339}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1394, "end": 1488}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1545, "end": 1563}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1595, "end": 1666}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1808, "end": 1830}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1950, "end": 1988}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1969, "end": 1988}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2299, "end": 2436}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2404, "end": 2429}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2439, "end": 2520}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2564, "end": 2836}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2588, "end": 2595}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2597, "end": 2636}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 2639, "end": 2692}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2676, "end": 2692}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2765, "end": 2780}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2765, "end": 2806}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2789, "end": 2796}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2895, "end": 2902}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2950, "end": 2965}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3018, "end": 3064}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3049, "end": 3057}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 3143, "end": 3220}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3148, "end": 3166}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3175, "end": 3197}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3234, "end": 3291}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3271, "end": 3291}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3423, "end": 3545}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3558, "end": 3562}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3623, "end": 3748}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3809, "end": 3859}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4034, "end": 4063}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4084, "end": 4098}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 4158, "end": 4240}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4216, "end": 4235}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4244, "end": 4266}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 4269, "end": 4779}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4358, "end": 4373}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4425, "end": 4496}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4811, "end": 4819}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 4905, "end": 4938}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 4941, "end": 5003}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5006, "end": 5145}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5321, "end": 5333}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5415, "end": 5425}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5505, "end": 5513}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5715, "end": 5726}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5812, "end": 6030}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 5812, "end": 6030}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5834, "end": 5853}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5858, "end": 5875}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5878, "end": 5952}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 5904, "end": 5921}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6041, "end": 6049}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6143, "end": 6166}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6230, "end": 6255}, {"tag": "Red_Herring", "start": 6258, "end": 6297}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 6300, "end": 6302}], "article_id": "4438", "lang": "sl", "text": "Vsi naši rusofili\n\nKo so \"zeleni možje Vladimirja Putina leta 2014 zasedli Krim, so padli v vodo načrti za gradnjo plinovoda Južni tok. Dve leti pozneje je ruski predsednik obiskal Slovenijo. Bobo\n\nZdi se kot uvodni prizor iz filma o britanskem tajnem agentu Jamesu Bondu. V tišini neke noči v bližino danskega otoka Bornholm pripluje podmornica ali ladja, ki je očitno nevidna za radarje. Tja pripelje diverzante v potapljaški opremi, ki na dva podvodna plinovoda namestijo mino ali drugo eksplozivno sredstvo. Nato neopazno odidejo, cevi pa raznese.\n\nSabotaža plinovodov Severni tok 1 in 2 ne bo \"le\" močno otežila energetske oskrbe Nemčije, ampak ima tudi velikanski simbolni pomen. Z njo je vojna v Ukrajini neposredno segla v jedro Evrope. Plinovodi, daljnovodi in druge \"žile dovodnice\" energije so očitno postale legitimna tarča. Obenem je eksplozija pod Baltskim morjem v prah sesula desetletje in pol nemške energetske politike. Označuje dokončni konec obdobja Angele Merkel, ki je ugašala domače jedrske elektrarne, da je lahko kupovala še več ruskega plina. \n\nCeno teh zablod bodo očitno plačali ljudje, ki se bodo v Nemčiji to zimo greli na sejmiščih in v telovadnicah. Dogajanje v Baltskem morju nam mora zato obuditi spomin na podobno zgodbo v našem delu Evrope. Na državo, ki je vrsto let z Moskvo pletla svoj \"posebni odnos\". Ime ji je Slovenija.\n\nSe še spomnite Južnega toka?\n\nZa Rusijo je bil plin vedno tudi orodje za demonstracijo moči in širjenje geostrateškega vpliva. Že kmalu po prihodu na oblast je Vladimir Putin našel velikega prijatelja v takratnem nemškem kanclerju Gerhardu Schroederju, pozneje lobistu največjih ruskih energetskih družb. Ko se je zveza Nato leta 2004 razširila čez meje nekdanje Sovjetske zveze, v Ukrajini pa je leto dni pozneje prišlo do oranžne revolucije, je kocka v Moskvi padla.\n\nTakrat so se v Rusiji odločili zgraditi dva nova kraka za nemoteni izvoz plina v Evropo - mimo Poljske, Ukrajine in drugih, za Kremelj problematičnih držav. Prvi, zdaj razstreljeni plinovod Severni tok je Rusijo pod Baltskim morjem neposredno povezal z Nemčijo. Drugi, nikoli zgrajeni Južni tok bi bil ruska pot do Italije. Vodila bi prek Črnega morja, Bolgarije, Srbije, Madžarske in Slovenije.\n\nV enaki meri kot energetska je bil Južni tok tudi politična zgodba. Verjetno ni naključje, da so tri od štirih držav na poti do Italije v poznejših letih na različne načine pad(a)le v politični objem Moskve. Tudi v četrti, Sloveniji, se je njen vpliv od leta 2006 naprej začel hitro krepiti. \n\nKo se šef Gazproma na letališču obrne\n\nPri nas je za Južni tok navijala pisana koalicija \"starih\" levih struktur, ki v Rusiji še vedno vidijo nekakšen branik slovanstva, njihovih poslovnih prijateljev z močnimi zvezami v Moskvi, posameznih desnih politikov, ki so zavohali provizije, in domačega plinskega lobija. Ta se je za prevlado v energetiki spopadal s šaleškimi \"termaši\", ki so takrat trasirali pot projektu TEŠ6, in jedrskim lobijem, ki je pripravljal teren za drugi blok nuklearke.\n\nDolgo časa se je zdelo, da je \"plinašem\" uspelo. Vrednost slovenskega dela Južnega toka je bila ocenjena na milijardo evrov. Toda vse je padlo v vodo, ko so Putinovi \"zeleni možje\" leta 2014 zasedli Krim. \n\nPred tem je ves čas prihajalo do čudnih, celo bizarnih pripetljajev. Leta 2009 je Ljubljano obiskal šef Gazproma Aleksej Miller. Tedanji vodja direktorata za energijo Janez Kopač mu je razložil, da gradnja plinovoda, ki bi imel po ruskem predlogu poseben upravljavski in davčni položaj, ob spoštovanju pravil EU ni mogoča. Miller je besen odšel, a se je njegov avtomobil na letališču obrnil nazaj. Vmes je namreč na hitro dobil nov termin pri takratnem predsedniku republike, ki je pri gostu očitno pustil precej boljši vtis. \n\nTri leta pozneje je Janez Janša obiskal Kremelj. Četudi je slovenska delegacija prišla ponujati tudi Petrol, ga je Putin več ur pustil čakati v hotelu – kot povračilo, ker je Janša pred petimi leti čez noč odpovedal prihod v Sankt Peterburg. Nad projektom Južni tok so v Sloveniji bdele oči ruskih obveščevalcev. V Bruslju pa je o usodi plinovoda odločal tedanji komisar za energetiko Guenther Oettinger. Danes je svetovalec Viktorja Orbana, vrsto let največjega Putinovega zaveznika v EU.\n\nŠirjenje ruskega vpliva\n\nZ obljubami o dodatnih količinah ruskega plina je v Slovenijo prišlo tudi vse ostalo. Od ruskih oligarhov, ki so kupovali podjetja (SIJ, Terme Maribor), do državne Sberbank, ki je prevzela financiranje dela domače poslovne elite. Od zunanje politike, ki se je ob prvem ruskem konfliktu z Ukrajino ponujala za mediatorja, do odpovedi plinu iz Alžirije. Od Putinovih obiskov do ruskih državnih odlikovanj. Od ruske univerze v Kopru do prihoda ruskih gardistov na slovesnost ob ruski kapelici v letu aneksije Krima.\n\nAli kot je pred desetletjem evforično napovedal tedanji predsednik društva slovensko-ruskega prijateljstva Saša Geržina: \"Rusi so dokončno odkrili Slovenijo. Pri nas bodo podobno močno prisotni kot Francozi ali Avstrijci!\" Kmalu zatem se mu je uspelo prebiti v jedro slovenske energetike: med nadzornike Gen Energije, solastnice slovenske polovice krške nuklearke. \n\nDanes se nekateri v Sloveniji zgražajo nad slabo prikritimi simpatijami nekaterih vplivnih mnenjskih voditeljev nad Rusijo. Toda pri tem pozabljajo, da to ni pojav, ki bi prišel z neba ali bil zgolj kulturno pogojen. Najmanj desetletje po letu 2006 je bila namreč \"rusofilija\" na številnih ravneh tako rekoč uradna politika te države. V nekem trenutku je mehka moč Rusije v Sloveniji opazno presegala ekonomsko povezanost med državama. Celo v najboljših časih je naše gospodarstvo v Rusijo letno izvažalo trikrat manj blaga kot recimo v Italijo. \n\nVrsto let so nas resni ljudje prepričevali, da bi morala imeti Slovenija vlogo nekakšnega mostu med EU in Rusijo. Absurdno izenačevanje Rusije kot agresorja in Ukrajine kot žrtve, zavijanje odrekanja njene pravice do obrambe v celofan nekakšnega pacifizma in poizkusi relativizacije dejanj Putinovega režima so le derivat te doktrine. V našem utopičnem dojemanju mednarodnih odnosov se vojne pač končajo, ko se država s sončne strani Alp odloči pomahati z oljčno vejico, v resničnosti pa ne. Nismo središče sveta, ampak le njegov, razmeroma nepomembni košček, v katerem občasno snemajo akcijske filme. Žal. \n\nAli na srečo.  \n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 10, "end": 16}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 46, "end": 85}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 109, "end": 133}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 343, "end": 357}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 872, "end": 965}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 968, "end": 1009}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1208, "end": 1303}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1208, "end": 1303}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1393, "end": 1399}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1415, "end": 1607}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1610, "end": 1753}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 1803, "end": 1812}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1935, "end": 2067}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2048, "end": 2054}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2197, "end": 2203}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2297, "end": 2306}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2445, "end": 2460}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3038, "end": 3079}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3323, "end": 3338}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3401, "end": 3458}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3462, "end": 3488}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3491, "end": 3600}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3604, "end": 3624}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3636, "end": 3670}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 3746, "end": 3867}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3775, "end": 3781}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3871, "end": 3917}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3904, "end": 3917}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3920, "end": 4185}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4189, "end": 4247}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4250, "end": 4309}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4268, "end": 4285}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 4312, "end": 4462}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4370, "end": 4388}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4465, "end": 4710}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4561, "end": 4572}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4615, "end": 4621}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4675, "end": 4691}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 4745, "end": 4838}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4936, "end": 4965}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5015, "end": 5126}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 5129, "end": 5365}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5129, "end": 5215}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5150, "end": 5187}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5956, "end": 6016}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6071, "end": 6095}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6099, "end": 6183}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 6270, "end": 6293}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 6746, "end": 6769}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 7317, "end": 7488}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 7491, "end": 7641}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 7644, "end": 7709}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 8190, "end": 8199}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 8204, "end": 8225}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 8228, "end": 8326}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 8353, "end": 8384}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 8522, "end": 8557}], "article_id": "4439", "lang": "sl", "text": "Orožje za genocid\n\nGaza že dolgo ni več zgolj največji in najstrašnejši zapor na svetu, ampak je hkrati tudi najokrutnejši laboratorij, ki ga izraelska orožarska in tehnološka industrija že desetletja uporablja za preizkuse svojih izdelkov na živih ljudeh.\n\nPalestinci v Gazi (in tudi na Zahodnem bregu) so za izraelsko vlado postali nekakšne poskusne živali, na katerih vojska, tajne službe in tovarne orožja že desetletja testirajo svoje v svetu visoko cenjene tehnološke produkte. Od dronov, tehnologije za nadzor in prepoznavanje obrazov do eksperimentalnih bomb, mitraljeških gnezd, ki jih upravlja umetna inteligenca, in imenitnih ograj, kakršna je tista v Gazi, ki je od sveta surovo za dolgo odrezala skoraj 2,5 milijona ljudi.\n\nVse te nove tehnološke pridobitve Izrael uspešno prodaja po vsem svetu. S potrdilom, da je bilo vse to učinkovito preizkušeno v bojih. Koliko Palestincev je bilo doslej pobitih v tem strašnem laboratoriju, kupcem seveda ne povedo. Pravzaprav jih to v bistvu sploh ne zanima.\n\nSamo v zdajšnji vojni v Gazi je žrtev že blizu 15 tisoč, med njimi je več kot pet tisoč otrok. Veliko je pogrešanih. Najmanj tri tisoč. Bržkone so za vedno zasuti pod ruševinami uničenih zgradb. Če bi svet v resnici zanimala usoda Palestincev, bi bila ta vojna kajpak že zdavnaj zaustavljena. Za vedno in ne samo za nekaj ur na dan, kot se dogaja v zdajšnjem premirju.\n\nIzrael in genocid v Srebrenici\n\nIzrael je že dolgo eden največjih izvoznikov orožja. V uradnih statistikah je na desetem mestu svetovnih lestvic. Lani je država prodala za 12,5 milijarde dolarjev vojaške tehnologije in orožja. Med kupci je blizu 140 držav. Med njimi so malone vse avtokratske države in diktature tega sveta. Denar namreč ne smrdi, pa naj bo še tako krvav.\n\nOrožje so tako prodajali Južni Afriki za časa apartheida. Vojaškim režimom v Latinski Ameriki in v Burmi. Z izraelskim (in turškim) orožjem je Azerbajdžan zavzel Gorski Karabah. In med vojno v Jugoslaviji je uradni Jeruzalem ves čas prodajal orožje Srbom, tako da je Izrael posredno kriv za genocid v Srebrenici.\n\nIzraelski odvetnik Itay Mack in profesor Jair Oron sta leta 2016 javno zahtevala razkritje podatkov o izraelski vpletenosti v genocid v Bosni in Hercegovini. Izraelskemu vrhovnemu sodišču sta predložila konkretne dokaze o tej smrtonosni trgovini z orožjem in neposrednim sodelovanjem Izraelcev pri urjenju srbskih čet. Med drugim sta sodnike opozorila na dnevniški odstavek vojnega zločinca generala Ratka Mladića, ugledne poslovne stranke izraelskih orožarjev, ki je v svojem zasebnem dnevniku jasno zapisal, da je Srbija med vojno sodelovala z Izraelom.\n\nSodišče (ne)hote priznalo krivdo\n\nDobrila Gajić-Glišić, ki je delala v beograjskem ministrstvu za obrambo, je leta 1992 izdala knjigo z naslovom Srbska vojska, kjer je natančno opisala ta velik orožarski posel z Izraelom. Sklenil ga je Jezdimir Vasiljević, znan srbski bančnik, ki je bil tesno povezan s Slobodanom Miloševićem. Ta prvi in hkrati eden največjih poslov je bil sklenjen oktobra 1991 v Izraelu.\n\n\"Takrat ta zadeva seveda ni smela v javnost. To je bil zapleten in težak posel. Toda stvar se je končala z uspehom,\" med drugim zapiše Gajić-Glišićeva. Takrat je za območje nekdanje Jugoslavije že veljal embargo na trgovino z orožjem. Posel je bil sklenjen v času, ko so Srbi že začeli uničevalni pohod na Vukovar in ko so na Dubrovnik začele padati prve granate. In to seveda še zdaleč ni bil edini orožarski posel s Srbi.\n\nSklep je bil sila nenavaden. S tovrstno formulacijo je namreč sodišče v bistvu (ne)hote priznalo izraelsko sokrivdo za genocid v Srebrenici.\n\nDvakratni molk Evrope\n\nZdajšnje brutalno in načrtno uničevanje Gaze je bržkone že prestopilo tenko črto, ki vojne zločine ločuje od genocida. Da bi v resnici lahko šlo za genocid, že lep čas previdno opozarjajo mnogi ugledni pravniki in intelektualci z vsega sveta.\n\nNihče noče direktno uporabiti te strašne besede. Izraelski politiki in generalni nimajo tovrstnih zadržkov. S svojimi besedami in dejanji iz dneva v dan dokazujejo, da je brisanje Gaze in prebivalstva, ki živi v tem laboratoriju, pravzaprav glavni cilj zdajšnjega uničevanja vsega živega, tudi bolnišnic, šol, mošej.\n\nA Evropa začuda noče videti, kaj se v Gazi v resnici dogaja. Molčala je, ko je nacistična Nemčija pobijala Jude med vojno. In zaradi tega strašnega občutka krivde, tako imenovanega sindroma holokavsta, molči tudi zdaj, ko Palestinci postajajo žrtev žrtve takratnega genocida. Krivda Evrope tako postaja dvojna. Nič ni naredila takrat, ko bi pravzaprav morala reagirati na pokončevanje Judov, in še manj je storila v tokratnem masakru Izraela nad nedolžnimi civilisti. Tudi ko je šlo za načrtno pobijanje palestinskih otrok.\n\nFrontex kot podaljšek Izraela\n\nA tovrstno ravnanje Evrope je, gledano kajpak skozi očala orožarjev, vendarle dokaj razumljivo. Izrael je namreč eden ključnih zaveznikov Evropske unije pri militarizaciji njenih meja in pri odganjanju nadležnih migrantov, ki iz kriznih žarišč prihajajo na našo celino. Evropska unija že lep čas sodeluje z vodilnimi izraelskimi vojaškimi korporacijami, zlasti s proizvajalci dronov. Izraelske izkušnje s preganjanjem in pobijanjem Palestincev so pri tem ključnega pomena, denimo piše Anthony Loewenstein v sijajni knjigi Palestinski laboratorij, ki ima podnaslov Kako Izrael izvaža okupacijsko tehnologijo po vsemu svetu.\n\nFrontex že kar nekaj časa uporablja izraelske drone Heron TP, znane kot Eitan, s katerimi nadzoruje poti migrantov in njihove borne barke, na katerih plujejo čez Sredozemlje. Te drone, ki so lahko v zraku tudi do štirideset ur, je mogoče opremiti s štirimi raketami spike. V njih je na tisoče majhnih, trimilimetrskih kock, ki prebijajo kovino in povzročajo strašne rane.\n\nDroni so imeli pomembno vlogo pri izraelskem napadu na Gazo. | Foto: Reuters Droni so imeli pomembno vlogo pri izraelskem napadu na Gazo. Foto: Reuters Te rakete Izrael že dolgo uporablja v obračunih s Palestinci. Evropske unije pri poslih z Izraelom to popolnoma nič ne moti. Izraelski droni tako postajajo pomembno orožje EU v lovu na nesrečne migrante. \"Frontex, ki bi načeloma moral pomagati beguncem, postaja nekakšna nova obmejna vojska. Z opremo, ki prihaja z vojnih območij,\" v knjigi zapiše Loewenstein.\n\nRdeči volk in avtomatizirani apartheid\n\nToda to še zdaleč ni edina izraelska tehnologija, ki jo s pridom uporablja Evropa. Izraelci so denimo izdelali izjemno sofisticiran sistem za prepoznavanje obrazov. Imenuje se Red Wolf. Žrtve tega digitalnega Rdečega volka so praktično vsi Palestinci na okupiranih območjih. Pred tem sistemom se ni mogoče skriti. Omejena je svoboda gibanja, velikokrat prihaja do diskriminacijskih racij in aretacij. V Amnesty International takšnemu nadzoru pravijo avtomatizirani apartheid. Francoski preiskovalni novinarji so odkrili, da ta software, ki ga proizvaja izraelsko podjetje BriefCam, že osem let nezakonito uporablja francoska policija.\n\nŠe bolj znan izraelski produkt je seveda sistem Pegasus, ki mobilni telefon spremeni v nadzorovalno napravo, kjer se mikrofoni in kamere vključujejo brez vednosti lastnika. Pegaza so denimo med drugim namestili Hanan Elatr, vdovi umorjenega saudskega novinarja Džamala Hasodžija. S Pegazom v žepu so hodili mnogi kritični novinarji in opozicijski politiki v Evropi in drugod po svetu. Madžarski premier Viktor Orban je bil izjemno navdušen nad njim, saj je s pomočjo izraelske tehnologije tako zlahka sledil, kaj počnejo in govorijo njegovi najhujši kritiki. Za ta sistem naj bi se – morda prav po madžarskem zgledu – resno zanimal tudi prejšnji slovenski premier, ko je bil na obisku pri Benjaminu Netanjahuju. Kdo ve, morda pa je Pegaz medtem res priletel že tudi v naše kraje.\n\nPalestinizacija globalnih konfliktov\n\nIzraelska tehnologija, v živo preizkušena na palestinskem življu, je danes prisotna na vseh kriznih žariščih sveta. Jeff Halper, avtor knjige Vojna proti ljudem, je tovrstno izvozno naravnanost Izraela in silno navdušenje kupcev nad v praksi preizkušenimi orožji in tehnologijami sijajno opisal kot palestinizacijo globalnih konfliktov. \n\nTisti, ki opozarjajo na tovrstne tajne kupčije in na zločine nad civilisti, seveda v hipu postanejo antisemiti in zagovorniki teroristov. Izraelska vlada se je zdaj zaradi kritičnega pisanja spravila celo na osrednji domači dnevnik Harec. Obtožila ga je, da širi lažnivo, defetistično propagando in mu zaradi kritičnega poročanja zdaj grozi celo s kaznijo. Toda v Harecu so na napade s strani vlade mirno in hladnokrvno odgovorili: \"Zdaj je torej čas, da nas berete …\"   \n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 463, "end": 469}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 600, "end": 607}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1280, "end": 1287}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1395, "end": 1459}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1650, "end": 1664}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1650, "end": 1796}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1724, "end": 1731}], "article_id": "444", "lang": "sl", "text": "Pakistan zapustilo pol milijona afganistanskih beguncev\n\nVečina beguncev odšla v strahu pred aretacijo\n\nOd oktobra, ko je Pakistan napovedal izgon afganistanskih prebežnikov, je državo zapustilo že več kot pol milijona ljudi, med katerimi jih je po mnenju Združenih narodov več kot 60 odstotkov mlajših od 18 let.\n\nPakistanska vlada je beguncem brez urejenega dovoljenja za bivanje ukazala, da morajo do 1. novembra zapustiti državo.

Slednje bi znalo biti povezano s preozkimi hlačami. To je podoba novodobnih poženščenih moških, ki jih je z vsakim letom več. Proces, ki je pritegnil pozornost javnosti z vznikom metroseksualcev na prelomu stoletja, je dosegel svoj logični konec.\n\nVznik metroseksualcev so pontifi javnega mnenja pred tremi desetletji slavili kot prihod nove potrošniške kohorte, ki bo tako kot ženske z veseljem zapravljala denar na oblačila in kozmetiko. Dlje od tega, da se je pojavila skupina moških, ki bi po novem skrbela edino zase in za nikogar drugega v svojem življenju, se v javnosti ni zares razpravljalo. Nihče se niti ni želel zares posvetiti implikacijam takega vprašanja. Je namreč zelo neprijetno vprašanje.\n\nČe se je začelo z metroseksualci, pa je od takrat prišlo do svojevrstne proliferacije različnih skupin moških, ki jim ni do tega, da bi se ukvarjali z ženskami, ki krivijo družbo, da se ženske ne zanimajo zanje, in tistih, ki so nekje vmes. Čedalje pogosteje je slišati tudi pripombe žensk, da je te dni nemogoče najti “pravega” moškega. Da so moški, ki se zanimajo zanje ali pa so z njimi, vase zagledane reve, mamini sinčki in najrazličnejši sluzavci. Kakršno je povpraševanje, takšna je tudi ponudba. Feminizem je dosegel svoje. Na Zahodu nič novega.\n\nNa Kitajskem je drugače tudi zaradi večdesetletne politike enega otroka. Če ima Zahod v svojem sizifovskem boju proti “toksični” moškosti (bele) moške za dežurne krivce, se v Aziji spopadajo z vprašanjem, kako rešiti problem poženščenih moških. V 2018 je bila na spletni strani kitajske tiskovne agencije Xinhua objavljena kolumna, v kateri so člane popskupine New F4 označili za reve in “ne moške, temveč ženske”. Očitali so jim androginost, šibkost in ličenje. Škodljiv vpliv te “bolne kulture” na kitajsko mladino je po trditvah avtorja neizmerljiv. Mimogrede, sodišče v provinci Jiangsu je nedavno dalo prav založniku, čigar učbenik je homoseksualnost opisoval kot psihološko motnjo.\n\nKrivca našli v ameriški obveščevalni službi CIA\n\nKitajska akademija za družbene vede je krivca za nastalo stanje že leta 2019 našla v ameriški obveščevalni službi CIA. Ta je v 60. letih prek zvezdniške agencije začela ustvarjati nov videz poženščenih moških na Japonskem z namenom, da bi se rešili problematičnega japonskega militarističnega duha. Koncept se je prijel, trend se je iz Japonske razširil v Južno Korejo, od tam pa prodrl na Kitajsko. Kitajci imajo glede CIA bržkone prav. Navsezadnje ustvarjanje percepcije sveta, t. j. pranje nasprotnikovih možganov, ne da bi ta vedel, spada v opis dela obveščevalnih služb. Kar je bistveno, Kitajci so se odločili, da temu naredijo konec. Na kratko bi lahko rekli, da želijo dečkom v izobraževalnem procesu zagotoviti dober zgled prave moškosti.\n\nTega bi se Kitajci lotili tako, da bi športno vzgojo poučevali upokojeni atleti. Šole v državi bodo po drugi strani morale zagotoviti, da so učitelji športne vzgoje v dobri fizični kondiciji. Več poudarka bo na športih v šolskem okviru. Učenci in dijaki, ki niso invalidi, a ne dosegajo predpisanih standardov telesne pripravljenosti, ne bodo mogli končati šolanja. Namen kitajskih oblasti je narediti šport za ključni element kitajskega izobraževalnega sistema. Zdrav duh v zdravem telesu so s tem pripeljali na novo raven, saj so komunistične oblasti prepričane, da edino državljani, ki ne bodo poženščene reve, lahko vodijo državo.\n\nA navsezadnje je tudi Kitajska del našega sveta, in če feminizem smeti po Zahodu, ni na Kitajskem nič drugače. Predlog kitajskih oblasti so pričakale obtožbe, kako bo na tak način prihajalo do povečanja družinskega nasilja. Kritiki si želijo, da bi raje od možatosti v dečkih gojili sočutnost in odkritost. Tu se podobnosti z Zahodom končajo. Kajti medtem ko na Zahodu zatirajo dečke v šolah in se trudijo skozi celoten izobraževalni proces iz njih izbiti vsakršno senco možatosti, komunistična oblast na Kitajskem dela po svoje.\n\nMedtem ko se je Zahod moškosti pripravljen odreči, jo sprevreči in jo preganjati, jo na Kitajskem vidijo kot temeljni gradnik kitajske prihodnosti. Temeljni kamen kitajske renesanse je možatost.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 178, "end": 303}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 608, "end": 836}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 700, "end": 836}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1333, "end": 1544}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1573, "end": 1705}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1767, "end": 1853}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1905, "end": 2013}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2070, "end": 2112}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 2115, "end": 2338}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2491, "end": 2530}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2646, "end": 2715}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 2831, "end": 2836}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 2849, "end": 2856}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 2939, "end": 3021}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 3040, "end": 3080}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 3190, "end": 3202}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 3269, "end": 3331}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3527, "end": 3530}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 3557, "end": 3653}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3804, "end": 3947}], "article_id": "4442", "lang": "sl", "text": "Problem nasilja nad ženskami se tiče vseh nas, ne samo žensk\n\nOsmega marca bo na Kongresnem trgu v Ljubljani shod proti nasilju nad ženskami, na katerega so vabljeni tudi moški, ki bi radi sodelovali v procesu spreminjanja trenutne družbe v bolj odprto ter vsem posameznicam in posameznikom bolj prijazno \n\nDelovni odbor za feminizem (DOFEM) študentske organizacije Iskra v petek, 8. marca, na mednarodni dan žensk, že tretje leto  zapored organizira protestni shod. Letos bo osrednja tematika boj proti nasilju nad ženskami. Glavno sporočilo shoda, ki se bo začel ob 17. uri na Kongresnem trgu v Ljubljani, je po besedah Mojce Žerak iz DOFEM institucionalizirati, uzakoniti zavračanje nasilja, saj \"ni dovolj, da nasilje nad ženskami in nad drugimi ranljivimi skupinami le obsodimo na načelni ravni, pokazati moramo, da ga ne dopuščamo\".\n\nV sklopu protesta se bodo zvrstili govori predstavnikov različnih organizacij, ki se borijo proti spolnemu nasilju in diskriminaciji, kot so SOS telefon, Inštitut 8. marec, Ženska svetovalnica in sindikat Mladi plus. Poleg tega bodo na shodu nastopile tudi slovenske umetnice, med njimi Simona Semenič, dramatičarka, in Barbara Rehar, glasbenica. Uprizorjen bo tudi prizor iz knjige Katje Gorečan, Trpljenje mlade Hane, v režiji Aljaža Primožiča.\n\nV DOFEM sporočajo, da imajo dovolj tega, da \"nasilje nad ženskami obsojamo le na načelni ravni, ko pa pride do konkretnih primerov, vedno znova ugotavljamo, da državne institucije nimajo primernih vzvodov in načinov za soočanje s primeri (spolnega) nasilja\". Kot primer navajajo t. i. afero Merc ter primere spolnega nadlegovanja, v katere sta bila vpletena rektor Univerze na Primorskem, Dragan Marušič, in Igor Tičar, bivši rektor Univerze v Mariboru. Še posebej izpostavljajo razsodbo koprskega sodišča, ki v primeru posilstva speče žrtve tega sploh ni prepoznala.\n\nV opis dogodka na Facebooku so zapisali, da se \"nasilje nad ženskami izvaja v različnih oblikah - med drugim kot ekonomsko, fizično, psihično, spolno nasilje. Vsako ima svoje posebne značilnosti in manifestacije, večinoma pa jim je skupna moška dominacija\". Pravijo, da zaradi zaostritve političnih in ekonomskih razmer, med njimi so izpostavljene višje najemnine in nižje plače, ki so lahko vzrok za odvisnost žrtev nasilja od nasilnega partnerja, opažajo porast vseh oblik nasilja. \n\nV odboru se zavedajo in opozarjajo na dejstvo, da se na žalost v javnosti pojavljajo le najbolj odmevni primeri, preveč pa je še takih, ki ostajajo za zaprtimi vrati in med štirimi stenami. Poleg tega želijo na shodu opozoriti tudi na nasilje na delovnem mestu, v šolah, na intimnopartnersko nasilje in na temo, ki je v javnosti še vedno tabu, nasilje v obliki prostitucije. Spolna industrija, trdijo, deluje na ideji, kjer ženske postanejo blago, namenjeno prodaji na trgu.\n\n\"Z gibanjem #Metoo, slovensko #JazTudi, so ženske po vsem svetu spregovorile o posamičnih primerih spolnega nasilja, ki jih je tako veliko, da sistemske narave nasilja nad ženskami ne moremo več zatajiti,\" dodajajo. Zato zahtevajo družbene in sistemske spremembe, med katerimi izpostavljajo še bolj radikalno definicijo posilstva, kot se je pojavljala v javnosti, model \"da pomeni da\", kjer samo izrecno izrečeno soglasje ne pomeni spolnega napada. \"Moramo vedeti, da je spolnost kot taka zelo družbeno oblikovana, moški in ženske imamo družbeno zelo jasno predpisane vloge tudi v spolnosti. V medijih in popularni kulturi nasploh je ženskam vedno predpisana pasivna vloga v spolnosti, po navadi naj bi bile plen, ki ga mora moški ujeti. V taki družbi je zelo težko zahtevati od žensk, da bodo prevzele vso odgovornost za takšne podobe,\" dodaja Mojca Žerak.\n\n\"Problem nasilja nad ženskami in drugih patriarhalnih vzorcev, ki jih prepoznavamo v družbi, se tiče vseh nas, ne samo žensk. Zelo je pomembno, da tudi moški sodelujejo v procesu spreminjanja trenutne družbe v bolj odprto, vsem posameznicam in posameznikom bolj prijazno,\" sklene Mojca Žerak. \n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 0, "end": 46}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 0, "end": 46}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 70, "end": 77}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 178, "end": 258}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 233, "end": 258}, {"tag": "Red_Herring", "start": 274, "end": 355}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 277, "end": 294}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 358, "end": 457}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 387, "end": 407}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 419, "end": 457}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 461, "end": 582}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 473, "end": 539}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 512, "end": 539}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 585, "end": 630}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 659, "end": 700}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 796, "end": 824}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 827, "end": 920}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 838, "end": 859}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 903, "end": 920}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 991, "end": 1085}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1411, "end": 1480}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1483, "end": 1554}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1506, "end": 1554}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 1578, "end": 1627}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1767, "end": 1842}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1901, "end": 2157}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2160, "end": 2250}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2263, "end": 2343}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2265, "end": 2288}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2293, "end": 2321}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2554, "end": 2679}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 2583, "end": 2679}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2681, "end": 3098}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 3210, "end": 3225}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 3302, "end": 3423}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 3344, "end": 3423}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3426, "end": 3618}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3621, "end": 3734}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 3830, "end": 3981}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4049, "end": 4055}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4060, "end": 4070}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 4132, "end": 4249}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 4532, "end": 4686}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4875, "end": 4892}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4984, "end": 5111}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 5143, "end": 5238}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 5417, "end": 5577}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5896, "end": 5911}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 6016, "end": 6092}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 6221, "end": 6332}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 6336, "end": 6441}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 6336, "end": 6402}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6502, "end": 6575}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6538, "end": 6547}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 6578, "end": 6766}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 6814, "end": 6853}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6824, "end": 6831}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6845, "end": 6853}], "article_id": "4443", "lang": "sl", "text": "Oče naš, ki si tuzemski, prosimo te, odreši nas\n\nOdkar nam je tretjič zavladal in razglasil epidemijo, lahko v tem, da nam vlada on in nihče drug, zdaj končno vidimo priložnost. Zdaj ima Janez Janša priložnost nase resnično prevzeti breme narodovega odrešenja. Čisto zares, tu zgodbice za otroke, ki ne ločijo Pučnika od Drnovška ali Kučana, ne veljajo več. Zdaj je tu priložnost, da si nadene krono iz trnja, z njo pa narod vodi skozi križev pot bolečih rok.\n\nJanša mora, če želi postati odrešitelj Slovencev – in dobro vemo, da si to želi – uvesti obvezno cepljenje proti covidu-19. Ker pa to ni samoumevno, kaj šele priljubljeno, moramo pojasniti, zakaj.\n\nCepljenje je in mora biti večinski projekt. Ne le projekt običajne, volilne večine, ampak kar vsedržavljanski, celo vsečloveški projekt. To je cepljenje po definiciji. Vse napore »javnih« strokovnjakov, da bi bistvo projekta cepljenja zavili v šmek darilni papir, lahko zelo preprosto ekspliciramo v starem organicističnem jeziku: »Nobenega smotra ni v tem, da bi le del organizma družbe ohranili, ostalega pa pustili odmiranju. Ko celota organizma ne bo zdrava, tudi del te celote ne more biti zdrav. Del brez celote namreč ne more obstati, prav kakor celota brez vseh svojih delov ne.« To je vse, nič več in nič manj vsebine ni v projektu cepljenja.\n\nČe mora biti cepljena celota ali vsaj velika večina celote, je osrednje vprašanje, kako to doseči. Očitno se namreč ne gre zanesti na tako imenovano družbeno solidarnost, kakor zmotno imenujejo domnevno razsvetljeno zavednost obstoja sočloveka, h kateri pozivajo in ki naj bi jo začasa covida-19 celo na novo odkrili.\n\nTako je denimo sodelavec Ivan Koruza še pred slabega pol leta v rubriki, ki jo pravkar poslušate, zatrjeval, da je leto 2020 »podčrtala že dolgo nevidena stopnja medčloveške solidarnosti in družbenega žrtvovanja«. V podporo trditvi je navedel nekaj primerov, citiramo: »Od medgeneracijske solidarnosti mladih, ki so delček svoje mladosti podarili v zameno za varnost svojih starih staršev, do požrtvovalnih zdravstvenih delavcev ter do učiteljev in staršev, ki so skrbeli za to, da so otroci lahko čim bolj normalno napredovali. Nenazadnje nam mora upanje v prihodnost nazaj vliti tudi navdušenje otrok ob vrnitvi v šolo, pri čemer o pregovorni naveličanosti in letargični prisili do šolanja ni niti duha ne sluha.«\n\nObstoja empiričnih dejstev, ki jih je naštel Koruza, morda ne gre zanikati, a v njegovem argumentu nikjer ni najti premise z dokazom ali vsaj znamenjem, da so vsa ta dejanja ljudje storili iz solidarnosti. Kako lahko vemo, da nekateri velikih dejanj niso storili iz čiste nuje, saj jih je k temu zavezovala služba, od katere živijo? Kako lahko vemo, na primer, da nismo v času prvih karanten »potrpeli« iz zelo sebičnega razloga, saj smo se bali za lastno zdravje - ali zdravje lastne družine, kar je še vedno zaseben vgib - ne pa za zdravje celote družbe? Ali še preprosteje, da smo sprva mislili, kako bo po eni karateni vse minilo, izolacija v lastno zasebnost pa je bila lahka odločitev v že pred epidemijo skorajda povsem pozasebljenem življenju?\n\nVse to so špekulacije, enakovredne trditvi, da so ljudje med epidemijo vse dobro počeli zaradi solidarnosti. Gotovo pa je eno. Četudi se je solidarnost morda med prvo karanteno za kratek čas pojavila, danes kot večinska drža ljudi ne obstaja. In empiričen dokaz je dovolj samo en: cepiti se je šla le polovica odraslih oseb. »Solidarnost«, ki je ima zadnje čase polna usta predvsem minister za zdravje Janez Poklukar, pri velikem delu prebivalstva nad vsemi drugimi utemeljenimi ali neutemeljenimi razlogi ni prevagala. Prav zato, ker je cepljenje projekt, na katerega morajo pristati vsi ali skoraj vsi, »solidarnost« pri njem odpove. Pravo solidarnost so vedno aktivno udejanjali tisti na robovih ali izven družbe, ne večina.\n\nPredpostavka nekakšne »solidarnosti«, ali še bolje, »razsvetljenosti«, je v ozadju vseh poskusov civiliziranega prepričevanja ljudi, naj se gredo cepiti. Nedavno je Jernej Kaluža za Delo pojasnjeval, da polarizacija na cepilce in anticepilce za prepričevanje necepljenih ni koristna, ter položil vero »v to, da smo vsi skupaj zmožni – tudi z informiranim prepričevanjem – sprejemanja avtonomnih in racionalnih odločitev«. Seveda z argumentiranim prepričevanjem ni nič narobe, toda zaleglo bo morda pri odstotku, dveh, petih ali desetih odstotkih necepljenih. Verjetno bolje kot nič, a za uspeh projekta cepljenja ne dovolj dobro.\n\nKaluža pri zagovoru racionalne prepričevalne metode izhaja iz podmene, da so mnogi dvomi v cepiva ali razloge za cepljenje upravičeni in racionalni, zato pa jih je možno na racionalen način tudi preseči v korist skupnega cilja. Prvi problem tega je, da cepljenje očitno ni prepoznano kot skupen cilj – kakršnokoli prepričevanje tistih, ki nasprotujejo temu, da bi projekt cepljenja sploh postal skupen cilj, pa je obsojeno na propad. Ne drži namreč, kakor trdi Kaluža, da »bi skupni problem necepljenih težko detektirali«. Skupni problem, ki ne velja le za necepljene, je vgrajenost dvoma v moderno racionalnost sámo. Še več, dvom racionalnost poganja.\n\nVzrok za dvom je globlji od internetne zmešnjave informacij, ki jo mnogi krivijo za dvom v cepiva ali v razloge za cepljenje. Dvom je lasten mišljenju, ujetemu med prevarami čutov in prevarami uma, zato ga je nemogoče odpraviti, ne da bi odpravili tudi mišljenje. Toda za razliko od metodičnega dvoma, najbolj slavno izpeljanega pri Descartesu, ki je gotovost o obstoju resnice pravzaprav našel v gotovosti o obstoju dobrega, resnicoljubnega in nezmotljivega Boga, je dvom običajnega človeka brez posebne metode, ki dvom na neki točki naredi za končnega. Ker običajen dvom ne pozna pravil igre, zemljevida poti, ki bi jih moral prehoditi, da bi prišel do sklepa, z lahkoto postane absoluten. Tako denimo niti stežka ne moremo odgovoriti na vprašanje, »zakaj se cepiti?«, saj dvom, ki ne pozna meja, ne priznava niti obstoja polja izrekanja resnice, na katerem bi bilo možno iskati pravilne odgovore.\n\nEdini odgovor na ta univerzalen dvom je lahko samo uvedba obveznega cepljenja. Ne zaradi tega, da bi tiste, ki se ne želijo cepiti, prisilili v nekaj, kar je nasprotno njihovi volji, ampak preprosto zato, ker bi edino neposredna izkušnja cepljenja, otipljiv in neiznakažen dokaz, lahko kljubovala univerzalnosti dvoma.\n\nUstavnopravno uvedba obveznega cepljenja verjetno ne bi bila sporna, zato Janša izgovorov ne bi smel imeti. Še več, edino on si lahko tako potezo politično privošči, saj tako ali tako že sedaj velja za diktatorja, v mnogih ozirih upravičeno. Če oziroma ko mu bodo za uvedbo obveznega cepljenja očitali diktaturo, to zanj ne bo nič novega in nič takega, kar bi njegove volivce zmotilo. In zato je dobro, da nam prav zdaj vlada Janša, ki ima tokrat kar v lastnih rokah odločitev, ali bo iz mučenika postal tudi odrešenik.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 78, "end": 141}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 611, "end": 634}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 903, "end": 945}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 948, "end": 1142}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1035, "end": 1067}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1106, "end": 1111}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1192, "end": 1210}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1201, "end": 1210}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1519, "end": 1542}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1569, "end": 1575}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1605, "end": 1624}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1749, "end": 1757}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1870, "end": 1890}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1913, "end": 1967}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1987, "end": 2007}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2095, "end": 2114}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2179, "end": 2194}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2197, "end": 2248}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2283, "end": 2296}, {"tag": "Red_Herring", "start": 2308, "end": 2358}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2480, "end": 2498}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2751, "end": 2802}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2751, "end": 2858}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2851, "end": 2858}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3217, "end": 3223}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3241, "end": 3267}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3241, "end": 3246}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3283, "end": 3342}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 3345, "end": 3384}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 3387, "end": 3412}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3473, "end": 3479}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 3513, "end": 3528}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3609, "end": 3616}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3662, "end": 3666}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 3713, "end": 3769}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3909, "end": 3980}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3946, "end": 3962}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3946, "end": 3980}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3964, "end": 3980}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4158, "end": 4177}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4186, "end": 4200}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4202, "end": 4215}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4817, "end": 4902}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5775, "end": 5785}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5843, "end": 5865}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5939, "end": 5959}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6204, "end": 6213}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 6451, "end": 6582}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 6585, "end": 6658}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 6835, "end": 6922}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6844, "end": 6853}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6972, "end": 7045}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 7014, "end": 7034}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 7039, "end": 7045}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 7049, "end": 7326}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 7486, "end": 7580}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 7522, "end": 7540}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 7819, "end": 7841}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 7872, "end": 8133}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 7997, "end": 8026}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 8057, "end": 8133}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 8137, "end": 8891}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 8190, "end": 8244}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 8335, "end": 8409}], "article_id": "4444", "lang": "sl", "text": "Povabilo v gulag\n\n\"Dragi rojaki, vrnite se domov, dokler še imate to možnost. Dokler vas tam v Evropi ne strpajo v koncentracijska taborišča!\" S temi besedami je predsednik dume Vjačeslav Volodin v teh dneh nagovoril vse tiste ruske državljane, ki so po začetku vojne proti Ukrajini zbežali iz države. Natančnih številk o tem, koliko Rusov je iz strahu pred mobilizacijo odšlo v tujino, seveda ni, toda po nekaterih ocenah jih je gotovo najmanj milijon. K tej številki je seveda treba prišteti še nekaj milijonov tistih, ki so iz države odšli že pred tem. Ko je postalo jasno, da se je v deželo dokončno vrnila trda sovjetska diktatura.\n\nZanimivo je, da se je s tovrstno pobudo med prvimi oglasil prav Vjačeslav Volodin, ki je še nedolgo tega govoril, da je treba vsem pobeglim zapleniti premoženje, jim povišati davke, njihove avtomobile in drugo lastnino pa predati družinam oficirjev in vojakov. Pač v skladu z znano retoriko Vladimirja Putina, ki je vse tiste, ki so obrnili hrbet domovini, že kmalu po začetku vojne razglasil za \"nacpredatelje (narodne izdajalce), ki jih bo ruski narod izpljunil kot mušico, ki po naključju zaide v usta\".\n\nToda zdaj je Kremelj nekoliko omilil odnos do pobeglih izdajalcev. V tujino so namreč odšli v glavnem strokovnjaki, intelektualci, profesorji, doktorji znanosti, ki jih država nujno potrebuje. Režim še posebej pogreša tako imenovane ajtišnike (po kratici IT), torej mojstre za informacijsko tehnologijo in računalniške programerje, ki jih v Rusiji skorajda ni več. Zato so kremeljski propagandisti vse pobegle začeli resno snubiti, naj se vrnejo v domovino.\n\nPropagandni \"šedevr\"\n\nV preteklih nekaj tednih sem v Evropski uniji, pa v Armeniji in Gruziji in te dni celo v Pekingu srečal kar precej Rusov, zgroženih nad tem, kaj Kremelj počne v Ukrajini, zaradi česar se zlepa ne bodo vrnili v Putinov objem, kot pravijo. Toda kremeljska propaganda seveda meni drugače. Vrnili so se k starim, že zdavnaj preizkušenim prijemom. Kot denimo znani kremeljski \"vojenkor\" (vojni dopisnik) Aleksander Koc, ki je na svojem kanalu na Telegramu objavil \"izpoved pobeglega ajtišnika\", 35 let starega računalničarja, ki se je naveličal trpljenja v rusofobni Evropi, kjer je malo dela in kjer je treba vse drago plačati. Zato se je odločil za vrnitev v ljubo domovino, kjer je \"življenje lepo, poceni, saj je skorajda vse zastonj, in kjer oblast lahko celo kritiziraš\".\n\nAjtišnika brez objavljenega imena je k tej odločitvi, kot piše Koc, spodbudila pretresljiva zgodba ruskega vojaka Viktorja, ki je na fronti kljub hudim ranam, kasneje so mu odrezali nogo, pomagal ranjenim tovarišem in jih sredi strašnega obstreljevanja z ukrajinske strani spravil na varno. A tudi o tej zgodbo mnogi resno dvomijo, ali je resnična.\n\nTisti, ki dobro poznajo tovrstne propagandne prijeme, so to Kocevo zgodbo razglasili za propagandni \"šedevr\" (po ruski fonetični pisavi francoske besede chef-d'œuvre, kar pomeni mojstrovina) brez primere. Nekateri so brž pobrskali po starih sovjetskih arhivih in našli pismo, ki ga je v letih pred perestrojko objavila Pravda, takratno glasilo sovjetske partije.\n\nPismo z naslovom Hočem domov! gre takole: \"Spoštovano uredništvo Pravde! Pomagajte mi! Rešite me pred gibeljo. Rešite me tega črnega ameriškega življenja. Hočem domov, kjer sem se rodila, rasla, se učila in kjer sem končala šolo. Ljubim svoje mesto Kijev, svojo domovino. Hočem, hočem, hočem domov!\n\nStara sem osemnajst let. Starši, ki so odšli v ZDA, so me na silo odvlekli s seboj. Tu sem videla veliko strašnega. Strah me je. Tu sem spoznala, kaj je brezposelnost. In zdaj jočem dan in noč. Sovražim starše, ker so me pripeljali sem. Le kakšni norci prihajajo sem v Ameriko? Kaj so tu pozabili? Ni boljšega življenja, kot je življenje v Sovjetski zvezi. Vse bi storila, da se lahko vrnem domov!\" Pismo je podpisano s kratico A. D. Poslano naj bi bilo iz San Francisca.\n\nVzhod, Zahod\n\nTisti, ki bodo morda res nasedli zdajšnjemu zapeljivemu petju kremeljskih siren, si morajo pred vrnitvijo v Rusijo nujno ogledati sijajni francosko-ruski film Vzhod, Zahod, posnet leta 1999. Ko sem ga takrat gledal v Moskvi, te v želodcu kar stisne zaradi pokvarjenosti režima, ki ga boleče razgalja ta mojstrovina. Film, ki je takrat pobral vse francoske filmske nagrade in bil tudi francoski kandidat za oskarja, danes zanesljivo ne bi bil več na ogled v ruskih kinodvoranah.\n\nZgodba je po svoje zelo podobna zdajšnjemu dogajanju. Stalin je leta 1946, takoj po končani vojni, domov povabil vse, zlasti belo rusko buržoazijo, ki je po oktobrski revoluciji zbežala iz države. Mnogi so res verjeli kremeljskim obljubam. Na ladji, ki je iz Francije plula proti Črnemu morju, se je seveda jedlo, pilo, plesalo in veseljačilo, toda ko je ladja pristala v Odesi, v hipu nastopi streznitev. Kruta realnost iz nočnih mor. Polovico potnikov so namreč takoj odpeljali na streljanje, druge pa so poslali v gulag.\n\nRuskega zdravnika Alekseja Golovina, ki ga je režim seveda nujno potreboval (sijajno ga igra Oleg Menšikov), s francosko ženo Marie (Sandrine Bonnaire) in sinom Serjožo pošljejo v Kijev. V komunalko, kjer se v bistvu začne pravo trpljenje. Marie obtožijo, da je vohunka, Aleksej pa poskuša storiti vse, da bi družina preživela in se nekako vrnila v Francijo. To mu veliko kasneje uspe s pomočjo francoske igralke Gabrielle (igra jo velika Catherine Deneuve), ki je zdravnikovo ženo in sina po pravi drami le spravila čez mejo na Zahod. Alekseja seveda takoj aretirajo in ga pošljejo v gulag na Sahalin, kjer so mu na srečo dovolili opravljati zdravniško poslanstvo. Družino je znova videl šele leta 1987, ko se je v Sovjetski zvezi že začela perestrojka.\n\nVrnitev in detektor laži\n\nVladimir Putin je na nedavnem peterburškem ekonomskem forumu dejal, da se je polovica \"relokantov\", kot zdaj pravijo pobeglim Rusom, že vrnila v domovino. Kar je seveda čista laž. Zanimivo je namreč, da raziskave javnega mnenja, ki jih redno objavlja kremeljska propaganda, niso naklonjene vračanju pobeglih. Po eni od njih je proti kar 54 odstotkov vprašanih. Slaba četrtina opozarja, da se smejo vrniti samo tisti, ki niso pljuvali po državi in ruski vojski, precej pa je tudi takšnih, ki zahtevajo, da morajo vsi \"skesanci\" po vrnitvi najprej čez detektor laži, kjer bo treba odgovarjati na vprašanja: Čigav je Krim? Čigavi so Donbas, Herson, Zaporožje ...?\n\nVjačeslav Volodin se je v svojem \"vabilu\", naj se vrnejo, dokler ne bo prepozno, skliceval na besede češkega predsednika Petra Pavla, ki je v enem od nastopov posvaril, da bo treba skrbneje oprezati za Rusi, ki so se zatekli v Evropo. Podobno, kot so z ameriškimi Japonci med drugo svetovno vojno počeli v ZDA. Toda Peter Pavel v tem svojem govoru nikoli ni omenjal koncentracijskih taborišč za Ruse, o katerih je govoril Volodin. Prej bi veljalo nasprotno. Kaj lahko se namreč zgodi, da bodo \"relokanti\", ki se bodo odločili za vrnitev, končali v kakšnih Putinovih gulagih. Ali pa v precej izpraznjenih zaporih, od koder so na fronto v Ukrajino pošiljali najbolj zakrknjene kriminalce in morilce.\n\nVjačeslav Volodin zato v svoji prijaznosti do rojakov na tujem v mnogočem spominja na heroja stare sovjetske anekdote, ki med obiskom pri psihoterapevtu pravi: \"Doktor, jaz sploh nimam več prijateljev. Bi mi ti odurni plešasti starec morda lahko pomagal, da pridem do kakšnega?\"\nPutin v Haag, Medvedjev v bolnišnico\n\nKiril Martinov, urednik Nove Gazete. Evropa, ki izhaja v Rigi, je na Volodinovo vabilo rojakom, naj se vrnejo v Rusijo, dokler jih dokončno ne odplakne val evropske rusofobije in dokler sploh še imajo takšno možnost, odgovoril s peticijo v več točkah. Ker so ruski državljani, ki so zaradi sile razmer odšli v tujino, globoko zaskrbljeni nad tem, kar se dogaja v državi, bo vrnitev domov, kamor si seveda vsi želijo, kot piše, mogoča šele takrat, ko bo kremeljska nomenklatura izpolnila naslednje pogoje:\n\n- Vse ruske vojaške enote se morajo pri priči umakniti z mednarodno priznanega ozemlja Ukrajine.\n\n- Prepovedati je treba vse nezakonite oborožene formacije, kot je na primer Wagner.\n\n- Osvoboditi je treba vse politične zapornike in ukiniti diskriminatorne zakone.\n\n- Razpustiti je treba državno dumo Ruske federacije, ki je postala shajališče za državo nevarnih samozvancev.\n\n- Predsednik dume Vjačeslav Volodin se mora osebno opravičiti vsem državljanom Rusije, ki jih je razglasil za izdajalce in jim grozil z eksekucijo na Lobnem mestu. (Gre za del Rdečega trga, kjer so nekoč sekali glave obsojencem.)\n\n- Kot zgodovinsko potezo dobre volje je treba čim prej organizirati obisk Vladimirja Putina na Mednarodnem kazenskem sodišču v Haagu, kjer se mu ne bo zgodilo nič hudega.

Delegati so kljub nasprotovanju potrdili vladne načrte o rabi premoga, na kar se je ostro odzvala celo švedskaaktivistka Greta Thunberg, ki je za ARD povedala, da je bilo zapiranje delujočih jedrskih elektrarn “napaka”.\n\nNemška vlada je že tako radikalno leva, da se je celo podnebna aktivistka Greta Thunberg distancirala od njih. Njihovo zapiranje že delujočih jedrskih elektrarn je označila za napako, saj s kurjenjem premoga povzročajo še več podnebne škode. Prav nobenega racionalnega razloga ni za odklop jedrskih elektrarn. Niti v običajnih časih, kaj šele zdaj, ko preživljamo globalno energetsko krizo.\n\nZeleni so se morali v preteklih mesecih kljub uspehu na lanskih parlamentarnih volitvah soočiti z nekaterimi bolečimi vprašanji in kompromisi zlasti v luči vojne v Ukrajini in energetske krize. Med drugim tudi o možnosti podaljšanja delovanja še zadnjih treh nemških nukleark, kjer kritike letijo predvsem na ministra za gospodarstvo iz vrst Zelenih Roberta Habecka. Ta je namreč predlagal podaljšanje delovanja dveh nukleark, čemur so kljubovali v stranki Zeleni, njegov predlog pa so podprli delegati. Na zadnji dan kongresa v Bonnu pa so s tesno večino pritrdili tudi vladnim načrtom o rabi premoga.\n\nZakone bi bilo namreč treba spremeniti, da bi jedrske elektrarne ostale v omrežju tudi po letu 2022, vendar je koalicijska vlada, ki jo sestavljajo SPD, Zelena stranka in FDP, pustila, da rok za odločitev, načrtovan za 10. oktober, propade, so sporočili z gospodarskega ministrstva in po poročanju AFP dodali, da omenjena zamuda predstavlja težavo, če želijo, da Isar 2 leta 2023 še vedno proizvaja elektriko. Obrat potrebuje nujna popravila za podaljšanje delovanja. Morebitno podaljšanje obratovalnega časa, ki ga je predlagal minister za gospodarstvo Robert Habeck, je namenjeno temu, da bi jedrski elektrarni Isar 2 v južni zvezni državi Bavarska in Neckarwestheim 2 v sosednji Baden-Wurttembergu še naprej delovali “v zasilni rezervi” do 15. aprila 2023. V skladu z veljavno zakonodajo bodo vse jedrske elektrarne zaprte konec leta 2022 in nato razgrajene. Zaradi političnih nesoglasij v vladnih koalicijskih partnerjih ni bil sprejet noben osnutek zakona, razlog za zamudo pa je predvsem spor med Zelenimi in FDP, piše Tagesspiegel. FDP namreč zahteva, da se jedrskim elektrarnam zaradi trenutne energetske krize dovoli znatno daljše obratovanje.\n\nZeleni zavračajo smiselne rešitve\n\nPredlog, da dve jedrski elektrarni ostaneta pripravljeni do pomladi prihodnje leto, je prišel po “stresnem testu”, ki je nakazal, da bi lahko bilo omejeno podaljšanje obratovalnega časa smiselno v trenutnih okoliščinah, povezanih z energetsko krizo. Vendar FDP pravi, da bi moralo biti podaljšanje jedrskega časa daljše od predlaganega in da bi bilo treba razmisliti o ponovnem zagonu že zaprtih reaktorjev, medtem ko Zeleni odločno zavračajo obe zamisli. Vladni svetovalci so Nemčijo pozvali k uporabi jedrske energije do konca energetske krize, okoljevarstvene skupine pa so kritizirale odločitev, da elektrarne ostanejo v rezervi. Upravljavci jedrskih elektrarn so pristali na podaljšanje delovanja do leta 2023.\n\nDogovor med zveznim ministrstvom za gospodarstvo, deželno vlado Severnega Porenja-Vestfalije in energetskim velikanom RWE namreč predvideva tudi obratovanje dveh elektrarn na rjavi premog še do konca leta 2024 ter sporno uničenje vasi Lützerath, nekakšnega simbola boja proti podnebnim spremembam, ker leži na nahajališču premoga. Nemški Deutsche Welle je na podlagi te odločitve ocenil, da je bil tokratni kongres Zelenih “osupljivo nespektakularen”, saj da se je na njem večina dramatično po tihem in nekonfliktno odpovedala stališčem, ki so bila desetletja del politične DNK stranke.\n\nOdločitve o zapiranju jedrskih elektrarn kritizirala tudi Thunbergova\n\nPodnebna aktivistka Greta Thunberg se je na dogajanje v Nemčiji prav tako odzvala in obsodila odločitev o zapiranju jedrskih elektrarn in kurjenju na premog, ki bo podnebju povzročil še več škode kot že delujoče jedrske elektrarne. Thunbergova, ki je navdihnila mladinsko podnebno gibanje s svojimi samostojnimi protesti pred švedskim parlamentom leta 2018, je za nemško javno radiotelevizijo ARD povedala, da je “zelo slaba ideja osredotočati se na premog, ko že imajo delujoče jedrske elektrarne”.\n\nVodilo Zelenih temelj “nori zeleni ideologiji in nadzoru“\n\nZa lažje razumevanje pogled stranke Zelenih lahko povzamemo besede Ruperta Darwalla, višjega sodelavca pri RealClearFoundation, ki raziskuje vprašanja od mednarodnih podnebnih sporazumov do vključevanja okoljskih, družbenih in upravljavskih ciljev (ESG) v korporativno upravljanje. Ta je pojasnil, da je bila prva politična stranka, ki je imela program obnovljive energije, nacistična stranka na volitvah v Reichstag leta 1933. Njihov cilj je bil prehod na vetrno energijo in uporabo vetra za proizvodnjo vodika. Katalizator te energetske revolucije v nacistični stranki je bila miselnost “mi proti njim” in je bila temeljna reakcija proti “izvirnemu grehu industrijske revolucije” – revolucije, ki je bistveno zvišala življenjski standard človeštva in jo je omogočil premog, je Darwall v intervjuju povedal Paulu Greaneyju iz NTD, sestrskega medija The Epoch Times. Toda ko je nacistična stranka padla, so morali nacistični in neonacistični okoljski voditelji najti nove načine nadaljevanja svoje “energetske revolucije”. Tako so prevzeli vodilne položaje v nastajajoči okoljevarstveni stranki v Nemčiji in se pridružili protestom proti jedrski energiji med hladno vojno. Ta stranka je pozneje leta 1980 uradno postala nemška Zelena stranka, kar je privedlo do “ozelenitve Nemčije“, morebitne “ozelenitve Evrope”, ki pa ne temelji na znanosti, ampak na “nori zeleni ideologiji in nadzoru“, še trdi Darwall.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 36, "end": 52}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 55, "end": 66}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 56, "end": 119}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 228, "end": 310}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 327, "end": 384}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 394, "end": 469}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 472, "end": 651}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 825, "end": 941}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1491, "end": 1531}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1536, "end": 1581}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1536, "end": 1547}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1550, "end": 1581}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1887, "end": 1962}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1887, "end": 1962}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1979, "end": 2110}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2060, "end": 2073}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2245, "end": 2264}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2423, "end": 2565}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2513, "end": 2533}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 2723, "end": 2804}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3187, "end": 3200}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3691, "end": 3768}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3703, "end": 3713}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3733, "end": 3768}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 4336, "end": 4397}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5948, "end": 5989}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6255, "end": 6366}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6402, "end": 6610}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 6560, "end": 6610}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 7129, "end": 7234}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 7237, "end": 7341}], "article_id": "4446", "lang": "sl", "text": "Se Volodimir Zelenski pripravlja na drastično potezo?\n\nPonastavitev na številnih področjih v državi je vsekakor potrebna, je v intervjuju za italijanski medij Rai News v nedeljo izjavil ukrajinski predsednik Volodimir Zelenski, ki naj bi bil že dalj časa v sporu z vrhovnim poveljnikom vojske Valerijem Zalužnim.

Končno odločitev o njegovi kandidaturi naj bi komisija objavila v sredo, Nadeždin pa je danes sporočil, da je odločen pridobiti potrebne podpise.\n\nPo besedah Nadeždina je delovna skupina ruske osrednje volilne komisije zaradi domnevnih nepravilnosti zavrnila več kot 15 odstotkov podpisov, ki jih je predložil v podporo svoji kandidaturi, poroča francoska tiskovna agencija AFP.

V Kijevu so sicer poziv k odstopu zanikali.\n\nPo oceni ukrajinskega predsednika bi bilo treba v državi zamenjati \"celotno vodstvo, ki poganja državni stroj\". Kot je dejal, morajo biti namreč vsi vodilni v državi prepričani o zmagi Ukrajine v boju proti ruski agresiji in v luči tega delovati v isti smeri, poroča nemška tiskovna agencija dpa.\n\nZalužni, ki je v vlogi vrhovnega poveljnika ukrajinskih sil od leta 2021, med Ukrajinci sicer uživa veliko podporo.

Do napada je prišlo po sobotnem napadu na Lisičansk, ki so ga ruske oblasti pripisale ukrajinski vojski. Kremelj je obsodil napad, ki naj bi zahteval 28 življenj, med njimi tudi ministra proruske vlade.\n\nV današnjem napadu na središče Hersona so bili ubiti trije moški, ki so bili v avtomobilu, in ženska, ki je bila v času napada na ulici, je na Telegramu sporočil vodja vojaške uprave Hersona Roman Mročko. Svojo objavo je pospremil z videoposnetkom, ki prikazuje zoglenel avtomobil in nekaj metrov stran majhen krater na tleh, ki nakazuje na udarec, poroča francoska tiskovna agencija AFP.\n\nV napadu je bil ranjen še en moški, ki se trenutno zdravi v bolnišnici, je še sporočil Mročko in obsodil nov ruski napad v Hersonu zaradi \"ubijanja in poškodovanja civilistov\".\n\n11.42 V Ukrajino dostavljen F-16 z raketami dosega od tristo do petsto kilometrov \n\nF-16 z raketami dosega od tristo do petsto kilometrov naj bi bili dostavljeni v Ukrajino, je dejal poveljnik Združenih sil Ukrajine, generalpodpolkovnik Serhij Najev. \n\n8.37 V največje evropsko jezero strmoglavil helikopter ruskega obrambnega ministrstva \n\nHelikopter Mi-8 ruskega obrambnega ministrstva s tremi člani posadke je strmoglavil v jezero v Severni Kareliji, je danes sporočilo ministrstvo in dodalo, da poteka podvodno iskanje.\n\n\"Helikopter je bil na vadbenem poletu, upravljala pa ga je izkušena posadka z več tisoč urami letenja,\" je ministrstvo sporočilo v aplikaciji za sporočanje Telegram. \n\nRazbitine helikopterja, ki je v nedeljo pozno izginil z radarjev, so našli enajst kilometrov od obale Onegaškega jezera, drugega največjega jezera v Evropi, v Kareliji, na globini petdeset metrov.\n\nZ ministrstva so sporočili, da pri iskanju sodelujejo potapljači in podvodno vozilo na daljinsko vodenje.

Predsednik ZDA Joe Biden je dogovor že pozdravil, vendar pa podpora v predstavniškem domu kongresa po poročanju ameriških medijev ni zagotovljena.\n\nPredlog so pripravili republikanski senator James Lankford, demokrat Chrish Murphy in neodvisna senatorka Kyrsten Sinema, objavila pa ga je predsednica senatnega odbora za razdeljevanje proračunskih sredstev, demokratka Patty Murray.\n\nGre za predlog zakona o dodatni proračunski porabi, za katerega je predsednik Biden v delu, ki zadeva 60 milijard dolarjev pomoči Ukrajini, zaprosil že pred štirimi meseci.\n\nRepublikanci so potrditev pogojevali z zaostritvijo zakonodaje glede migracij oziroma varnosti na južni meji, v kar je Biden skupaj z demokrati privolil.\n\nSenat naj bi predlog potrdil že v prihodnjem tednu, vendar pa republikanska večina v predstavniškem domu še ni prepričana.\n\nBivši predsednik ZDA Donald Trump namreč republikance poziva, naj kompromisa ne sprejmejo, ker noče, da ZDA še naprej podpirajo Ukrajino, neurejen položaj na meji pa mu ustreza za pridobivanje podpore volivcev pred letošnjimi predsedniškimi volitvami.\n\nPredsednik predstavniškega doma Mike Johnson je v nedeljo na televiziji NBC krivdo za zastoj valil na Bidna in demokrate, čeprav tudi nekateri republikanci v predstavniškem domu zatrjujejo, da je predlog največ, kar lahko dobijo, in je dober. Vendar pa je od Johnsona, ki je priznal, da o tem redno govori s Trumpom, odvisno, ali bodo o predlogu v predstavniškem domu sploh glasovali.\n\nPoleg 60 milijard dolarjev za Ukrajino je v predlogu 14 milijard za Izrael in deset milijard za humanitarne potrebe v Gazi, na Zahodnem bregu, v Ukrajini in drugje po svetu. Nekaj več kot štiri milijarde dolarjev pa je predvidenih za Tajvan oziroma za \"podporo partnerjem v Indo-pacifiški regiji\", poroča ameriška televizija ABC.\n\nGlede meje dogovor med drugim predvideva, da jo mora vlada zapreti, če v tednu dni naštejejo povprečno štiri tisoč nezakonitih prestopov meje na dan. Biden se s tem strinja. Predlog prav tako uvaja strožje ukrepe proti migrantom, ki želijo zavetišče v ZDA. Pospešili bi se postopki za izgon iz ZDA, mejna služba pa bi dobila več denarja za učinkovitejše delo.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Slogans", "start": 0, "end": 25}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 0, "end": 5}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 28, "end": 285}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 34, "end": 39}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 226, "end": 285}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 268, "end": 285}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 365, "end": 371}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 463, "end": 593}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 754, "end": 763}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 754, "end": 865}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1202, "end": 1356}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1597, "end": 1761}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1633, "end": 1644}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1911, "end": 2039}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1923, "end": 1927}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2052, "end": 2056}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2068, "end": 2201}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2204, "end": 2255}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2231, "end": 2255}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2258, "end": 2381}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2330, "end": 2336}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2375, "end": 2381}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2384, "end": 2549}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2450, "end": 2456}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2558, "end": 2565}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2690, "end": 2697}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2733, "end": 2752}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2767, "end": 2791}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2795, "end": 3013}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 3131, "end": 3229}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 3232, "end": 3484}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3487, "end": 3595}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3564, "end": 3595}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3599, "end": 4008}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3625, "end": 3644}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4032, "end": 4039}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4106, "end": 4113}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4211, "end": 4218}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4225, "end": 4231}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4256, "end": 4262}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4280, "end": 4288}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4364, "end": 4370}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4439, "end": 4453}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4456, "end": 4484}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4534, "end": 4573}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4583, "end": 4587}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4783, "end": 4790}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4812, "end": 4818}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4895, "end": 4904}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5047, "end": 5059}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5065, "end": 5155}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5083, "end": 5093}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 5158, "end": 5240}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5230, "end": 5240}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5287, "end": 5294}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5309, "end": 5314}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5373, "end": 5390}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5864, "end": 5968}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5971, "end": 6023}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5999, "end": 6010}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6015, "end": 6023}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6061, "end": 6177}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6083, "end": 6101}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6122, "end": 6137}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6299, "end": 6328}], "article_id": "4447", "lang": "sl", "text": "Krvavo zelena je nova črna\n\nSmo v srčiki vročega poletja, ki se je začelo s pojavom vročinske kupole nad severno Ameriko in množičnimi poplavami po Evropi, nadaljevalo pa s katastrofalnimi požari in uresničitvijo napovedi, da človeku zmanjkuje časa za ukrepanje proti popolni apokalipsi. Premislimo o dosedanji vodilni retoriki, ki je spremljala takšne in drugačne grožnje.  \n\nOb jasnih okoljskih spremembah in glasnih opozorilih znanstvenikov vladajočemu sloju, lastnikom produkcijskih sredstev in njihovim zaveznikom v vladah po svetu ni ostalo drugega, kot da poskušajo spremeniti svoj imidž. Trend je, da se veliki onesnaževalci, kakršna sta naftni podjetji Shell in BP, javno zavezujejo k zeleni politiki in zmanjšanju izpustov toplogrednih plinov. Absurdnost tega je očitna, kar pa ne pomeni, da takšne najave v politiki niso dobro sprejete ali celo pohvaljene.\n\nParadigmatski model takšnega početja, ki ga bomo uporabili, nam je blizu; gre namreč za cementarno Salonit Anhovo. Maja je družba praznovala svojo stoto obletnico delovanja, ob tej priložnosti pa naznanila, da načrtuje zeleni prehod in da bo do leta 2025 uvedla rešitve, ki bodo vodile do 15-odstotnega zmanjšanja ogljičnega odtisa. Član uprave Dejan Zwitter je na novinarski konferenci takole povzel vrednote podjetja: »Kot odgovoren gospodarski subjekt stremimo k pragmatičnemu napredku. Ne živimo v preteklosti, niti ne želimo slediti utopijam, ampak verjamemo v uspešno postopno prilagajanje s skrbno načrtovanimi in izvedljivimi koraki.« \n\nKako je lahko tako imenovano »pragmatično postopno prilagajanje« popolnoma zaupano podjetju, ki je v preteklosti ljudi zastrupljajo z azbestom, trenutno pa je zaradi sežiga odpadkov odgovorno za močno onesnažena zrak in vodo v srednji Soški dolini? Ob tem je imelo lani 11 milijonov čistega dobička, predlani pa zgodovinsko visokih 15 milijonov. To je torej zelo uspešno, dobičkonosno podjetje in vsekakor je čudno, da se takšni cementarni dajejo proste roke pri moralnem odločanju, ki bo vplivalo na življenje širše skupnosti. \n\nŠe bolj čudno pa je, da piar cementarne, ki pri svojem delovanju sežiga odpadke, pri čemer v zrak uhaja več škodljivih snovi, med katerimi je tudi živo srebro, uporablja enake besede kot liberalni politični krogi. Ponašajo se s svojim treznim, pragmatičnim pristopom, ki naj bi sčasoma odrešil človeštvo, in vse ostalo označijo za utopijo. Vse, kar ni del trenutne družbene realnosti, se obvezno označi za utopijo, zaradi česar je beseda postala praktično brezpomenska in znak pomanjkanja pravih argumentov. Če je utopično nekaj, kar v stvarnosti ni mogoče, lahko z lahkoto trdimo, da je nadaljnji obstoj trenutnega sistema tisti, ki je resnično utopičen. V trenutni situaciji je treba za fanatike in utopiste oklicati vse promotorje neoliberalizma – oni so tisti, ki živijo v iluziji in za izgovor uporabljajo abstraktne ekonomske enačbe, ki jih slehernik s težavo razume in naj bi jih sprejel kot dogmatične, ne glede na to, da uničujejo njega in naravo, v kateri živi. \n\nGlede na nedavno izdano poročilo IPPC se bo Zemlja v približno dveh desetletjih segrela za 1,5 stopinje Celzija. Če ne bomo zmanjšali izpustov toplogrednih plinov, naraščanja temperature ne bo več mogoče zajeziti. Na svetu je preostalo 35 odstotkov divjine, svetovni deževni gozd se je skrčil za polovico, število žuželk se je v zadnjih tridesetih letih globalno zmanjšalo za četrtino, populacijo rečnih živali pa smo globalno zmanjšali za več kot osemdeset odstotkov. Zagovarjanje obstoja ustroja, ki je vse to povzročil oziroma še povzroča, je utopično, nevarno in samomorilno.\n\nPovsem v skladu s tem, da veliki onesnaževalci svobodno izbirajo svoje korake, je pridiganje o individualni odgovornosti do okolja, o tem, kako lahko čisto vsak kaj malega prispeva, če le ne kupi plastične slamice. Medtem pa je bilo glede na poročilo iz leta 2017, ki ga je opravila neprofitna organizacija CDP, od leta 1988 za več kot sedemdeset odstotkov izpustov toplogrednih plinov krivih samo sto podjetij. Prepoznani so očitni zlobneži, vendar se s težavo vzpostavi močna alternativna pripoved, ki bi zlobneže v slogu klasičnega hollywoodskega filma prikazala kot take. Take, ki jih je za preživetje nujno poraziti, ker grozijo tebi in tvoji družini. Ekstaza množic ob padcu hudobneža je zagotovljena, če imaš dober scenarij. Argument, da ljudje ne verjamejo grožnji ali da jim je vseeno, je prikladen, ker krivdo ponovno prelaga na »neumne množice«. Vse vrste liberalnih mislecev morajo nehati podcenjevati ljudi, ki prepoznajo njihovo vzvišenost in prazno govoričenje v slogu piara o zelenem prehodu. Namesto tega sta potrebni iskrenost in resnična skrb, v luči katerih bi se izrisalo dobro nasproti teme. Takšni etično-politični liniji bi lahko ljudje miselno sledili, zanjo navijali in ob zmagi dosegli katarzo, olajšanje, česar vsekakor niso vajeni, kajti naučili so se biti na strani poražencev. \n\nSlovenski referendum o zakonu o vodi je pokazal, da je lahko civilna družba na področju okoljevarstva razmeroma uspešno sporočila, kdo je »the bad guy«, ki želi zaradi svoje pohlepnosti uničiti lepoto in dobroto narave, ki človeku omogoča blaginjo. Glavni slovenski ponos so naravne lepote, iz katerih izvira najčistejši patriotizem – zakaj ne bi tega izkoristil in se v boju s pošastmi postavil kot junak? Politične stranke na levi strani spektra, pri katerih je radikalnejša misel neobstoječa, bi lahko svoj politični interes za takšno početje poiskale v odzivu, ki ga je imel referendum, katerega vprašanje je uspelo ostati razmeroma nepolitično. \n\nReševanje in ohranjanje narave idealno nista politična; pri tem ne bi smelo biti pretiranih razdvajanj. Seveda je pri glasovanju ostra delitev nastala na podlagi podpore vladi s stranko SDS na čelu, vendar ni bilo klasičnega prerekanja med podporniki različnih drugih strank po vsem političnem spektru. Vse strategije, ki govorijo o doseganju ciljev čez deset let ali v letu 2050, za ljudi pomenijo bolj malo. Pokazati je treba takojšnjo neizprosnost do zlikovcev, kar bi dvignilo moralo in pokazalo resnost, ki je veliki ljubitelji Julijcev – od Tanje Fajon z mavrično zastavo do Janeza Janše s slovensko – ne kažejo. Pri tem bi se lahko morda oblikovala celo kolektivna povezanost, ki v epidemičnem izrednem stanju, v katerem se kažejo utrinki prihajajočih katastrof, ne obstaja. S kolektivno zavestjo pa so omogočene in legitimirane resnejše sistemske spremembe. \n\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 164, "end": 181}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 224, "end": 231}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 372, "end": 502}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 381, "end": 419}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 505, "end": 603}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 534, "end": 603}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 606, "end": 880}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 770, "end": 778}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 781, "end": 801}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 883, "end": 1054}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 913, "end": 917}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1293, "end": 1322}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1546, "end": 1592}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1595, "end": 1632}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1595, "end": 1778}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1781, "end": 1834}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1830, "end": 1834}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1901, "end": 1970}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1973, "end": 2135}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 2037, "end": 2135}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2137, "end": 2262}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2161, "end": 2166}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2374, "end": 2494}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2461, "end": 2494}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 2498, "end": 2627}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2501, "end": 2517}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 2879, "end": 2998}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3066, "end": 3174}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 3177, "end": 3390}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3301, "end": 3493}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 3393, "end": 3493}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 3497, "end": 3721}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 3724, "end": 3830}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3777, "end": 3800}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3833, "end": 3926}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3908, "end": 3926}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3991, "end": 3999}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 4082, "end": 4171}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4101, "end": 4115}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 4174, "end": 4315}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4219, "end": 4244}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4318, "end": 4496}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4381, "end": 4399}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 4500, "end": 4547}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4542, "end": 4547}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 4550, "end": 4729}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4550, "end": 4620}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4595, "end": 4605}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4698, "end": 4707}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4758, "end": 4765}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4777, "end": 5024}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 5158, "end": 5200}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5169, "end": 5186}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5225, "end": 5233}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5245, "end": 5512}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5484, "end": 5510}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5514, "end": 5692}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 5589, "end": 5603}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5724, "end": 5733}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5736, "end": 5996}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5893, "end": 5915}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5998, "end": 6082}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6024, "end": 6032}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 6178, "end": 6262}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6237, "end": 6262}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6265, "end": 6314}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6379, "end": 6456}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6379, "end": 6402}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6408, "end": 6425}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 6458, "end": 6539}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6630, "end": 6646}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6649, "end": 6709}], "article_id": "4448", "lang": "sl", "text": "Zaprta odprta Evropa\n\nVelik del tujcev, ki te dni pomagajo pri obnovi poplavljenih območij, je v deportacijskih postopkih in bodo težko ostali v državi, čeprav jih krvavo potrebujemo na deloviščih\n\nOdkar je Velika Britanija neslavno zapustila Evropsko unijo, v domačih medijih ne zasledimo več kaj dosti o njej. A če si vzamemo čas, iz aktualnih novic hitro razberemo, da projekt »varovanja britanskega načina življenja« po izstopu iz EU ne poteka nič kaj uspešneje, kot je pred vzpostavitvijo trde meje. Guardian je ta teden poročal o velikih težavah, ki jih ima torijska oblast pri upravljanju migracij. Britanci so, da bi svetu signalizirali svojo novopridobljeno zaprtost, preskusili vse skrajnejše ukrepe za preprečitev izkrcanja migrantov na njihovo ozemlje, tudi zloglasni »plavajoči azilni dom«: barko Bibby Stockholm, na kateri naj bi bili ob obali zaprti prosilci za azil. Ukrep se je hitro spremenil v farso, saj je tovorna barka v vodovodni napeljavi hranila smrtonosno bakterijo in malo je manjkalo, pa bi izbruhnila splošna zdravstvena kriza. In ker oblasti v domačih vrstah ne najdejo zdravstvenih in drugih delavcev, da bi oskrbovali kaotični vodni azilni sistem, so stekli pogovori o hitrih vizumih, s katerimi bi spodbudili tuje delavce k prihodu v Veliko Britanijo! Še tako protimigrantska evropska vlada mora danes vabiti tujce, pa tudi če zgolj zato, da varujejo druge tujce.\n\nTežave britanske migracijske politike pravzaprav odslikavajo razmere drugod po Evropi. Povsod, kjer je govor o migracijah, vidimo enake paradokse – države ne vedo, ali bi se zapirale ali odpirale. Prvak evropske protimigrantske desnice Viktor Orbán je ta teden iz zaporov izpustil 1400 tihotapcev ljudi, saj so zapori menda prenatrpani, tujci pa sestavljajo 13 odstotkov zapornikov. Orbán seveda dobro ve, da je to zapiranje tujcev farsa in da vsak dan skozi Madžarsko na Zahod potuje tisoče migrantov, ki jih nujno potrebujejo na deloviščih v Avstriji, Nemčiji in Franciji. Ve, da večina zaprtih sploh ni zares tihotapcev, ampak so zgolj naključni begunci, ki so bili obsojeni z namenom, da se svetu pošlje signal: »Madžarska je zaprta!« Samo zapiranje je torej teater, katerega vzdrževanje je zdaj postalo infrastrukturno prezahtevno in se mu oblasti odpovedujejo. A čeprav vse evropske države zaradi pomanjkanja kadrov potihoma dopuščajo sedanjo prepustnost zunanjih meja, je vrh EU ostro obsodil Orbánovo prizanesljivost do migrantov in zahteval nadaljevanje okrutnega zaporniškega performansa.\n\nTa čudaški spektakel hkratnega odpiranja in zapiranja Evrope je zgolj kazalec gospodarske razvojne zanke, v kateri se je znašla EU. Osrednje države se že desetletja spoprijemajo s krizo rasti dobičkov. Ta kriza se je od sedemdesetih let reševala s privatizacijo, selitvijo industrije v cenejše države ter napihovanjem finančnega in storitvenega sektorja. Cikel se je medtem izpel, delo, ki je ostalo v središču Evrope, pa je neproduktivno in temelji skoraj izključno na povečanem izkoriščanju delavcev. Samo poglejte, kaj se je zgodilo z gostinstvom ali transportom … Tu ustvarjajo dobičke le tako, da za vsako naslednjo generacijo delavcev najdejo način, kako jih plačati manj. In ker se obseg teh panog povečuje, domači proletariat pa manjša, je celoten evropski model rasti postal odvisen od prihoda tuje delovne sile, ki bo pripravljena zapolniti ta delovna mesta za manj denarja in pravic. Evropski vrh se tega zaveda in vsi hitijo privabljati tujce iz revnejših držav v svoje delovne obrate.\n\nSeveda pa je ta model rasti mogoč izključno ob predpostavki, da tujci prihajajo pod posebnimi pogoji – z različnimi začasnimi vizumi in skrajno omejenimi pravicami, brez dostopa do javnih sistemov ali politične enakopravnosti. Le tako se lahko prepreči, da bi iz njih nastal nov, samozavesten proletariat, ki bi zahteval enake pravice. Zato mora biti ob množičnem uvozu teh delavcev poskrbljeno tudi za njihovo nenehno poniževanje. Del tujcev mora biti izključen iz formalne ekonomije, zaprt v taborišča ali zapore, del jih mora živeti na ulici, del jih mora umreti v morju ali gozdu. Le tako bodo drugi veselo sprejeli kratkoročne vizume, 12-urni delovnik in minimalno plačo. In le tako bodo večno ostali zaznamovani kot drugorazredno prebivalstvo, ločeni od domačega delavstva, večno proizvajalci in nikoli potrošniki. Bibby Stockholm ob britanski obali ali zapori na Madžarskem so smešno neučinkoviti v funkciji obvladovanja migracij, ampak genialno učinkoviti v obvladovanju pričakovanj migrantov.\n\nSlovenija je hočeš nočeš postala del tega teatra. Še vedno je na obrobju Evrope, kjer je treba uprizarjati zaprtost Unije, hkrati pa se priključuje evropskim gospodarskim trendom, zaradi česar šefi histerično novačijo tuje delavce. Tako na eni strani vidimo brutalno zaprtost: Slovenija je prva v Evropi po deležu zaprtih tujcev (z 31 odstotki naši zapori daleč presegajo Orbánove), na vrhu je po številu zavrnjenih prosilcev za azil in nasploh je ena izmed držav, ki tujcem sistematično onemogočajo ureditev stalnega bivanja. Velik del tujcev, ki te dni pomagajo pri obnovi poplavljenih območij, je v deportacijskih postopkih in bodo težko ostali v državi, čeprav jih krvavo potrebujemo na deloviščih. Na drugi strani pa je radikalna odprtost: naš prvi socialistični minister za delo Luka Mesec se je te dni javno pohvalil, da je z ukrepi gospodarstvu priskrbel več kot 40 tisoč sezonskih delavcev in da sledi še odprtje konzulata na Filipinih, od koder si po zgledu Hrvaške obetajo še večji pritok poceni dela … Seveda z izgovorom, da bodo Filipinci pomagali pri odpravi poplavne škode, čeprav vsi vedo, da je njihova dejanska vloga v kuhinjah in skladiščih ustvarjati dobičke za kapitaliste.\n\nIn če še niste imeli dovolj paradoksov: pri doseganju tega cilja sodeluje nekdanji Meščev nasprotnik, bivši Janšev minister za gospodarstvo Zdravko Počivalšek, ki se je po desetletju soustvarjanja antimigrantskih politik lotil posla prihodnosti: uvoza migrantske delovne sile s Filipinov in iz Indije! Najprej je leta ustvarjal grozljive razmere za tujce, da jih lahko danes povabi vanje. Verjetno si lahko predstavljamo, v kakšnih okoliščinah bodo delali Počivalškovi Filipinci in kaj to pomeni za razgradnjo delavskih standardov v že tako izkoriščevalskih podjetjih, a se to kljub vsemu šteje za nekakšen uspeh Levice.\n\nKaj preostane evropskim delavcem, ko gledamo to sodelovanje »protimigrantske desnice« in »multikulti levice« pri uničevanju delavskih norm? Da zavrnemo njihov ekonomski model, ki temelji na čedalje večjem izkoriščanju vseh. Prvi korak k temu je zahteva po enakopravni obravnavi vseh delavcev in dokončni odpravi teatra okrutnosti, ki se v imenu obvladovanja migracij izvaja na evropskih mejah. \n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 0, "end": 33}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 123, "end": 136}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 139, "end": 168}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 394, "end": 483}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1376, "end": 1383}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1393, "end": 1451}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1568, "end": 1605}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1668, "end": 1675}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 1751, "end": 1868}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1896, "end": 1918}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1921, "end": 1979}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2630, "end": 2644}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3616, "end": 3726}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3754, "end": 3780}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4496, "end": 4506}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 4509, "end": 4535}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 4537, "end": 4588}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5160, "end": 5198}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 5704, "end": 5918}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 6088, "end": 6186}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6615, "end": 6626}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 7166, "end": 7176}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 7462, "end": 7562}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 7755, "end": 7765}], "article_id": "4449", "lang": "sl", "text": "Koronavirus in negotova prihodnost\n\nNegotovost je ključna beseda, ki jo je novi koronavirus naplavil na površje v trenutni globalni krizi. Občuti jo prav vsak posameznik, ki se sprašuje, kdaj bo spet vse po starem? Govorimo lahko tudi o epistemološki negotovosti, saj gre za negotovost glede dejstev in znanosti nasploh, ko govorimo o koronavirusu ter posledični globoki krizi, ki jo povzroča. Kriza, ki je danes zdravstvena, bo jutri gospodarska, a nato spet zdravstveno-gospodarska?\n\nOb naslednji jesenski ohladitvi vremena in času sezonskih grip bomo zopet v negotovosti pričakovali nove, ostrejše ukrepe za zajezitev najverjetnejšega naslednjega vala epidemije, a takrat bomo bolj pripravljeni, saj se lahko iz preteklih dogodkov veliko naučimo. \n\nNegotovost, četudi je v Sloveniji takrat še nismo čutili, nas je zadela že decembra 2019, ko so v kitajskem Vuhanu odkrili prve človeške okužbe s covidom-19. Podrobnosti prvih človeških okužb še vedno niso znane in jih bo najverjetneje moč pojasniti šele skozi lečo retrospektive. Poleg tega tudi učinkovitega cepiva še ni videti na obzorju, saj virus intenzivno mutira, na globalni ravni pa kroži več njegovih sevov. Dokler znanost ne bo dala jasnih odgovorov, se bomo morali zadovoljiti s številnimi teorijami zarote, ki se prikladno ponujajo v tako imenovanem obdobju postresnice. Pri tem velja izpostaviti tiste najbolj absurdne, kot so klasična zarota globalne elite, kitajske ali ameriške vlade, kakor tudi tiste novodobniške, a že precej obrabljene, kot je na primer 5G. V tem kontekstu ne gre izpustiti niti \"skorajšnje hitre rešitve po ameriško\", in sicer v obliki vbrizgavanja razkužila, ki so jo določeni kavbojci sicer preizkusili, a žal neuspešno. Nauk 21. stoletja je jasen, in sicer, kjer znanstveniki zaradi jasno predpisanih metodoloških okvirov znanstvenega raziskovanja še ne poznajo vseh odgovorov,  jih kar hitro zamenjajo samooklicani poznavalci, ki jadrajo na strahu pred neznanim in širijo teorije zarote. \n\nNašo majhno podalpsko deželico novi koronavirus kljub neposredni bližini z zelo prizadeto Italijo, kjer so se s prvimi primeri soočili konec januarja 2020,  še dolgo ni zadel. Na trenutke smo se lahko ob spremljanju medijev že zares zaskrbljeno spraševali, kaj delamo narobe? A vendarle je 4. marca 2020 končno zadelo tudi nas. Nadalje pa smo 12. marca zaradi naraščanja števila okužb razglasili epidemijo, dan zatem dobili novo vlado, kmalu pa tudi vse ukrepe za zajezitev novega virusa. Pri tem nismo menjavali strategij boja proti koronavirusu, kot to velja za Veliko Britanijo ali ZDA, temveč se je slovenska politika odločila za varno stran politične ceste in prioritizirala varnost ljudi, sekundarno pa z zakoni delno blažila posledice za kapital (ob pripravi novega ZUJF-a). Sprva je delovalo, da bo boja hitro konec, ljudje so zadihali od vsakodnevnega potrošniškega norenja, potovanj, družine so bile zopet več skupaj, lepo vreme pa je na trenutke dajalo občutek dopustovanja in pobeg od nove koronavirus realnosti. Zares nove so bile le maske, ki pa jih tako ali tako ni bilo dovolj. A vsega lepega je bilo hitro konec, ko smo ugotovili, da pravih rešitev še kmalu ne bo na spregled, saj smo skrbeli predvsem za vzdržnost zdravstvenega sistema pred potencialnim kolapsom ob napovedi množičnih obolenj in smrti. Začele so se prve (a ne množične) smrti, številna odpuščanja, ločitve, nelikvidnost in stečaji podjetij, ugasnile so celotne industrije, ukrepi pa so se kot zanka vsak dan tesneje oklepali naših vratov oz. občin. \n\nZačela se je slovenska različica negotovosti, kot ogenj podpihnjena s strahom za javno zdravje, polariziranostjo slovenskega političnega prostora, najrazličnejšimi fiaski pri javnem naročanju zaščitne opreme, kolesarskimi protesti in globalnimi teorijami zarote, ki so se množično širile po družbenih omrežjih, saj so bile gostilniške debate zaradi ukrepov nemogoče. Napetost se je stopnjevala praktično vsak dan, ko smo vedno znova čakali poročila o novih okužbah, namesto pričakovanega sproščanja ukrepov pa smo bili priča zategovanju in podaljševanju. A nato se je zgodil preboj sproščanja ukrepov, nemški preboj, ki smo mu – kot že večkrat do sedaj – hitro sledili tudi v Sloveniji.\n\nVse kaže, da je pred nami veselo obdobje, ko smo priča sproščanju ukrepov in neverjetnemu zadovoljstvu posameznikov, da lahko zopet spijejo tisto kavo, obiščejo frizerje, obiščejo svojce v drugih občinah in podobno. Ljudje se sprašujejo, kdaj bo spet vse po starem, tako kot je bilo pred koronakrizo. A kaj, če nikoli več ne bo? O tem pričajo številni epidemiologi, ki so si enotni. Za začetek nas čakajo novi (večji ali manjši) valovi povečane okuženosti s covidom-19, vse do točke, ko bomo bodisi dosegli več kot polovično prekuženost z novim virusom ali ob odkritju učinkovitega cepiva. Nošenje mask, prepoved skupinskih dogodkov, zmanjšani osebni stiki, delo na daljavo, oteženo potovanje in druge novitete postajajo del nove, naše skupne globalne realnosti. \n\nPri tem ostaja ključno vprašanje, in sicer kaj smo se pred prihodom jesenske verzije naučili iz prve, krajše sezone novega koronavirusa?  Kot posamezniki smo lahko za trenutek stopili iz norega kapitalističnega delovnega tempa, ki izžema človeškost, in morda uvideli, da slednjega, kakor tudi divjega potrošniškega konzumiranja, ravno ne potrebujemo v tej meri za polno življenje. Imeli smo več časa za osebni premislek in razvoj, posledično je bilo prisotnih več psiholoških stisk kot sicer, a to pomeni, da težave rešujemo s prespraševanjem in ne tajenjem. Predvsem pa smo ob odsotnosti stikov spoznali, da smo ljudje družbena bitja, ki si želimo skupnosti in sodelovanja, kakor tudi pristnih osebnih stikov in globokih odnosov. Poleg tega pa smo zopet pokazali izgubljeni pomen medgeneracijske solidarnosti, kjer so mlajši hodili v trgovino za starejše in jih učili uporabe novih tehnologij, namenjenih povezovanju in premagovanju osamljenosti. Na eni strani se je spremenila kultura uporabe digitalne tehnologije, ki je bila spodbujana kot sredstvo za premagovanje najrazličnejših učinkov krize na posameznika, na drugi strani pa smo se naučili še bolj ceniti gibanje v naravi in osebno svobodo gibanja nasploh. \n\nKot družba smo začeli razumevati pomen močnega in organiziranega javnega zdravstvenega sistema, ki se je izkazal kot najboljše orožje za boj držav proti koronavirusu. Slednji je preživel svojo prvo pravo generalko boja z novim koronavirusom in ima izkušnje za soočanje z novimi boji. Poleg tega pa se je preko interventnih zakonov za pomoč gospodarstvu izkazal pomen vpliva države na prej tako opevani prosti trg in njegovo nevidno roko, ki se je v času krize polomila. Kljub temu je jasno, da so ukrepi države za pomoč gospodarstvu zgolj kratkoročna premostitev, ki ji bo sledila gospodarska kriza, ki bo ugasnila številna podjetja in povzročila večjo brezposelnost. Gospodarstvo se bo moralo prilagoditi na vedno bolj spremenljive globalne razmere in nov modus operandi ter pripraviti na morebitni jesenski val, ki ga epidemiologi z veliko gotovostjo napovedujejo. Pri tem velja še posebej izpostaviti pomen digitalne transformacije gospodarstva kot nujni proces, ki ga je koronakriza še dodatno pohitrila, kakor tudi razmislek o celotnem modelu poslovanja in vedno bolj zeleni prihodnosti nasploh. Za konec velja izpostaviti tudi izkazan pomen EU, ki med drugimi s skupnim financiranjem intenzivno spodbuja zdravstveno in drugo raziskovanje ter digitalne inovacije. \n\nGloboke krize spreminjajo družbo in okolje v najširšem smislu, zato pomembno determinirajo prihodnost. Česar vendarle ne gre cinično zanemariti, saj smo zaenkrat pokazali, da družba obstaja in je še kako živa, prilagodljiva, kakor tudi bojevita. To se ob težkih globalnih preizkušnjah, kot je koronakriza, še bolj jasno kaže. To pa daje trhlico upanja za skupno globalno nagovarjanje tudi drugih problemov, ki pestijo človeštvo. \n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 80, "end": 100}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 442, "end": 497}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 509, "end": 584}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 579, "end": 584}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 620, "end": 730}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 835, "end": 893}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1074, "end": 1171}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1222, "end": 1256}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1310, "end": 1360}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1327, "end": 1341}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1364, "end": 1407}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1410, "end": 1430}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1416, "end": 1430}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 1461, "end": 1556}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1794, "end": 1813}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 1844, "end": 1898}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2002, "end": 2043}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2129, "end": 2144}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2160, "end": 2206}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 2250, "end": 2348}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2443, "end": 2467}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2443, "end": 2589}], "article_id": "445", "lang": "sl", "text": "Scholz in Biden v Washingtonu pozvala kongresnike, naj potrdijo pomoč Ukrajini\n\nAmeriški republikanci pomoč Ukrajini pogojujejo s strožjim nadzorom južne meje\n\nNemški kancler Olaf Scholz je na obisku v Beli hiši dejal, da želi podpreti prizadevanja ameriškega predsednika Joeja Bidna pri zagotavljanju sredstev za Ukrajino.\n\nOba politika sta pozvala ameriški kongres, naj odobri dolgo odlašani paket vojaške pomoči Ukrajini, in opozorila, da Kijev brez te pomoči ne bo mogel zadržati ruske invazije.

Le na ta način se lahko nekateri vzorci in prakse vlečejo toliko let. Le na ta način se lahko ponavljajo vedno znova iste napake.\n\nČeprav so obdobje prejšnje vlade zaznamovale številne napačne in milo rečeno nenavadne poteze v boju proti covid-19, pa tudi zgodbe o korupciji, to očitno nikogar več ne zanima. Vlada RS\n\nMinuli teden je šla neopazno mimo novica, ki bi še nedolgo nazaj povzročila splošno zgražanje. Časnik Delo je namreč poročal, da so se uslužbenci Nacionalnega inštituta za javno zdravje (NIJZ) udeležili skupinskega druženja v vinski kleti nekje na Vipavskem. Kje je tu novica, me boste vprašali. In zakaj bi bilo to sploh pomembno? Ker konec oktobra, ko so se zaposleni na NIJZ odločili za \"team building\", ni bil dva meseca nazaj, ampak leta 2021 – med vrhuncem četrtega vala epidemije covid-19.\n\nZavrtimo si spomin nazaj. Konec oktobra 2021 smo morali v Sloveniji v javnih prostorih še vedno nositi maske. V državo je prišla različica delta, ki je bila precej bolj kužna od alfe. Beležili smo več kot 16 tisoč aktivnih okužb, torej 13 tisoč več kot v času prvega zapiranja občinskih meja. Druženje je bilo spet prepovedana beseda. Oblast je vsakega, ki je protestiral, obtožila širjenja virusa. Na NIJZ so v paniki naročali nov klicni center, zaradi česar so povozili vsa pravila javnega naročanja. \"Čas je, ko moramo misliti drug na drugega,\" je dejal njegov direktor Milan Krek. Le dan pozneje so se njegovi uslužbenci odpravili na izlet v vinsko klet.\n\nČe bi za žur NIJZ-jevcev izvedeli takrat, tisto mračno jesen 2021, bi bila država na nogah. Po prleškem sendviču bi dobili še afero vipavska klet. Javnost bi se upravičeno spraševala, zakaj ključna institucija, zadolžena za boj proti epidemiji, tega ne vodi z lastnim zgledom. Tedanja opozicija bi Kreka pozvala k odstopu. Pred NIJZ bi v sredo protestiral Stevanović, dva dni pozneje pa kolesarji. Na greznici, tedaj še znani kot Twitter, bi troli razglašali, da so bili na žuru levičarski podtaknjenci, ki namenoma sabotirajo marljivega in poštenega Kreka.\n\nToda v teh dneh se po objavi novice, ki še vedno sproža neprijeten občutek, da se je nekdo iz nas takrat delal norca, ni zgodilo nič. Zakaj? Ker smo obdobje covid-19 in vse, kar je prineslo s seboj, potlačili v pozabo.\n\nSe spomnite podtaknjencev? In triaže v Šmarju?\n\nMed obdobjem covid-19 je tedanja oblast de facto suspendirala parlament in vladala z odloki. Ko je bil vstop v bolnišnice dovoljen le \"zdravim\". Ko so zdravniki prejemali covid dodatke zato, da so bili doma. Ko so bile cerkve odprte, šole pa zaprte. Ko so prej kot kronični bolniki, starejši od 60 let, do cepiva lahko prišli diplomati. Ko so ljudem, popolnoma neukim v razumevanju tehnik širjenja virusa, resno razlagali, da morajo maske nositi tudi na samotnih sprehodih v gozdovih.\n\nV tej množici se je našel marsikateri ukrep, ki bi nas moral zanimati še danes. Recimo: nobena od institucij v Sloveniji se ni nikoli lotila vseh sumov korupcije in z njo povezanih tveganj pri tako imenovanih podtaknjencih,s katerimi je takratna oblast pod okriljem proti koronskih ukrepov nagrajevala sebi zveste skupine in interese.\n\nNaprej: še danes v resnici ne vemo, kaj se je med prvim valom epidemije dogajalo v Šmarju pri Jelšah. Zakaj se obolelih varovancev tamkajšnjega doma za starejše spomladi 2020 niso odločili zdraviti v bolnišnici? Je prav zaradi takšne triaže kar devet od desetih varovancev domov med prvim valom epidemije umrlo v domovih? In kdo je to odločitev na vladni ali drugi ravni sprejel? Ali pa: kdo vse je bil odgovoren, da domovi za starejši niso pravočasno dobili denarja za vzpostavitev rdečih con, kamor bi lahko ločili obolele?\n\nZakaj Britanci preiskujejo epidemijo, mi pa ne?\n\nPozor: govorimo o smrtih, o sumih malomarnosti in korupcije. O Veliki Britaniji in njenem političnem razredu, sploh po \"brexitu\", si lahko mislimo marsikaj. Toda Borisa Johnsona so zabave med \"lockdowni\" na sedežu vlade stale položaja. Bil je prvi premier v zgodovini, ki ga je policija oglobila zaradi kršenja zakona. Še prejšnji mesec ga je pet ur zasliševala britanska neodvisna komisija, ki preiskuje odziv vlade na pandemijo covida. \"Žal mi je,\" je sporočil svojcem 175 tisoč žrtev pandemije.\n\nPri nas kaj takega očitno nikoli ni prišlo v poštev. Delovanja oblasti med epidemijo ne preiskuje nobena parlamentarna komisija. Pozabili smo na nekdanjo šolsko ministrico, ki so jo šele ustavni sodniki morali prisiliti k odprtju šol za otroke s posebnimi potrebami. Pa na podjetniške junake iz afere maske, ki danes prigarane milijone iz posredniških poslov z državo vlagajo v nepremičnine. Pa na serviete z gumico, ki jih je tedanji minister označil za \"plod domačega znanja\". Saj res: kje je že tistih 13 ovadb računskega sodišča?\n\nPozabili smo na smrt mladoletnice, ki so jo cepili z zanjo neprimernim tipom cepiva. Pa na šarlatansko promocijo cepljenja, prepoved točenja bencina za necepljene, kadrovska masakriranja po NIJZ med prvim valom epidemije in bone za nakupe slušalk. Vse to smo kolektivno potisnili v globoko podzavest. Kot da se nikoli ni zgodilo. Celo z \"obdukcijo\" epidemije se ne ukvarja nihče več. Zdravnik dr. Alojz Ihan je pred dnevi opozoril, da na spletnih straneh ministrstva in NIJZ ni več mogoče najti dokumentov, poročil in analiz iz obdobja pandemije.\n\nSvetovni prvaki v slepenju samega sebe\n\nA vse to nas v resnici ne sme presenetiti. Slovenija je namreč družba, ki ne želi imeti trohice zgodovinskega spomina. Verjetno smo svetovni prvaki v slepenju samega sebe. V kolektivni pozabi in pretvarjanju, da se nekaj ni zgodilo. Le na ta način se lahko nekateri vzorci in prakse vlečejo toliko let. Le na ta način se lahko ponavljajo vedno znova iste napake.\n\nNajnovejši primer: v zadnjih dneh smo izvedeli, da nas bo obratovanje TEŠ6 zaradi zavajanj s ceno premoga in vseh drugih zgrešenih odločitev v naslednjih desetih letih stalo še dve milijardi evrov. Medtem ko bo država energetiko Šaleške doline očitno prenesla na novo \"slabo banko\", kriminalisti pa ugotavljajo, koliko milijonov evrov je izginilo pri dobaviteljskih poslih, se krepijo pritiski, da je treba \"takoj\" začeti z gradnjo drugega bloka nuklearke. Ne glede na ceno, velikost ali tehnično rešitev. Pritiska tudi \"gospodarstvo\", kar zveni znano. Enako je namreč počelo v letih 2009 in 2010 za TEŠ6. Samo, da \"se gradnja že začne\".\n\nKer tako radi pozabljamo, gre karavana pač vsakič dalje. Enkrat za nekaj časa nasede v finančnem breznu kakšnega energetskega projekta, drugič pa v vipavski kleti med epidemijo. Kar smo si izbrisali iz spomina, se pač nikoli ni zgodilo, mar ne?\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 0, "end": 9}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 12, "end": 93}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 76, "end": 93}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 96, "end": 245}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 200, "end": 218}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 446, "end": 467}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 471, "end": 592}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 542, "end": 558}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 595, "end": 721}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 705, "end": 721}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 776, "end": 801}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 810, "end": 843}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 956, "end": 973}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 983, "end": 999}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 1039, "end": 1236}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1175, "end": 1197}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1242, "end": 1265}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1378, "end": 1391}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1485, "end": 1497}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1900, "end": 1992}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1996, "end": 2145}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 2200, "end": 2221}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2250, "end": 2321}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 2285, "end": 2321}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2376, "end": 2419}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2538, "end": 2548}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2612, "end": 2718}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2775, "end": 2784}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2787, "end": 2850}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2890, "end": 2895}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3066, "end": 3086}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3066, "end": 3151}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3224, "end": 3234}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3432, "end": 3455}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3596, "end": 3672}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3674, "end": 3748}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3722, "end": 3725}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3831, "end": 4001}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3975, "end": 3981}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4035, "end": 4115}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4155, "end": 4324}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4272, "end": 4285}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4307, "end": 4324}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 4477, "end": 4537}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4490, "end": 4512}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4516, "end": 4537}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4844, "end": 4858}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4861, "end": 4924}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4886, "end": 4895}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5213, "end": 5250}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5342, "end": 5358}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5495, "end": 5586}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5724, "end": 5824}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5808, "end": 5824}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5827, "end": 5922}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5900, "end": 5922}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5925, "end": 6051}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5981, "end": 5986}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5995, "end": 6010}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6054, "end": 6169}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6096, "end": 6106}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6241, "end": 6292}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6266, "end": 6278}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6283, "end": 6292}], "article_id": "4451", "lang": "sl", "text": "Vojne igre\n\nSo naši, torej zahodni voditelji res zadnji glas razuma v sicer poblaznelem svetu?\n\nZahodni mediji, ki jih povzemajo tudi slovenska uredništva, imajo navado v rednih presledkih objavljati zastrašujoče članke o potezah tujih državnikov. »Kitajska izvaja letalske vaje nad Tajvanom«, »Pjongjang ob jedrskih provokacijah ne bi omahoval z jedrskim odgovorom«, »Iran pospešeno plemeniti uran«, »Predsednik ruskega parlamenta posvaril pred tretjo svetovno vojno« … Javnost je vendarle treba opomniti, da živimo v nevarnem svetu, polnem norih diktatorjev, ki imajo prst vedno na sprožilcu. Le kaj bi se zgodilo, če ne bi bilo naših razumnih voditeljev in seveda Natovih sil, da nas branijo pred temi vojnimi jastrebi? Znova in znova se v medijih tako utrjuje dihotomija »trezni in odgovorni Zahod« proti »poblaznelemu avtoritarnemu Vzhodu«. Kdor je izpostavljen izključno zahodnim liberalnim medijem, utegne živeti v prepričanju, da so naši voditelji zadnji glas razuma v sicer poblaznelem svetu.\n\nZato smo lahko toliko bolj hvaležni nizozemskemu admiralu Robu Bauerju, predsedniku Natovega vojaškega odbora, da je prejšnji teden opomnil evropsko javnost, kako daleč od treznosti in razumnosti so dejansko odtavali naši predstavniki. Na bizarni, s čustvi nabiti tiskovni konferenci smo med drugim slišali, da Nato pripravlja največje vojaške vaje v zgodovini organizacije (v vojnih igrah bo sodelovalo 90 tisoč vojakov, med njimi 200 slovenskih), da prehajamo v pripravljenost na totalno vojno z Rusijo, da bo ta v prihodnjih letih zagotovo napadla Evropo, da se morata zato tudi civilna družba in industrija podrediti krepitvi vojaških sposobnosti in da bi si morali za preživetje vsi prebivalci pripraviti »vodo, radijski sprejemnik z baterijami in svetilko, da bi preživeli prvih 36 ur«. Ne, to ni bila tiskovka iz Pjongjanga – najvišji predstavnik največje vojaške koalicije nam sporoča, da ni alternative totalni civilizacijski vojni in naj se vsi pripravimo na življenje v bunkerjih.\n\nV nezahodnih medijih so podobnih izjav Natovih predstavnikov že vajeni, navsezadnje sam Joe Biden vsaj enkrat na teden v svet pošlje podobno sporočilo. Vseeno pa si lahko predstavljamo, kako so Bauerjeve apokaliptične napovedi učinkovale v tujem tisku – vsak si je lahko ustvaril vtis, da smo na Zahodu že popolnoma poblazneli. Ali lahko za kogarkoli res obstaja še kanček dvoma, da je Nato največja grožnja svetovnemu miru? V primerjavi z razsežnostjo njegovih vojaških vaj in napovedano totalno mobilizacijo proti Rusiji je Kim Džong Unovo nastopaštvo videti skromno. In ne pozabimo, da ves svet že mesece opazuje neodgovorno ravnanje zahodnih sil, ki vojaško in finančno podpirajo izraelski genocid nad Palestinci v Gazi. Na Zahodu se bojimo ponovnega vzpona Trumpa in drugih populistov, ki naj bi zamajali trezno in odgovorno ravnanje naših institucij, za večino sveta pa se je kakršnakoli utvara o treznosti in odgovornosti naših držav že zdavnaj razblinila. Čeprav se nam sredinski voditelji doma zdijo kolikor toliko racionalni, večina človeštva od njih sliši le krvoločne provokacije, ob katerih Trump dejansko deluje kot bister in razumen diplomat.\n\nZagotovo pa si podoben vtis o naših voditeljih ustvarja tudi vse več Zahodnjakov. Bauerjevo tiskovno konferenco so mediji povsem nekritično povzemali, bralci na družabnih omrežjih in v komentarjih pa so dobesedno pobesneli. V vsej Evropi ne boste našli človeka, ki bi padel na ceneno Natovo propagando. Nekaj je, da s takšnimi izjavami provociraš tuje državnike, nekaj popolnoma drugega pa, da hočeš z njimi »navdušiti« domače prebivalstvo. Le kaj so mislili Natovi piarovci – da Evropejci hrepenimo po vojni z Rusijo? In ali so res računali, da bo kdo kupil njihove laži o skorajšnji invaziji? Danes je večini Evropejcev in Američanov jasno, da jih Rusija vojaško ne ogroža. Govoriti, da bo vojska države, ki se že drugo leto z ogromnimi žrtvami bori za nekaj metrov zemlje v Ukrajini, jutri vkorakala na Dunaj, je pač žaljivo do našega intelekta. Prav tako je vsem jasno, da je Zahod z nenehno dobavo orožja in spodkopavanjem mirovnih procesov sokriv za vojno, ki si jo ves svet prizadeva končati. Še tisto malo moralnega kapitala, ki so ga zahodni voditelji imeli pri poseganju v ukrajinsko vojno, se je zgubilo v ruševinah Gaze in z bombardiranjem izstradanega Jemna. Vsi lahko tudi opazujemo bistveno odgovornejšo mirovniško diplomacijo držav, kot so Kitajska, Brazilija, celo Južnoafriška republika. Naj nas še tako zasipavajo z zastrašujočimi novicami o ekscesih tujih režimov, med prebivalci ni nobenega navdušenja nad »končnim obračunom z Rusijo«, nad »discipliniranjem Irana« ali »demokratizacijo Tajvana«. Niti ni več trdnega prepričanja, da je naša stran v kateremkoli konfliktu zares prava stran.\n\nDa si Evropejci želimo predvsem miru in stabilnosti, pa je spet prva spoznala skrajna desnica. Leta spodletelih Natovih provokacij in ustvarjanja vojnih žarišč so paradoksalno prinesla novo platformo za stranke in politike, ki so bile nekoč goreče podpornice vsake vojne, danes pa obljubljajo umik podpore Ukrajini in preusmeritev vojaških proračunov k drugim projektom. Liberalizem je postal sinonim za vojne eskalacije, desničarji pa so začeli, četudi površinsko in brez resnih zavez, kritizirati politiko Nata in EU. Med njimi so vzpenjajoči se nemški desničarji iz AfD in nizozemski rasist Geert Wilders, podobno retoriko sta znala dobro uporabiti tudi Giorgia Meloni in Orbán. Prvi v tej druščini pa je seveda Donald Trump, ki se po obdobju Bidnove kaotične zunanje politike ameriški javnosti kaže kot resen državnik – človek, ki bo znal skleniti »dobre kupčije« s tujimi voditelji.\n\nZa ponovni vzpon desnice pa ne bodo krivi Rusi, Kitajci ali Iranci – krivi bodo evropski in ameriški liberalci, ki nočejo in nočejo potegniti zavore pri vojnem hujskaštvu. Krivi bodo ministri in poslanci, ki namenjajo vse večji delež proračunov norim Natovim avanturam. Krivi bodo liberalni novinarji, ki nekritično povzemajo blazne izjave vojnih jastrebov in se jih pogosto celo trudijo prekositi. In krivi bomo vsi, ki se ob tem drvenju v vojni pekel ne organiziramo, ne protestiramo, ne zahtevamo izstopa iz Nata. Že dolgo ni bilo večje potrebe po organiziranju proti imperializmu – bodo pobudo res prevzeli konservativci in ksenofobi? \n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 27,

"lang": "sl", "text": "Kdaj nehati protestirati?\n\nTaktika oblasti, ki so jo prejšnji teden utelešale predvsem izjave Aleša Hojsa, da protivladne proteste prikaže kot izraz radikalizirane manjšine in kot veliko nevarnost za širjenje virusa, je prozoren manever diskreditacije, osnovan na populističnih predpostavkah o »zdravi« večini in izrojeni manjšinski drugosti, ki najeda sicer harmonično in zdravo družbo. Glede na to, da je ta manever izredno uspešen tudi v primerih veliko abstraktnejših in umetno ustvarjenih zunanjih sovražnikov, ni čudno, da deluje tudi v situaciji, ko se zdi, da si udeleženci uličnih protestov zelo konkretno dovolijo točno tisto, čemur se morajo vsi ostali v imenu skupnega dobrega odreči – namreč druženju in nenujnim družbenim stikom. Kot je dobro znano iz nekaterih Žižkov klasičnih izvajanj, pa je ravno tovrstno ekscesivno razkazovanje užitka, ki ga gledalec dojema kot »užitek drugega«, ki se mu mora sam odreči, tisto, ki generira sovraštvo in netolerantnost do določenih družbenih skupin in njihovih užitkov.\n\nKljub temu da gre za precej klasičen populistični manever, pa ga žal ne moremo enostavno odpraviti kot zgolj priročno sredstvo za ideološko diskreditacijo. Trenutno situacijo namreč ključno zaznamujeta naključno srečanje dveh diskurzov – strokovno-znanstvenega in politično-ideološkega – ter dejstvo, da je zamejevanje epidemije že po svoji strokovni plati imanentno antidemokratično: zahteva namreč distanco in preprečevanje fizičnega stika, medtem ko demokracija – vsaj v svoji tradicionalni obliki – temelji prav na »skupnjevanju« (kot bi dejal Tonči Kuzmanić), torej na glasnem izražanju mnenj v javnem prostoru, ki ga poleg distribucije mnenj in političnih izrazov zaznamuje tudi potencialna distribucija virusa polnih kužnih kapljic.\n\nDrži sicer, da za zdaj ni nikakršnega dokaza, da bi se virus širil na petkovih protivladnih protestih, vendar pa to ne pomeni, da lahko kategorično trdimo, da je kaj takega povsem nemogoče, sploh če upoštevamo nekatere raziskave, ki poudarjajo vlogo t. i. superokužb. Te so sicer pogostejše na množičnih srečanjih v zaprtih prostorih, vendar pa obstajajo tudi posamični primeri, ko so bili za razrast epidemije ključni množični dogodki na odprtem – spomnimo se le zloglasne nogometne tekme med Atalanto in Valencio, ki je sopogojevala prvi val epidemije v Italiji in Španiji.\n\nTežava, ki jo skušam zarisati, je sicer s perspektive večine protestov, ki trenutno globalno vznikajo, irelevantna. Protesti zanikovalcev covida-19, anticepilcev, skrajno desnih Trumpovih privržencev, norih teoretikov zarot in tudi bolj zdravorazumsko-potrčevskih borcev proti maskam so namreč protesti, ki so obenem protesti proti oblasti in proti strokovnim epidemiološkim ukrepom. S perspektive teh protestnikov so opozorila znanstvene stroke irelevantna: virus bodisi ne obstaja, bodisi ni pretirano nevaren, bodisi so številke prirejene itd. Na drugi strani se skuša slovensko protestniško gibanje distancirati od tovrstnih karnevalov in se vzpostaviti kot striktno protivladno gibanje, ki ni usmerjeno proti ukrepom za zajezitev epidemije.\n\nPri tem pa se pogosto ujame v strukturno nujno ambivalentnost. Prejšnji teden, ko se je število dnevnih okužb bližalo številki štiristo, bi morda pričakovali, da bo kdo od glavnih akterjev levega spektra civilne družbe pozval vsaj k premisleku glede tega, ali je izvedba neorganiziranih množičnih protestov, na katerih je navkljub deklarativnemu pozivu k spoštovanju ukrepov nemogoče povsem nadzorovati situacijo, še vedno smiselna (eden redkih, ki razmišljajo v tej smeri, je po moji vednosti Tadej Troha). V nasprotju s tem smo dobili povsem enoznačno sporočilo, da se bodo protesti nadaljevali, kar je deloma razumljivo, saj bi kar koli nasprotnega pomenilo podreditev navodilom Aleša Hojsa. Vendar pa to nujno pomeni tudi približevanje bolj »looney« variacijam svetovnega protestništva. Zdi se skratka, da smo soočeni s klasično brezizhodno situacijo »lose-lose«, ki bi jo lahko presekala le jasna deklaracija protestniških akterjev glede tega, kdaj bodo številke – če očitno še niso – dovolj kritične za prenehanje protestov ali njihovo preselitev v virtualni prostor.  \n\nVse opisano je le zrcalna podoba tega, kako se v trenutni situaciji pozicionira slovenska vlada. Upal bi si denimo staviti, da bi v alternativni verziji zgodovine, v kateri levosredinska Šarčeva vlada ne bi odstopila, SDS v času epidemije skušal iz opozicije populistično nabirati glasove tudi z zanikovanjem resnosti situacije, kritiziranjem ukrepov in simpatiziranjem z nasprotovalci mask, cepiv in tehnologije 5G. V realni situaciji pa postopa povsem nasprotno in ne sledi Trumpovemu ali Bolsonarovemu zgledu relativizacije epidemije, kar bi morda lahko pričakovali. Še več, svojo legitimnost trenutna vlada utemeljuje predvsem z vzpostavitvijo čim bolj neizpodbitnega enačaja med politično oblastjo in zdravstveno stroko. Smiselnost te intence zlahka utemeljujejo tudi anketne raziskave, ki kažejo na diskrepanco med zaupanjem prebivalstva v zdravstvo in ne-zaupanjem v vladno politiko. Prav to diskrepanco skušajo zakrpati najkoristnejši igralci trenutne vlade, ki vsi po vrsti zasedajo vmesno pozicijo med politiko in stroko, denimo Jelko Kacin, Bojana Beović in – nekoliko manj uspešno – Milan Krek.\n\nKarte so v trenutni situaciji torej jasno razdeljene: vladna politika ljubljanske proteste diskreditira tako, da jih prikazuje kot zdravstveno tvegane in ignorantne do epidemioloških ukrepov, pri tem pa spretno izkorišča tudi antijanšistični nasprotovalni refleks, s perspektive katerega je nasprotovanje Janši vedno in povsod povsem sprejemljivo. Zaradi tega refleksa, ki lahko v svoji skrajnosti sam pristaja na osnovno predpostavko janšistične politike – »kdor ni z nami, je proti nam« – je mogoče predvidevati, da bodo protestniki storili točno tisto, kar bosta Hojs in Janša odsvetovala. S tem se protesti v trenutni situaciji izpostavljajo zasuku v bolj »looney« smer, diskreditaciji kot radikalnemu manjšinskemu odklonu in tudi vplivu raznoraznih »infiltratorjev«, zloraba katerih SDS-u, kot nakazujejo nekatere izkušnje iz preteklosti, ni povsem tuja.\n\nV dani situaciji se mi zato, četudi nimam nič proti Sapramiški, ne zdi pretirano produktivno slaviti podobo Svetlane Makarovič, ki se na protestih brez maske upira policistom. Mislim tudi, da ne bo uspel manever preusmerjanja pozornosti k policijskemu nasilju, h kateremu se trenutno obračajo levi mnenjski vplivneži, saj sta pretirana performativnost in prisilna identifikacija z Georgeem Floydom nasploh dva izmed manj prepričljivih elementov slovenskega protestniškega gibanja.\n\nVztrajanje pri protestiranju ne glede na napredovanje epidemije pa bi bilo vredno preizprašati tudi zato, ker so protesti, ki so se vseskozi deklarirali kot prvenstveno antijanšistični in niso skušali preseči dispozitivov parlamentarnega realizma – izjave glavnih akterjev glede ciljev gibanja so bile vedno nekaj v stilu »želimo padec vlade, predčasne volitve itd.« – pravzaprav dosegli svoj namen. Zdi se namreč, da je uspavana opozicija pod vplivom civilne družbe v pobudi Koalicije ustavnega loka končno le izumila načrt za odstavitev trenutne oblasti, ki se, upoštevajoč trenutno situacijo v DeSUS-u, zdi sorazmerno realističen in izvedljiv. Pobudniki omenjene iniciative so v svojem besedilu tudi jasno vzpostavili povezavo s protestniškim gibanjem, za katerega so zatrdili, da v zadnjih mesecih »ohranja kritičnega duha in dviga pogum prebivalstvu naše dežele«.\n\nPo drugi strani pa je jasno tudi, da vlada tako v odnosu do protestniškega gibanja kot v odnosu do njegovega bolj institucionalnega odmeva uporablja isti model diskreditacije – »gre za skrajno levičarsko, manjšinsko gibanje, ki nima podpore večinskega prebivalstva«. Uspešna diskreditacija protestov, do katere bi lahko privedlo potencialno širjenje virusa ali kakšen drug škandal z negativno javno podobo, je pomembna zato, ker implicira tudi uspešno diskreditacijo omenjenega gibanja in celotne parlamentarne opozicije. Tudi zato bi morda lahko, medtem ko bo v okolju Zoom kar mrgolelo konstruktivnih sestankov opozicijskih strank, ulični protestniki odšli na zaslužen karantenski počitek ali svoje delovanje prilagodili situaciji, kar ne izključuje vrnitve na ulice v epidemiološko ugodnejših časih. Ta počitek ne bi bil nujno utemeljen na uboganju Aleša Hojsa, temveč na lastni avtonomni presoji glede resnosti situacije. Zmožnost tovrstnega razmisleka predstavlja boljši performativ distanciranja od janšizma kot zgolj reprodukcija predvidljivih antijanšističnih reakcij.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 28, "end": 122}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 126, "end": 130}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 201, "end": 252}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 279, "end": 302}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 584, "end": 701}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 623, "end": 641}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 765, "end": 781}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 817, "end": 914}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 947, "end": 996}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1097, "end": 1147}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1438, "end": 1456}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1522, "end": 1544}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 1799, "end": 1949}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2048, "end": 2060}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 2573, "end": 2632}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2573, "end": 2632}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2650, "end": 2654}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2718, "end": 2776}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2803, "end": 2826}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 2854, "end": 2947}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 2883, "end": 2924}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 3470, "end": 3539}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3542, "end": 3696}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 3699, "end": 3710}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 3836, "end": 3962}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4015, "end": 4086}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4018, "end": 4042}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 4089, "end": 4149}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4503, "end": 4570}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 4707, "end": 4749}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 4707, "end": 4749}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5246, "end": 5253}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 5457, "end": 5551}], "article_id": "4453", "lang": "sl", "text": "Auschwitz-Izrael-Palestina\n\nČas je, da za Nemčijo in Evropo raison d'état postane rešitev izraelsko-palestinskega konflikta.\n\nZahod zaradi slabe vesti do Judov že več desetletij ignorira, da je Izrael demokracija z zelo veliko pomanjkljivostjo in napako, saj so Arabci v Izraelu drugorazredni državljani. FOTO: Mohammed Abed/AFP\n\nNemškemu obiskovalcu Frankfurtskega knjižnega sejma, ki je kriče prekinjal nastop Slavoja Žižka in mu očital, da relativizira odgovornost Hamasa za nastalo stanje, je Slavoj Žižek odgovoril, da zgolj poskuša postaviti celotno situacijo v širši kontekst. Žižek, ki mu gre vsa pohvala, se je na histerične medklice nemškega obiskovalca odzval olikano in ni želel zaostrovati. Lahko pa ugibamo, kakšni bi bili odzivi v dvorani, če bi kdo neotesanemu Nemcu zabrusil, naj bo vendar tiho, saj države Izrael in posledično izraelsko-palestinskega konflikta ne bi bilo, če ne bi bilo holokavsta, ki so ga izvedli prav Nemci.\n\nDržave Izrael ne bi bilo, če ne bi bilo holokavsta. Dokaz za to je, da se ob takšni trditvi kar precej zmedejo celo samozavestni izraelski diplomati, ki so včasih nediplomatsko pravičniški in agresivni. No, ja, začnejo mencati, če ne bi bilo holokavsta, bi država Izrael morda ne nastala leta 1948, bi pa skoraj gotovo nastala pozneje. Kje? Kdaj? Na takšna vprašanja izraelski diplomati niso pripravljeni odgovarjati. Če jim jih postavi nekdo, ki ni Jud, praviloma menijo, da je spraševalec zakrknjen antisemit. Če jim jih postavi Jud, pa praviloma menijo, da je spraševalec ignorantski antisionist.\n\nSionizem, politično gibanje Judov za samostojno državo Izrael, je po prvi svetovni vojni doživljalo krizo. Vse manj Judov se je izseljevalo v Palestino, ki je bila takrat britanski protektorat. Potem pa je v Nemčiji prišel na oblast Avstrijec Hitler. Izrael je nastal zaradi slabe vesti Evrope (vključno s Sovjetsko zvezo), ker je med drugo svetovno vojno naredila zelo malo, da bi preprečili holokavst. In seveda zaradi stoletnega evropskega antisemitizma. Tiste, ki so preživeli Auschwitz in druge tovarne smrti, se je pomilovalo. Istočasno so bili mnogi in marsikje v Evropi prav zadovoljni, da so bili preživeli Judi preusmerjeni v Palestino. Bili so sicer tudi predlogi, da bi izpraznili del okupirane Nemčije in ga dali Judom, da tam ustvarijo svojo državo. Iz tega ni bilo nič. Krivico, storjeno Judom, je Evropa rešila tako, da je naredila krivico Palestincem.\n\nIzrael je na Bližnjem vzhodu sčasoma postal nekakšen kulturno-civilizacijski podaljšek Evrope. Sčasoma se je zelo močno povezal z ZDA in njenimi interesi. Izrael je del Zahoda, Izrael je demokracija, Izrael je »naš«. Evropa oziroma Zahod zaradi slabe vesti do Judov že več desetletij ignorira, da je Izrael demokracija z zelo veliko pomanjkljivostjo in napako, saj so Arabci v Izraelu drugorazredni državljani. In to od samega začetka. Kako dolgo je država, ki ima nekaj milijonov drugorazrednih državljanov, še lahko demokracija?\n\nNajvečjo odgovornost za nastanek Izraela ima Evropa, najbolj konkretno pa Nemčija in Avstrija. Hitler je bil Avstrijec, antisemitizma kot političnega orodja in orožja se je v mladih letih učil na Dunaju, med nacističnimi vojnimi zločinci je bilo disproporcionalno veliko Avstrijcev. Še posebno Nemci in Avstrijci imajo zelo velik interes, da izraelsko-palestinskega konflikta ne bi obravnavali v širšem kontekstu in da se ne bi spraševali, kako in zakaj se je vse skupaj začelo. Kajti to lahko pripelje do zaključka, da izraelsko-palestinskega konflikta ne bi bilo, če ne bi bilo holokavsta. Pravzaprav ni čudno, da so bili prvi odzivi predsednice evropske komisije Ursule von der Leyen v zvezi s sedanjim zaostrovanjem okoli Gaze tako enostranske. Je pač Nemka. Tudi ni čudno, da sta prav Nemčija in Avstrija v prvih odzivih predlagali, naj se Palestincem v Gazi ukine vsakršno pomoč. Tisti, katerih predniki so tako ali drugače omogočili holokavst, so pač hoteli pokazati, da so tokrat povsem na judovski strani.\n\nKolesa zgodovine ne moremo zavrteti nazaj. Hamas je teroristična organizacija, ki je pred tedni v Izraelu storila zločine. Izrael ima pravico, da se brani in onemogoči delovanje Hamasa. Gotovo pa Izrael nima pravice, da onemogoči delovanje Hamasa ne oziraje se na življenja civilistov v Gazi in ne oziraje se na humanitarno mednarodno pravo. Holokavst Izraelcem ne daje te pravice. Zaradi Auschwitza Izraelci niso moralno superiorni in nimajo zgodovinskega monopola nad trpljenjem, čeprav, sodeč po izjavah nekaterih njihovih politikov, neredki med njimi menijo tako in verjamejo, da so izvoljeno ljudstvo.\n\nUpati je, da se bo sedanja zaostritev konflikta končala s čim manj žrtvami. Toda sledila bo naslednja zaostritev. In nato naslednja. Spet bo veliko mrtvih, spet bo veliko gorja. In vsakič bo nevarnost dodatne eskalacije konflikta in pljuska tega konflikta čez meje Bližnjega vzhoda. In to bo tako, dokler ne bo rešitve konflikta, ki bo vsaj kolikor toliko sprejemljiva tudi za Palestince.\n\nZaradi njene odgovornosti za nastanek izraelsko-palestinskega konflikta, zaradi njenega bogastva, in ker je to v njenem interesu, je Evropa najbolj poklicana, da se aktivno loti rešitve tega konflikta. Ne pa da reševanje konflikta povsem prepušča ZDA, nato pa za hrbtom ZDA poltiho pametuje o zgrešeni ameriški politiki. Nekdanja nemška kanclerka Angela Merkel, ki jo je Evropa dolgo opevala kot največjo evropsko državnico, je svojčas oznanila, da je obstoj Izraela za Nemčijo raison d'état. Čas je, da za Nemčijo in Evropo raison d'état postane rešitev izraelsko-palestinskega konflikta. To bi tudi bil jasen in konkreten korak v smeri evropske strateške avtonomije.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 20, "end": 28}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 106, "end": 115}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 124, "end": 142}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 238, "end": 245}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 281, "end": 590}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 321, "end": 334}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 461, "end": 590}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 597, "end": 691}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 597, "end": 844}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 635, "end": 651}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 671, "end": 691}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 991, "end": 1004}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1059, "end": 1067}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 1105, "end": 1222}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1106, "end": 1222}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1179, "end": 1182}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1251, "end": 1258}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1335, "end": 1353}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1487, "end": 1516}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1487, "end": 1506}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1520, "end": 1538}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 1697, "end": 1746}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1779, "end": 1791}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1844, "end": 1911}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1948, "end": 1968}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 2101, "end": 2140}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2101, "end": 2110}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 2178, "end": 2208}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 2376, "end": 2476}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2703, "end": 2872}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2960, "end": 3035}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 3038, "end": 3199}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 3203, "end": 3275}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3239, "end": 3254}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3327, "end": 3346}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3529, "end": 3541}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4861, "end": 4879}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 5452, "end": 5549}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5467, "end": 5482}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5895, "end": 6068}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5998, "end": 6009}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6014, "end": 6024}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 6071, "end": 6198}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6093, "end": 6104}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 6310, "end": 6372}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6476, "end": 6488}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6587, "end": 6597}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6723, "end": 6732}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6761, "end": 6813}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6789, "end": 6813}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6918, "end": 7094}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 6994, "end": 7094}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 7474, "end": 7482}], "article_id": "4454", "lang": "sl", "text": "Usodnost identitete mesojedca    \n\nV komentorskem terminu aktualnopolitične redakcije drugi teden zapored uzurpiramo eter z vegansko propagando, ki bo iz hladilnika v šestem nadstropju študentskega doma 14 v Rožni dolini enkrat za vselej pregnala meso. Pretekli teden je sodelavec Blaž Omahen napisal komentar z naslovom Floskulizacija prehranske politike. Izpostavil je, da so se predvolilne napovedi Roberta Goloba po redukciji porabe mesa in mesnih izdelkov izkazale za performans in da so politiki in političarke besedo snedli skoraj tolikokrat kot goveji stejk na protokolarnih večerjah. To, da se je predsednik vlade po prvotnem zelenem optimizmu kaj hitro skril v konformistično luknjo, ni rezultat uspešnosti živinorejskih lobijev, ampak dejstva, da je mesojedska svoboda za slovensko volilno telo ena od bolj identitetnih političnih tem.\n\nKmalu po tem, ko so slovenski mediji poročali o ustanovitvi premierovega strateškega sveta za prehrano, v katerem naj bi sodelovale tudi menda kultne veganke, se je na družbenih omrežjih in medijih začela prava histerija, ki jo lahko strnemo nekako takole: »Ojoj, Golob nam bo prepovedal meso, prisiljeni bomo v vegetarijanstvo in žrli bomo travo in Herbalife na njegov ukaz«. Tako močno razburjenje in paranoja, kot ju je sprožila le politično neuresničljiva napoved ‒ v očeh nekaterih veganska apokalipsa ‒ na Slovenskem nista prav pogost pojav. Ne gre namreč za ideološko motivirano odločitev, ki bi jo lahko uvrstili na ‒ v besednjaku mesojede predsednice republike ‒ desno-levi horizont, temveč je namera po tovrstnem zmanjšanju ogljičnega odtisa ena od bolj pragmatičnih in znanstveno utemeljenih.\n\nA kaj ko je meso v slovenskem kontekstu pač postavljeno na sam piedestal vsakdanjega življenja. O tem ne priča le lanskoletna mesocentrična zasnova košarice osnovnih živil, v katero je vlada med petnajst živil uvrstila tri vrste mesa in nobene vrste zelenjave ‒ meso je bistvenega pomena tudi v kulturnem imaginariju, ki ga kot slovenskega označujejo številne državne organizacije in akademska sfera s področja kulturne dediščine in etnologije. Ta obsedenost z mesom in živalskimi izdelki, ki se je nedavno materializirala v paranoičnem obrambnem mehanizmu, nikakor ne izvira iz okusa ali beljakovinske hranljivosti. Slovenska mesocentričnost ima globoke kulturno-zgodovinske korenine.\n\nNemara najbolj zgodovinsko oddaljen dogodek, ki je usodno vplival na splošno razširjeno uživanje mesa na Slovenskem, je pokristjanjevanje. Krščanstvo za razliko od ostalih abrahamskih veroizpovedi ali vzhodnih religij ne zapoveduje nikakršnih dietnih posebnosti, niti ne predvideva zakola živali po zapovedani metodi, kot sta košer v judaizmu ali halal v islamu. Sveti apostol Pavel je pri tolmačenju Jezusovega izročila dejal, da je kristjanom in kristjankam dovoljeno jesti karkoli, češ da jih je Kristus očistil od znotraj navzven. Edina omejitev mesnega prehranjevanja v krščanstvu velja na petke med postnim časom, krščanska verska etika te religije pa ima posledično največji ogljični odtis. Spreobrnitev slovenskega naroda v islam ali hinduizem, ki prepovedujeta uživanje svinjine oziroma govedine, bi bila izjemno blagodejna za šentflorjanski ekosistem.\n\nDruga pomembna razsežnost slovenske mesocentričnosti je razrednega izvora. V času, ko je ozemlju današnje Slovenije vladala avstroogrska gospoda, so večino slovensko govorečega prebivalstva predstavljali kmetje in kmetice. Meso je bilo na njihovem jedilniku izjemno redko, na krožniku so ga imeli nekajkrat mesečno ‒ uživanje ubitih živali je najpogosteje sovpadalo s krščanskimi prazniki. Prehrana živalskega izvora je bila zaradi materialnih razmer na podeželju pretežno v domeni aristokratskih slojev neslovenskega porekla. Meso je bilo ‒ poleg tega, da je imelo versko ali obredno funkcijo ‒ redka, visokorazredna dobrina, ki je obubožano kmečko prebivalstvo vsaj glede na vsebino krožnika približalo tuji aristokraciji. Po začetku prakticiranja intenzivne živinoreje in še izraziteje z ekspanzijo srednjega razreda v začetku druge polovice dvajsetega stoletja je meso postalo delavski simbol. Zaradi zmanjšanih neenakosti so mesne jedi postale najširše dostopne v menzah, vse pogosteje pa so bile na krožniku tudi doma, a še zdaleč ne vsak dan. Še danes si ni mogoče predstavljati sindikalnega piknika brez neomejenih količin mesa ali rudarske malice brez klobase in čebule na kosu kruha.\n\nMaterialne razlike so danes sicer večje kot v Jugoslaviji, medtem ko konsumpcija mesa še nikoli ni bila tako velika kot danes. Intenzivna živinorejska panoga ravno tako še nikoli ni proizvajala tolikšnih količin mesa, ki na račun mizernih življenjskih razmer živali za zakol z redkimi izjemami vsakodnevno romajo na krožnike. Zaradi razrednega popotovanja mesa od aristokratskega simbola, delavskih čevapov v omejenih količinah, vse do cenenih mesnih artiklov iz komaj živeče živine, meso danes velja za kapitalistični standard. Živali, ki so v Sloveniji z zakonom opredeljene kot čuteča bitja, niso nič drugega kot surovina, njihova telesa je moč v vseh možnih oblikah kupiti na vsakem koraku, okoliščine, v katerih so se do zakola redile, pa so na končnem artiklu neposredno omenjene, le če to koristi akumulaciji kapitala. Potrošniki so razbremenjeni vsakršne obzirnosti do produkcijskega procesa ‒ meso je posledično hedonistična dobrina, ki v nekaterih mesojedcih sproži čustveni odziv, če ti začutijo grožnjo, da je ne bodo več smeli konzumirati.\n\nK reprodukciji mesocentričnosti v slovenskem kontekstu je kakopak pripomogla tudi akademska stroka, ki je deklarirano tradicionalne mesne jedi za potrebe profitabilnega turističnega marketinga vključila v kanon slovenskosti. Kranjska klobasa, kraški pršut in prleška tünka so besedne zveze, ki so radikalno neločljive od koncepta slovenskosti, pa čeprav se od podobnih jedi drugih geografskih porekel ne razlikujejo drastično. Lahko bi rekli, da gre pri takšnem turističnem marketingu pod nadzorom etnološke stroke za mesojedski nacionalizem, ki folklorizira in romantizira okolju škodljive in krute prakse živinoreje. V pravni praksi je ta nacionalizem utelešen v mednarodnih tožbah o pravici do opredeljevanja določene hrane z nacionalno označbo. Umeščenost določene hrane v pravno-zakonodajni sistem tako ljudem jasno sporoča, kaj je naše in kaj njihovo, s tem pa reproducira Drugost v domačem in mednarodnem kontekstu.\n\nDružbena konstrukcija mesa v Sloveniji je pogojena z versko etiko, zgodovinsko razredno dinamiko in nacionalizmom, kar lahko razumemo kot vire politizacije mesa. Ob percipirani grožnji, ki je bila v bistvu samo jalov poziv, se je pričakovano razplamtel neke vrste kulturni boj brez kakršnekoli zdravorazumske podlage. Obrambni mehanizem nekaterih mesojedcev ‒ globoko zacementiranih v sovražno nastrojenost proti vegetarijancem in veganom, ker so ti izdali lastno nacionalno poreklo ‒ je zgolj posledica stoletja dolgih kulturnih vplivov. Ti so očitno premočni, da bi lahko v slovenski družbi prevladal konsenz, da je uživanje mesa glede na ogljični odtis enakovredno škodljivo izkoriščanju neobnovljivih virov energije. Nafte ali premoga ni moč zaužiti, a sta zaradi počasnega tempa zelenega prehoda v sodobni energetiki bistveno bolj pomembna za vsakdanjik kot meso. Brez mesa bi lahko živeli enako kvalitetno kot z njim, življenje brez neobnovljivih virov energije pa je v trenutnih razmerah utopična želja. Skratka: institucionalna regulacija konsumpcije mesa ni del identitetnih politik, biti mesojedec pa identiteta žal je.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 131, "end": 165},

"end": 10360}], "article_id": "4455", "lang": "sl", "text": "Moč seksapila ali zakaj se ljubimo vse manj?\n\nProti koncu leta hočeš nočeš delamo obračun pretečenih minut, ur, dni in mesecev, ki se vsako leto neustavljivo iztekajo. Obrnemo nov list papirja in novo leto je zopet tu. Trčimo ob minevanje. Seveda razmišljamo tudi o sreči. Indeks sreče se meri vsako leto. In kam se je v letu 2023 uvrstila Slovenija? Najsrečnejše države so bile po marčevskih meritvah ponovno Finska, Danska, Islandija, zatem Izrael, Nizozemska, Švedska, Norveška, Švica, Luksemburg in Nova Zelandija. Slovenija se je med 137. državami uvrstila na 22. mesto.\n\nIn kje najti razloge za srečo? Verjetno v splošnem zadovoljstvu, ki ga človek čuti v sebi. A čas, v katerem živimo, razoseblja, atomizira in ljudi lovi v številne pasti potrošniške družbe. Jasno je, kaj nas ubija in kaj izčrpava. Morda nas najgloblje osreči predana ljubezen, ki temelji na zdravi strasti, živahni spolnosti in občutenju obilja znotraj, ki žarči navzven. To žarenje se pogosto imenuje seksapil.  \n\nZakaj se ljudje ljubijo vse manj?\n\nVse več raziskav kaže na to, da libidinalne energije ugašajo. Je res, da ljudje seksajo vse manj? Seveda, če se človek bori za kruh, skrbništvo, kredite in tako naprej, ga mine prav vse … Tudi poželenje.\n\nA ne le to. Ženske postajajo podobne druga drugi, saj so modni trendi nagnjeni k siromašenju posebnosti. Moški pa, prestrašeni, ne upajo več igrati vloge osvajalca, saj se bojijo, da bi bili prehitro razumljeni narobe. Da nadlegujejo, ko bi želeli sporočiti naklonjenost. In da, vse več moških je kultiviranih in razumejo, da ne pomeni ne. A po svoje smo porušili ravnovesje moško-ženskega. Kličem k zdravi kmečki pameti.\n\nDrži tudi, da imajo številni odrasli moški fiksacijo čustvenega incesta z materami. Spolno se nikoli ne empancipirajo, osvobodijo. Za svoje težave pa pogosto krivijo ženske, ki da so \"frigidne\". Težava ni v frigidni ženski. Težava je v hladu \"dečka\" odrasle podobe, ki strastno in polnokrvno žensko s svojim nezrelim obnašanjem ohlaja. Reže tanke reze v njeno dušo, srce in telo.\n\nČe ga mati izpusti iz krempljev čustvenih transakcij, kar pomeni, da mu dovoli, da poišče svojo pot hrepenenja in se preizkusi v \"boju in ljubezni\", omogoči bodoči ženski, ljubici ali ženi, da ga spremeni v zrelega moža. Ne zaplete ga v boj nagonov po preživetju in samoohranitivi, saj ta spor vodi v duševno in telesno konfliktnost, navsezadnje pa v duševne motnje, ki se v populaciji razraščajo kot plesen.\n\nErotiko kot spoj čiste ljubezni, prepletene s poželenjem, zreli seksologi priporočajo kot zdravilno metodo holističnih posledic. Tako kot vitamin D blagodejno vpliva na imunost organizma, ki ga s sončnimi žarki ustvarjamo v telesu, terapija dotikov, besed in nežnosti ohranja zdrav nivo samospoštovanja in energijske samooskrbnosti. Saj veste, napajamo se drug z drugim. Ali praznimo. Včasih opazim kakšen par v gostilni in si mislim: uboga reva ali revež, s tem partnerjem se življenjska doba skrajša za 20 let. Bolezen zagotovljena.\n\nZadovoljna in zadovoljena Ona in On srečo delita z Vsemi. Sitni ljudje niso srečni. Zato sitnarijo.\n\nTorej ne samo iskanje služb, kreditov in ostalih bojev sodobnega potrošništva - \"krive so mamice\". Podobna dinamika velja za čustveno obremenjene odnose med hčerami in očeti. \"Krivi so očkoti.\" In prazni ljudje, če so premožni, zapravljajo. Trošijo. Grabijo na kup.\n\nZopet zmaga kapital. Ne duša. In ne srce.\n\nKljub ljubezni do otrok se pokaže, da ljubijo lastne otroke le kot podaljške sebe. Lastnega ega. Otroci svoje starše pogostokrat neusmiljeno izkoriščajo. Pozabijo na dolg, na vračanje prejetega …\n\nRes je, evolucija z ljubeznijo nima kaj veliko skupnega.\n\nIn starši nujno ne ljubijo svojih otrok niti otroci svojih staršev. Na svetovanjih marsikdaj priznajo, da če bi se odločali še enkrat, bi bili samski: svobodni, v odprtih zvezah, raziskujoč življenje. In omejujoče vezi ustvarjajo dodatne stroške, saj se jih ljudje pogosto ne morejo rešiti sami. Zatečejo se v razne izhode, tudi v bolezen.\n\nNamesto strastnega vikenda v dvoje ženske raje zavijejo v trgovino in si (če si lahko) kupijo pregrešno drago torbico in zopet zmaga kapital. In ne srce. Glava in ne duša. No, morda bi bilo bolje, če bi si omislile ljubimca ... Mlajšega, seveda, zakaj ne. Lotijo se tudi besednih vojn s seboj, sosedi, sodelavci … In ko se kopičijo le besede in besede, se ravnovesje poruši. Moški izberejo ali šport ali nov dokazovalni hobi. In ljubezen zopet iztrži \"krajši konec\".\n\nIn ljudje, ki se neprestano prepirajo (s seboj in okolico), ne zmorejo sodelovati. Ujeti vsak v svoj svet, vsak v svoj prav, ne koristijo niti sebi, okolici, še najmanj pa družbi. Ujeti v bolniške odsotnosti in novodobne subtilne bolezni, pri katerih sram pred frustracijami oblečemo v nove diagnoze, ki državno blagajno stanejo ogromno, lahko le upajo na boljši jutri.\n\nKje poiskati izhod? Morda v \"make love, not war\" (raje se ljubimo, kot vojskujmo).\n\nŽenska duša, seksapil\n\nIn kje stereotipno iščemo moč ženske? V energiji, vedenju, obvladovanju impulzov in v celoviti vibraciji, s katero zapolni prostor. Žlahtni šarm, ki se lepo poda jedri obliki, gradi nove svetove. Sophia Loren pravi, da je \"seksapil sestavljen iz polovice tega, kar imaš, in polovice tega, kar ljudje mislijo, da imaš\". Domišljija, ki izrisuje morebitne obrise, potrebuje prostor. In tiste, ki so ga sposobne izmojstriti v sebi, vladajo.\n\nVladajo najprej lastnim impulzom. Pogovarjajo se s svojo dušo in znajo stopiti v ozadje. Ker razumejo igro erotike senc in jasnih oblik, se uglasijo v premene lune in sonca. So kot zmes \"mane\", magnetično opojne in eterično nagovarjajoče domišljije moških, ki iščejo plodno zemljo, ki bi sprejela esenco njihove biti.\n\nMoški potrebuje odmev v ženski, ženska glas v moškem.\n\nTu seveda ne gre le za spolni akt, ki je le del zgodbe kreiranja novega, pa ne le fizičnega življenja. Ko ljubimo in smo ljubljeni, letimo na krilih srčnosti in svetu dajemo vse več in več, saj smo polni zanosa in prekipevamo od moči. Veliko več smo, kot bi bili, če bi potovali sami, vsak posebej in zase. V ljubeči erotiki se umi oplajajo, srca medijo, duše prižigajo in telesa stapljajo v novih ravneh zavedanja, ki je dano parom, ki stkejo globlje vezi. Gre torej za preplet umov, src in duš, ki soustvarja vizijo in s tem novo življenje, kar podrobneje opisujem v knjigi Pogovori z Erosom.  \n\nPotomci, biološka bitja genetike dveh, niso edini vrh evolucije. Moč preboja, idej, vizij in novih svetov, ki jih lahko moški sokreira ob polnokrvni ženski, je edinstvena. Zato imamo muze, ki arhetipsko nagovarjajo tisto najboljše v drugem.\n\n\"Strupofili\" in \"strupofobi\"\n\nVizionar je verjetno vsak, ki vidi obrise možnega in verjetnega. Podoba družbe in razvoja človeštva, ki ga nosimo v duhu kot primarno počelo delujočega, se manifestira v svetu zunaj nas. Vse se vselej prične z mislijo, pogledom in stališči. Vrednotami. Te so kompas, nevronsko omrežje, s katerim usmerjamo svoje odločitve in usode.\n\nČe bi se medsebojno bolj ljubili (dušno, srčno in ne zgolj telesno), bi bila potreba po vojskovanju, primerjanju in dvobojevanju izničena. A užitek vseh ni v ustvarjanju dobrega. In v nezdravi družbi se poleg strupenih odnosov bohotijo tudi spolni odkloni, delikti in prisilno vedenje, pri čemer se izgublja pridih zdravega razuma. Tako nekateri od strupa umrejo, drugi pa brez strupa ne morejo živeti. Moralni imperativ, ki je značilen za nepermisivne vzgojne prijeme, poskrbi za tvorne vrednote in se pri tem ozira na dobrobit celote. Sebičnost je kaznovana, moralna drža nagrajena.\n\nA sodobnost po tekočem traku bruha permisivne vedenjske obrazce tako mladih kot starih (sovzgajamo se celo življenje, z navadami vred). Turbokapitalizem nas s potrošniško družbo vred želi ohranjati odvisne od ničvrednih stvari in praks. Če nimamo znanja in izkušenj, imamo manko orodij, s katerimi bi lahko presojali in razbrali ter izbrali. Med prav in narobe. Med jaz, ti in vsi.  \n\nZato se v primarne družinske odnose v času permisivnih vzgojnih tehnik vnaša specifične frustracije, ki sprejo dva nagona: poželenje in nagon po samoohranitvi. Srečen, zadovoljen človek, ki ljubi in je ljubljen, ob izzivih vselej najde pot. Ne zanima ga le kapital, pač pa osebno zadovoljstvo.\n\nZato se ljubezen reducira na plehko zadovoljevanje potreb, erotiko pa na neokusno žarenje agresivnih moških in žensk, ki ne vidijo zanke, v katere jih vodijo pričakovanja, umetno ustvarjeni sodobni trendi, estetska industrija in plehkost potrošništva, ki gleda le na svoje žepe. In nepovezano človeštvo, sprti sosedje, jezni politiki in nezadovoljni državljani postajajo učno polje za peščico tistih, ki držijo nekaj niti v rokah.\n\nLjubezen, erotika in spoj src, umov in teles niso v korist kapitalizma. Pač pa v interesu strupofilov, ki imajo sicer zelo visok inteligenčni kvocient, a mrzle duše in okamenela srca.\nTudi ženske zlorabljajo moške\n\nDa ne bo pomote. Ne nadlegujejo le moški (si sploh kdo še upa ...), tudi ženske se lahko ogrejejo, dvorijo in se trudijo doseči objekt, razlog želje. Tudi moški so žrtve zlorab, a ženska oblikuje bolj prefinjene oblike izigravanja. Preko medija čustev in otrok, če so v zvezi, se sposobnost trženja koristi zviša. Ali pa se domislijo raznih psiholoških igric, v katere ujamejo moške s poškodovano samopodobo.\n\nIn ko ženska zlorabi mladega moškega (lastnega sina), se generacijski krog zlorab nalaga. Ko ga ne prepusti mlajši ženski (bodoči ženi), s sinom nikoli ne pretrga vezi, ki se morajo pretrgati, da bi se na novo stkale in omogočile, da se loči ljubezen dveh žensk: matere in žene. Ljubezensko-erotični naboj se takrat odpre, prelije in izgradi samostojno. V povedni avri partnerke, ki ju poleg srčne ljubezni in strasti druži numinozno, najdeta nov izraz sebe. Erotika, dotik svetega iz vsemirja, kjer se rojevajo otroci, ideje in novi svetovi, je gradilna ob zdravih roditeljih (lahko so tudi ločeni ali homoseksualni), ki prisegajo na zdravo kmečko pamet.\n\nIn zapomnimo si. Edinstvena in nezamenljiva prvina dobre erotike je ljubezen.\nKaj nam želim za leto 2024?\n\nDa bi se uigrali v celoto in začutili utrip duha prednikov.\n\nRazprtij je bilo več kot dovolj: dosti. Vsak naj ozavesti in prepozna lastni naboj, s katerim trga celoto. Veliko Velikih je hodilo po teh tleh pred nami.

Izrael je v odgovor silovito obstreljeval naselja na jugu Libanona, so po poročanju tujih tiskovnih agencij sporočili libanonski varnostni viri.\n\n17.20 Izrael na krepitev napadov Hezbolaha odgovoril s povračilnimi ukrepi\n\nGibanje Hezbolah, ki ga podpira Iran, je sporočilo, da je izvedlo šest napadov na vojaške postojanke na severu Izraela. Med njimi so vojašnica Biranit ter mesti Birket Rischa in Metula na Golanski planoti, ki si jo je priključil Izrael. Pri tem je po lastnih navedbah uporabilo rakete iranske izdelave.\n\nHezbolah je tudi sporočil, da so zadeli položaje izraelske vojske blizu vojašnice Zarit. Po navedbah izraelske vojske napadi Hezbolaha niso zahtevali žrtev.\n\nIzrael je odgovoril z napadi na jug Libanona. Po navedbah libanonskih varnostnih virov je izraelsko topništvo obstreljevalo obmejno mesto Kfarkila. Izraelska vojaška letala pa so izvedla zračne napade na obrobje mesta Jaron na jugu Libanona.\n\n15.35 Med sedmimi žrtvami izraelskega napada v Siriji tudi proiranski borci\n\nV izraelskem napadu na območje južno od sirske prestolnice Damask je bilo ubitih najmanj sedem ljudi, vključno s pripadniki iranske revolucionarne garde in proiranskimi borci iz Libanona, Iraka in Sirije, je danes sporočil Sirski observatorij za človekove pravice. Po navedbah iranskih medijev je bil tarča napada iranski svetovalni center.\n\n\"Izraelski napadi so bili usmerjeni na oporišče, ki je pripadalo Hezbolahu in iranski revolucionarni gardi, pri čemer je bilo ubitih sedem ljudi,\" je sporočil observatorij in dodal, da ni jasno, ali so med mrtvimi tudi civilisti.\n\nSirsko obrambno ministrstvo je medtem ob sklicevanju na neimenovan vojaški vir sporočilo, da so izraelske sile napad izvedle okoli 13. ure po lokalnem oziroma 11. ure srednjeevropskem času. Po navedbah ministrstva so med mrtvimi poleg \"več iranskih svetovalcev\" tudi civilisti, poroča francoska tiskovna agencija AFP.\n\nNeimenovani viri blizu sirskih vladnih sil pa so za nemško tiskovno agencijo dpa povedali, da so trije izstrelki zadeli kmetijo v okolici kraja Sajida Zeinab južno od Damaska. Kot so dejali, je \"sionistični sovražnik\" napadel iz smeri Golanske planote, ki jo od šestdnevne vojne leta 1967 zaseda Izrael.\n\n12.50 Palestinska uprava kritična do konference izraelskih naseljencev o ponovni naselitvi Gaze\n\nVeč sto članov in podpornikov skupnosti, ki se zavzemajo za širjenje izraelskih naselbin na palestinskih ozemljih, se je v nedeljo v Jeruzalemu zbralo na konferenci o obnovitvi izraelskih naselbin v Gazi ter njihovi širitvi na Zahodnem bregu. Palestinska uprava je dogodek označila za srečanje kolonialističnih terorističnih organizacij.\n\nNa konferenci z naslovom Naselbine prinašajo varnost so organizatorji med drugim razstavili zemljevid Gaze, na katerem so bile prikazane nekdanje izraelske naselbine na območju in lokacije, na katerih bi zgradili šest novih naselbin. Med drugim bi jih postavili na območju Han Junisa na jugu enklave in središča mesta Gaza, poroča izraelski časnik Times of Israel.\n\n\"Če bomo tam živeli mi, bodo oni živeli po naših pravilih. Še danes, ko grem od doma, se bojim terorističnih napadov,\" je dejala ena od naseljenk na Zahodnem bregu, ki podpirajo gradnjo izraelskih naselbin v Gazi, kjer izraelske sile izvajajo silovito ofenzivo.\n\nPalestinska uprava na okupiranem Zahodnem bregu je konferenco označila za srečanje kolonialističnih terorističnih organizacij. \"To srečanje in njegova agenda ponovno razkrivata pravi obraz desničarske izraelske vlade,\" je danes sporočilo zunanje ministrstvo v Ramali. Ocenilo je, da izraelska vlada zavrača sklenitev miru in raje vztraja pri okupaciji, kolonializmu in apartheidu, navaja nemška tiskovna agencija dpa.\n\nIzrael je po 38-letni okupaciji Gaze leta 2005 z območja umaknil svojo vojsko in naseljence. Izraelski premier Benjamin Netanjahu je napovedal, da njegova država po vojni ne namerava ponovno vzpostaviti stalne prisotnosti v enklavi. Ob tem je vrnitev naseljencev v Gazo tudi označil za nerealno možnost.\n\nVendar naj bi Izrael po njegovih napovedih kljub temu za nedoločen čas ohranil varnostni nadzor na območju. Mednarodna skupnost na čelu z ZDA je sicer Izraelu jasno sporočila, da morajo z Gazo upravljati Palestinci.\n\nPo poročanju izraelske televizije Channel 12 so se nedeljske konference udeležili tako člana skrajno desnih strank, minister za nacionalno varnost Itamar Ben Gvir in finančni minister Bezalel Smotrič, kot tudi 12 ministrov Netanjahujeve stranke Likud.\n\nBen Gvir na konferenci ni pozval le k vrnitvi izraelskih naseljencev v Gazo in na sever Zahodnega brega, temveč tudi k spodbujanju Palestincev k odhodu. Po njegovi oceni bi tako lahko preprečili pokol, ki ga je 7. oktobra izvedlo palestinsko islamistično gibanje Hamas.\n\n11.15 Izrael pariške pogovore o prekinitvi ognja v Gazi označil za konstruktivne\n\nIzrael je pogovore o morebitni novi prekinitvi ognja v Gazi in izpustitvi talcev v nedeljo v Parizu označil za konstruktivne. Pogovori, na katerih so sodelovali predstavniki ZDA, Izraela, Katarja in Egipta, se bodo predvidoma nadaljevali ta teden, poroča nemška tiskovna agencija dpa. Medtem nevladna organizacija Human Rights Monitor Izraelu očita, da si prizadeva stradati Palestince.\n\nIz urada izraelskega premierja Benjamina Netanjahuja so v nedeljo še sporočili, da med stranmi še vedno obstajajo določeni razkoli glede različnih stališč.\n\nPo poročanju časnika New York Times so v Parizu govorili o osnutku besedila, ki so ga pripravili ameriški pogajalci. V okviru predloga bi palestinske oborožene skupine izpustile več kot 100 talcev, Izrael pa bi v zameno omogočil prekinitev spopadov za dva meseca.\n\nSrečanja v francoski prestolnici so se med drugim udeležili vodja ameriške obveščevalne agencije Cia William Burns, vodje izraelskih agencij Mosad in Šin bet ter predstavniki Egipta in Katarja.\n\nV Gazi se medtem nadaljujejo spopadi, število smrtnih žrtev med Palestinci pa se še naprej veča tudi po odreditvi Meddržavnega sodišča (ICJ) glede sprejetja takojšnjih ukrepov za preprečitev genocida, je opozorila nevladna organizacija Human Rights Monitor. Ob tem so sporočili, da je izraelska vojska v 48 urah po odločitvi ICJ ubila najmanj 345 civilistov, ranila pa 643.\n\nPri organizaciji so še očitali Izraelu, da si prizadeva stradati Palestince. \"V nasprotju s sodbo najvišjega sodišča na svetu in v nasprotju z lastnimi mednarodnimi obveznostmi, vključno z mednarodnim pravom in načeli, Izrael vztraja pri hudih kršitvah, ki pomenijo vojne zločine in zločine proti človeštvu, vključno z genocidom nad Palestinci,\" so sporočili.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 104, "end": 123}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation",

"lang": "sl", "text": "Ko (anti)cepljenje neopazno postane del predvolilne kampanje\n\nNaj uvodoma povem, da ne sodim med t. i. »vernike v cepljenje«. A po drugi strani prav tako ne sodim v tisto skupino, ki cepljenju ostro nasprotuje iz kdo ve kakšnih znanstvenih in psevdoznanstvenih razlogov. V naslednjih vrsticah pa bom opozoril na nekaj drugega – namreč na dejstvo, da je cepljenje neopazno postalo del agende predvolilne kampanje pred naslednjimi volitvami, ki bi morale biti v rednem roku nekje maja ali junija 2022, vendar bi jih tranzicijska levica rada izsilila že letos, torej še v času slovenskega predsedovanja EU.\n\nVerjamem, da se vsi kolikor toliko dobro zavedamo, da živimo t. i. hiperiinformacijski dobi. Prav včeraj sem tako prebiral kolumno patra Branka Cestnika v novi številki Družine prav o tem, da velika količina informacij ter hitrost komunikacij prinaša nove pasti. Pisec tako opisuje stališče, ki ga je leta 2014 izrazil znani pisatelj Umberto Eco glede časopisa New York Times, ki v nedeljski izdaji bralce zasuje s takšno količino informacij, da jih ne more predelati, zato ostaja zmedeno in tudi vodljivo. Sam k temu dodajam, da je to danes temeljna značilnost sodobne družbe, kjer imajo tudi družbena omrežja svojo vlogo, še bolj pa dostopnost posameznika do širjenje svoje različice informacij. To je po eni strani dobro, a po drugi strani lahko ustvarja strašansko zmedo, saj je velikokrat zelo težko ločiti realnost od »fake news«. In to zadnje čase v veliki meri velja prav za cepljenje proti covid19. Dandanes preko facebooka, twitterja, maila in raznih blogov kroži ogromna količina informacij, ki Slovence osvešča o škodljivosti cepljenja, češ da gre pri cepljenju za načrtni genocid, ki pa ga seveda prikrivajo – a kdor bi sprejel cepljenje, bi bilo zanj prepozno. Ob tem se avtorji teh zapisov sklicujejo na znanost in na znanstvenike.\n\nKaj je res in kaj ni? Težko je reči. Ti članki lahko zvenijo zelo zelo prepričljivo. Opremljeni so z videoposnetki raznih tujcev, ki jih ne poznamo, dodani so razni grafi, podatki, mnenja, itd. Vsaj na prvi pogled ni mogoče zaznati, da bi bila v ozadju kakšna ideologija. Vendar pa vemo, da je lahko tudi znanost neke vrste religija, podobno tudi »anti-znanost«. Prav danes zjutraj sem tako v svoj privatni predal elektronske pošte dobil dnevno izdajo neke tabloidne spletne strani (Planet lepote ali nekaj podobnega). V njej je bila predstavljena cela vrsta člankov, med katerimi eden od zdravnikov svari, da bodo vsi, ki bodo prejeli kakršnokoli cepivo proti covid19, predčasno umrli. To še ni vse: eden celo navaja, da se necepljeni sploh ne bi smeli družiti s cepljenimi, ker bi lahko zaradi druženja utrpeli posledice in bi morda še sami postali neplodni. No, to je pa že norčevanje iz zdrave pameti, a sliši se še vedno zelo znanstveno in moramo pač temu verjeti, mar ne? No, čisto mimogrede, to objavlja portal, ki sicer stalno dela reklamo Marku Potrču, sicer velikemu ljubljencu tabloidov.\n\nVčeraj pa je v moj poštni predal prišel link do bloga (seveda je avtor anonimen) z zelo podobno vsebino, kot sem jo opisal prej. Le s to razliko, da je na koncu članka narejen tudi »dokazni postopek« o tem, da medijski mainstream v Sloveniji podpira cepljenje, torej genocid. Kot primera sta tu našteta dva portala: 24ur.si in nova24tv.si, oba pa naj bi zastopala interese globalistične elite, ki želi z masovnim genocidom zmanjšati svetovno populacijo. Če ne prej, mi je prav ob tem postalo dokončno jasno, da je vrag vzel šalo in da je nasprotovanje cepljenju že postalo del predvolilne kampanje. Za zdaj se to nasprotovanje širi preko neformalnih kanalov za »osveščanje množic«. Vendar ne vedno z znanstvenimi argumenti – tu in tam se najdejo tudi verski. Namreč, že najmanj pol leta do mene prihajajo različna sporočila z vsebino, kjer razni psevdo-preroški elementi opozarjajo na to, da je prišel čas odločitve in razločitve. Razločitve med tistimi, ki bodo sprejeli pečat zveri iz Knjige razodetja (beri: se bodo dali cepiti) in tistimi, ki bodo to odklonili. In seveda je jasno, da se bodo tisti prvi pogubili. Takšna sporočila so začela zadnje čase močno krožiti zlasti med aktivnimi katoličani, tudi kot odmev na dokajšnjo ravnodušnost vrha Cerkve (tako Svetega sedeža kot naših škofov) glede cepiv, med katerimi so tudi nekatera sporna, torej pridelana na osnovi abortiranih celic. Takšen primer je denimo AstraZeneca (na kar je pred časom denimo opozoril tudi dr. Janez Jurij Arnež) – in zanimivo je, da so bile največje težave z dobavo prav pri tem cepivu (in kdo ve, če ni tudi to izmoljeno?).\n\nPri vsem tem mi je zanimivo, da se največji nasprotni cepljenja obnašajo, kot da so bila cepiva izumljena šele sedaj in da se zadnjih dvesto let na tem področju ni zgodilo ničesar. Na Slovenskem je bilo prvo cepljenje organizirano že leta 1800 (!) in to proti črnim kozam. Verjetno je bilo cepljenje tedaj še precej bolj tvegano, saj medicinska znanost še ni bila tako razvita. Jasno pa je, da vsako cepivo prinaša s seboj tveganja, a nadaljnje širjenje covid19 prinaša še veliko večja tveganja. Gre za stoletno pandemijo, ki je prizadela cel svet. Bolezen sem prebolel tudi sam ravno za božično-novoletne praznike, sicer brez večjih težav, vendar nikakor ni bilo prijetno, kajti okrevanje v resnici traja precej časa, že »kitajski sev« je sprožil tudi številne druge zdravstvene težave, ki sicer niso neposredno povezane s simptomi covid19. Toliko o tem, da covid19 ne obstaja in da sem bil verjetno tudi sam zgolj namišljeni bolnik prav na vrhuncu praznikov.\n\nIn kaj bo naslednji korak? Verjetno se bo v naslednjih mesecih v naši državi pojavila kakšna nova politična stranka. Z »novimi obrazi«, ki bodo na zelo podoben način nasprotovali tako cepljenju kot proti ukrepom za zajezitev epidemije. In lahko ste prepričani, da se bodo pred temi »novimi obrazi« na trepalnice metali mnogi, ki so z velikim zaupanjem zadnje mesece požirali v celofan zavite razne polresnice in laži o cepljenju. Povedano drugače: razprava o cepljenju je že del predvolilne kampanje. Kajti oblast je treba vrniti v roke tistim, ki so zanjo »poklicani«, kot je pred skoraj pol stoletja v Splitu »predaval« Titov pribočnik Stane Dolanc. Ko bo delirij s cepljenjem minil in bo oblast prevzeta, bo prepozno – ker se bo pokazalo, da morebitna nova vladajoča elita v primeru, če bi oblast prevzela marca 2020, ne bi ravnala bistveno drugače od sedanje vlade. Le da bo spet izvajala politiko, kjer bodo davkoplačevalski denar spet usmerili v stare tokove, medtem ko bodo morali prejemniki covid-pomoči verjetno celo vračati nepovratna sredstva iz zadnjega leta dni. Jasno, ker denarja za »naše« ne bo dovolj. In to je vse bistvo kampanje proti cepljenju, ki smo ji priča. V resnici gre za še en javnomnenjski eksperiment v slogu inženirstva človeških duš. Za zadovoljitev oblastniških interesov tistih, ki se jim je oblast izmuznila kot »mokra žajfa« zaradi neposrečenega meta puške v koruzo…\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2359, "end": 2454}], "article_id": "4458", "lang": "sl", "text": "V okviru projekta trajne preselitve v Slovenijo prispela še druga skupina beguncev\n\nZa vsakega preseljenega begunca bo Slovenija prejela sredstva iz Bruslja\n\nV Slovenijo je v četrtek v okviru projekta trajne preselitve iz Turčije, v katerem se je država zavezala sprejeti 50 beguncev, prispelo še 27 Afganistancev, pretežno družin.

V okviru omenjenega projekta je 14. decembra lani v Slovenijo že prispelo 23 državljanov Sirije, štiri družine in posameznik.\n\nSlovenska vlada je 1. decembra 2022 sprejela sklep, s katerim je določila, da bo Slovenija iz Turčije sprejela 50 državljanov Sirije ali Afganistana, ki se jim lahko v Sloveniji prizna status begunca. Sledila je priprava izvedbenega načrta, v katerem so kot prednostne kategorije določili družine, matere samohranilke, samske ženske in do pet mladoletnikov brez spremstva, predvsem žrtve lanskega potresa v Turčiji.\n\nV projektu je Slovenija sodelovala z Visokim komisariatom Združenih narodov za begunce. Na podlagi njihove dokumentacije so predstavniki ministrstva, policije in Urada vlade za oskrbo in integracijo migrantov opravili pogovore z begunci v Turčiji o izpolnjevanju pogojev za priznanje statusa begunca v Sloveniji in integracijskih potrebah ter opravili varnostno preverjanje. Na tej podlagi so nato pripravili končni izbor tistih, ki izpolnjujejo vse predpisane pogoje in jim bo ob prihodu v Slovenijo takoj priznan status begunca.\n\nLeta 2016 se je v Slovenijo trajno preselilo 34 sirskih beguncev\n\nKot so še spomnili na ministrstvu, je Slovenija v preteklosti že sodelovala v projektu trajne preselitve, in sicer je bilo na podlagi sklepa vlade v letu 2016 v Slovenijo preseljenih 34 ljudi iz Turčije, vsi so bili državljani Sirije.\n\nSlovenija je v razpravah na ravni EU-ja večkrat podprla prizadevanja Evropske komisije v povezavi s trajnimi preselitvami in premestitvami. Ukrepi, povezani s trajnimi preselitvami, so namreč eden od pomembnejših elementov migracijske politike EU-ja.\n\nDržave članice lahko uporabljajo trajne preselitve kot pomemben element solidarnosti za zagotavljanje zaščite ljudem, ki potrebujejo mednarodno zaščito, in tudi kot strateški instrument, ki ga upravljajo migracije. S tem pomagajo zmanjšati spodbude za tihotapljenje in trgovino z ljudmi oziroma omogočajo tistim, ki potrebujejo zaščito, zakonito možnost poti v EU, so še navedli na ministrstvu.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 217, "end": 362}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 818, "end": 927}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 1025, "end": 1143}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1082, "end": 1143}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1277, "end": 1458}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1462, "end": 1662}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1570, "end": 1603}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1630, "end": 1648}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1871, "end": 2027}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2233, "end": 2249}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2905, "end": 2995}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3534, "end": 3551}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 3622, "end": 3647}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3802, "end": 3818}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4963, "end": 5041}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4999, "end": 5008}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5069, "end": 5077}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5235, "end": 5567}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 5416, "end": 5438}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5571, "end": 5876}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5715, "end": 5729}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5745, "end": 5751}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6030, "end": 6228}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 7077, "end": 7204}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 7297, "end": 7455}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 7335, "end": 7348}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 7458, "end": 7657}], "article_id": "4459", "lang": "sl", "text": "Notranje zadeve na čakanju\n\nPobuda za ustavno presojo člena o uporabi sledilnih naprav za sledenje blagu v noveli zakona o finančni upravi je na čakanju. Lahko bi jo podali že sami poslanci Gibanja Svoboda in Levice, ki so se predvsem zavoljo videza stabilnosti koalicije odločili novelo spraviti skozi državni zbor, četudi sami niso prepričani o njeni legalnosti. Vendar je premier Robert Golob tretjino poslanskih glasov pod pobudo javno zahteval še od Socialnih demokratov, da bi pokazal, kakor se je izrazil, da »so kot koalicija enotni, čeprav mogoče včasih tako ne izgleda«. Socialni demokrati so se odzvali, da podpisov ne namerava prispevati nihče od njihovih poslancev. Na pomoč koaliciji bi lahko priskočil kar varuh človekovih pravic Peter Svetina, ki je napovedal zahtevo za ustavno presojo novele še sam. Seveda to ne rešuje videza enotnosti in iskrenosti koalicije, saj obljubo lahko izpolni le tisti, ki jo je dal, torej Gibanje Svoboda in Levica.\n\nOdločitev Levice za podporo noveli zakona o finančni upravi, kot je ugotovil že Tomaž Zaniuk, pomeni, da se je Levica premieru in politikam največje vladne stranke povsem podredila. Tudi sicer postaja stapljanje Levice z ministrstvi, ki jih vodi, vsak dan vidnejše. Na ministrstvu za delo, ki ga vodi Luka Mesec, bi se po besedah državnega sekretarja Dana Juvana denimo pogovarjali o postopnem dvigu upokojitvene starosti, čeprav so pred državnozborskimi volitvami obljubljali nasprotovanje temu.\n\nZa razliko od Levice Socialni demokrati nadaljujejo s politiko, ki jo zagovarjajo že dolgo. Gre za politiko čistega pragmatizma in oportunizma, katerih največja moč je čista izpraznjenost vsake vsebine. Pri tem, da Socialni demokrati niso podprli novele zakona o finančni upravi in da ne nameravajo prispevati podpisov pod poslansko pobudo za ustavno presojo enega njenih členov, ne gre za načelnost stranke. Gre le za izrabo situacije, da bi bili videti načelni, v razmerju do Gibanja Svoboda pa pridobili pogajalsko orodje pri drugih vprašanjih, ki ostajajo odprta.\n\nRobert Golob je pred tednom dni ob reorganizaciji vlade po spremenjenem zakonu o vladi zatrdil, da so v državnem zboru končno potrdili vse ministre in ministrice, ki so bili predvideni že pred junijem. A trditev ne drži, saj notranja ministrica v reorganizirani vladi pač ni Tatjana Bobnar, ki je funkcijo opravljala le do 12. decembra. Notranje ministrstvo še vedno začasno vodi Sanja Ajanović Hovnik, sicer ministrica za javno upravo. Odprto vprašanje, pri katerem bi svojo besedo zagotovo želeli imeti tudi Socialni demokrati, je torej, kaj bo z notranjim ministrstvom in kdo ga bo prevzel. V imenu »enotnosti koalicije« Golob za novega notranjega ministra ali ministrico očitno išče podporo koalicijskih strank, tudi če bi novega ministra v državnem zboru lahko poslanci Gibanja Svoboda imenovali z navadno večino. Tudi zato Golob o novem ministru razmišlja tako dolgo. Na notranjem ministrstvu so medtem spremembe, ki jih je obljubljala Tatjana Bobnar, zastale.\n\nDanes poteče rok, ki ga je Sanja Ajanović Hovnik postavila vodstvu policije, da preuči poročilo izrednega nadzora nad delom policije pri varovanju protestov v času zadnje Janševe vlade in po potrebi izvede delovnopravne in druge postopke za ugotavljanje odgovornosti posameznikov. Kot so iz neuradnih virov izvedeli na časniku Dnevnik, zaradi ugotovitev nadzora nihče ne bo izgubil službe, prav tako pa nihče ne bo prejel opozorila pred odpovedjo. Policija naj bi po informacijah Dnevnika zgolj izrekla večje število blažjih opozoril. Čistka na policiji, ki je po zgodbi, kakor jo je ob odstopu predstavila Tatjana Bobnar, razlog, da je morala oditi, saj naj se ne bi želela podrediti političnim pritiskom premiera, se, kot kaže, zaenkrat torej ne bo zgodila.\n\nZgodba, ki je ob odstopu Tatjane Bobnar v medijskem viharju ostala neproblematizirana, pa je delo nekdanje, začasne in prihodnjih ministric na področju obljubljene spremembe azilne in migracijske politike. Pri tem se je Tatjana Bobnar vsaj deklarativno nameravala držati spoštovanja človekovih pravic in v največji meri napovedala upoštevanje priporočil nadzornih institucij, kot je varuh človekovih pravic.\n\nV poročilu za leto 2021 je varuh ministrstvu za notranje zadeve in policiji na primer priporočil, da zaradi preglednosti nad izvajanjem postopkov vračanja tujcev in transparentnosti delovanja policije vsaj bistvene ugotovitve monitoringa vračanja tujcev s spremstvom policije javno objavljata. Leto prej je varuh vladi priporočil, naj zagotovi, da imajo vsi iskalci mednarodne zaščite dostop do postopka mednarodne zaščite v skladu z mednarodnim pravom. Vsem pristojnim organom je priporočil, naj zagotovijo, da Republika Slovenija tujih državljanov ne vrača v druge države, ne da bi jim zagotovili postopkovne varovalke pred vračanjem, ki bi lahko vodilo v nevarnost kršitev njihovih človekovih pravic v državi, kamor bi bili neposredno ali posredno vrnjeni.\n\nV kratkem mandatu Tatjane Bobnar je resda prišlo do manjšega števila pushbackov beguncev iz Slovenije na Hrvaško. A notranje ministrstvo s pushbacki nikdar ni uradno prenehalo, ampak ga je k temu prisilila sprememba na hrvaški strani meje, kjer policisti redkeje od slovenskih kolegov sprejemajo begunce. Do uradnega odstopa od vračanja beguncev na notranjem ministrstvu ni prišlo kljub obljubam Tatjane Bobnar o spoštovanju človekovih pravic in kljub temu, da smo že predlani dočakali sodbo vrhovnega sodišča, ki je obsodilo ravnanje slovenske policije na južni meji kot kršitev prepovedi vračanja in kršitev pravice do azilnega postopka.\n\nV mandatu Tatjane Bobnar ni bilo premikov pri spremembi zakona o tujcih in zakona o mednarodni zaščiti, ki ju je Janševa vlada naredila dodatno diskriminatorna do tujcev, od famozne opredelitve pojma kompleksne krize na področju migracij do omejitve gibanja prosilcev za azil na občino začasnega prebivanja. V zakonu o mednarodni zaščiti prav tako ostaja določba, po kateri lahko prosilci prosto dostopajo do trga dela šele devet mesecev po vložitvi prošnje. O vsem tem in še mnogih določbah slovenskih zakonov, katerih odprava je nujna za pravično azilno in migracijsko politiko, je bilo že pod Tatjano Bobnar slišati izredno malo, od njenega odstopa pa nič.\n\nNa vladi se je pred dvema tednoma sicer prvič sestala delovna skupina za pripravo vladne strategije na področju migracij, ki jo vodi državni sekretar in eden neuradnih kandidatov za notranjega ministra Branko Lobnikar. Nova strategija ne napoveduje nič zares novega: zakonite migracije, učinkovito integracijo v družbo, preprečevanje nezakonitih migracij in učinkovite postopke mednarodne zaščite ob spoštovanju človekovih pravic. Ob strategiji pa so napovedali tudi spremembe zakona o tujcih. Po nujnem postopku bi spremenili zgolj nekaj administrativnih zadev na upravnih enotah, s tem pa naj bi omogočili hitrejše vodenje postopkov izdaje dovoljenj za prebivanje in potrdil o prijavi prebivanja. Kot so sporočili na ministrstvu, pripravljajo tudi spremembe zakona o tujcih, ki naj bi jih po rednem postopku sprejeli do konca letošnjega leta. Med po njihovem poglavitnimi rešitvami novele zakona niso omenili prav nobenega od področij, na katerih so rešitve najbolj nujne. Poglavitna rešitev je po sporočilu ministrstva že priznavanje poklicnih izkušenj tujcev.\n\nČe se zdi, da je zaradi koalicijskega merjenja mišic na čakanju novela zakona o finančni upravi, kaj je potem šele s spremembo azilne in migracijske zakonodaje. Posvetovalno telo za migracije, ki ga je na notranjem ministrstvu ustanovila Tatjana Bobnar z namenom izpolnitve obljub o spoštovanju človekovih pravic, se od njenega odstopa tako sploh več ne sestaja.  \n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 36, "end": 104}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 56, "end": 75}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 107, "end": 268}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 775, "end": 887}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1001, "end": 1013}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 1079, "end": 1469}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1298, "end": 1323}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1508, "end": 1621}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1625, "end": 1724}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1869, "end": 1937}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1869, "end": 1873}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1913, "end": 1937}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1940, "end": 1997}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2203, "end": 2224}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2279, "end": 2291}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2294, "end": 2469}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2772, "end": 2787}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3108, "end": 3130}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3297, "end": 3317}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3393, "end": 3413}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3440, "end": 3504}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3852, "end": 3979}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3916, "end": 3933}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3946, "end": 3979}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3982, "end": 4192}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4013, "end": 4028}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4131, "end": 4148}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4387, "end": 4582}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 4719, "end": 4802}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5031, "end": 5198}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5265, "end": 5375}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5327, "end": 5335}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5421, "end": 5569}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5481, "end": 5489}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5573, "end": 5698}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5701, "end": 5789}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5855, "end": 6017}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 6020, "end": 6135}], "article_id": "446", "lang": "sl", "text": "Ljubljana je Manila\n\nStranka Levica bo v kratkem dodala še en žebelj v krsto lastnih socialističnih načel. Tokrat bo brez vidnih pritožb in zadržkov svojega vodstva sodelovala in celo nastopala kot osrednji akter pri uvažanju poceni delovne sile s Filipinov v Slovenijo. To zveni kot slaba šala, vendar očitno vstopamo v pozno fazo centrističnega razkroja leve stranke, ko še najbolj absurdne domislice Levičinih kritikov ne dohajajo absurdnosti njenega dejanskega delovanja.\n\nMinister za delo, družino in socialne zadeve Luka Mesec bo predvidoma aprila v Manili na Filipinih podpisal memorandum o zaposlovanju tujih delavcev v Sloveniji. Temu bosta po standardnem postopku sledila še sklenitev sporazuma o zaposlovanju in sporazuma o socialni varnosti. Tako se bo Slovenija pridružila številnim drugim članicam Evropske unije, ki se že poslužujejo množičnega agencijskega dela Filipincev. Kot je pred slabim letom dni dejal predsednik vlade Robert Golob, naj bi bil glavni razlog za pridružitev v ta nečastni klub reševanje kadrovskega pomanjkanja na področju zdravstvene nege. Toda če bo Slovenija sledila trendom drugih evropskih držav, uvoz filipinske delovne sile ne bo omejen na potrebe ene panoge. Po sklenjenih sporazumih bodo Filipinci postali lažje dostopna delovna sila za širši spekter izkoriščevalskih interesov. V tej vlogi bodo lahko celo nadomestili manj razpoložljive delavce z Balkana, ki se zaradi boljših plač raje odpravljajo v druge evropske države.\n\nMesec in drugi predstavniki Levice so zaenkrat zamolčali dejanski položaj Filipincev, ki bodo v Slovenijo prihajali preko agencij za napotovanje dela – verjetno to počnejo v upanju, da jim ne bo treba posebej upravičevati lastnega političnega delovanja. Toda primer filipinskega dela je preveč kontroverzen za tovrstno pometanje pod preprogo. Tudi najbolj površna obravnava tega primera razkrije morje aktualnih zlorab, v njem pa zgodovino kolonialnega izkoriščanja, ki je ne moremo odmisliti pri obravnavi sodobnih realnosti.\n\nČetudi ni šlo za agencijsko delo, zametke sodobnih migracij filipinske delovne sile prvič najdemo v obdobju med letoma 1898 in 1946, ko so Filipini bili pod kolonialno oblastjo Združenih držav Amerike. Podjarmljeni Filipinci so predstavljali pomemben vir poceni delovne sile za kolonizatorko, ki jih je izkoriščala tako za delo na ameriških plantažah kot tudi za opravljanje storitvenih dejavnostih v domačih mestih, na primer za gospodinjsko delo ali za delo v hotelih. Ameriška kolonialna vlada je spodbujala njihove migracije tudi z uvajanjem amerikanizirane izobrazbe za filipinske zdravstvene delavke, kar je pozneje vodilo do rednega izvažanja filipinskih zdravstvenih delavk prek Pacifika. Kljub osamosvojitvi Filipinov od neposredne kolonialne nadvlade leta 1946 kolonialni režim izvažanja delovne sile ni bil odpravljen, temveč se je nadaljeval in okrepil v novih, neokolonialnih razmerah.\n\nZDA so v času hladne vojne ohranjale tesno politično in vojaško partnerstvo z nekdanjo kolonijo ter s pomočjo filipinskih kompradorskih elit zagotovile razvoj filipinskega gospodarstva v smer, ki je ugajala kapitalističnemu centru. Posebej pomembna za tovrsten razvoj so bila sedemdeseta leta 20. stoletja, ko je bila kot odgovor na lokalno nezadovoljstvo in rastoče komunistično gibanje uvedena proameriška diktatura filipinskega predsednika Ferdinanda Marcosa. Marcosova vlada ni le zatrla levičarskih upornikov, temveč je pod pritiskom z ameriškim imperializmom zlizanega Mednarodnega denarnega sklada pričela z uvajanjem vrste neoliberalnih gospodarskih reform, ki so utrle pot za trajno stagnacijo, zadolženost in perifernost Filipinov. Med reformami je bila tudi ustanovitev državnih uradov za napotitev filipinske delovne sile, ki so v sodelovanju s privatnimi agencijami pričeli z množičnim izvažanjem filipinskih delavcev.\n\nMarcosove reforme so pospešile, razširile, globalizirale in sistematizirale izvoz revne delovne sile za potrebe premožnejših kapitalističnih držav. Na njihovi podlagi je tovrsten kolonialni izvoz postal ena od osrednjih gospodarskih dejavnosti Filipinov, filipinski delavci pa tako eno od glavnih nizkocenovnih blag, ki jih Filipini proizvajajo za tuje države. Leta 2023 je vsota denarnih pošiljk filipinskih delavcev iz tujine znašala okrog 35 milijard evrov, kar ustreza približno osmim odstotkom in pol celotnega bruto domačega proizvoda Filipinov.\n\nČeprav napotitev filipinskih delavcev preko agencij na papirju deluje kot strogo regulirana dejavnost, obstoječe regulacije v praksi najpogosteje niso učinkovite pri preprečevanju zlorabe delavcev, ki ne poznajo pravnih postopkov zaposlovanja in poročanja prekrškov v tujini. Filipinski delavci, napoteni v evropske države, so tako po ugotovitvah raziskave, ki jo je leta 2021 pripravila nevladna organizacija Verité, izpostavljeni številnim tveganjem, zaradi katerih so lahko podvrženi tudi prisilnemu delu.\n\nDo tovrstnih tveganj pogosto pride že v začetnih fazah zaposlovanja delovne sile s Filipinov. Običajni so primeri, v katerih agencija delavce zaposli za opravljanje drugačnih delovnih obveznosti, v drugačnih delovnih pogojih ali za drugačno plačo, kot jim je obljubljeno ob podpisu zaposlitvene pogodbe. Enako razširjeni so tudi primeri, v katerih filipinska agencija zaračuna delavcu razne stroške za zaposlitev, ki delavca nato prisilijo v delo za odplačevanje finančnih dolgov. Nič bolje ne ravnajo evropski delodajalci, ki brez zadržkov izrabljajo šibek položaj tujih delavcev za nebrzdano podaljševanje delovnega časa, odtegovanje osnovne plače in neizplačevanje nadur.\n\nSkrajno naivno je pričakovati, da se bodo filipinski delavci, napoteni v Slovenijo, po čarobni poti izognili tovrstnim težavam, zlasti če upoštevamo že obstoječe zlorabe agencijskega dela v primeru balkanskih delavcev, na katere je nedavno opozoril tudi domači inšpektorat za delo. Še bolj naivno pa je pričakovati, da bodo socialistični sledilci Levičinih dejavnosti tihi, medtem ko stranka sodeluje v neokolonialnem izkoriščanju par excellence. Čas je, da se vodstvo Levice, zlasti pa Mesec, izjasni, kje stoji glede dejstev filipinske sedanjosti in preteklosti.\n\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 99, "end": 299}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 145, "end": 299}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 161, "end": 181}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 437, "end": 485}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 437, "end": 526}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 469, "end": 485}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 510, "end": 526}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 530, "end": 607}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 553, "end": 607}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 780, "end": 807}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 898, "end": 923}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 928, "end": 959}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1098, "end": 1171}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 1174, "end": 1331}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1209, "end": 1331}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1390, "end": 1474}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1737, "end": 1794}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 1798, "end": 1882}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1842, "end": 1882}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1871, "end": 1882}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2035, "end": 2137}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2142, "end": 2327}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2180, "end": 2288}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2209, "end": 2218}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2330, "end": 2435}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2355, "end": 2370}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 2441, "end": 2464}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2467, "end": 2530}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2550, "end": 2665}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 2643, "end": 2665}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2685, "end": 2874}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2790, "end": 2874}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2877, "end": 2978}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2981, "end": 3064}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3005, "end": 3064}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3035, "end": 3048}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3052, "end": 3064}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3069, "end": 3081}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3090, "end": 3334}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3121, "end": 3133}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3271, "end": 3334}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 3341, "end": 3520}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 3377, "end": 3520}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 3719, "end": 3767}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3734, "end": 3745}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3850, "end": 3915}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 3928, "end": 3980}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4009, "end": 4027}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4029, "end": 4152}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4113, "end": 4122}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4128, "end": 4152}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4225, "end": 4427}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4296, "end": 4427}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4299, "end": 4337}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4574, "end": 4722}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4616, "end": 4626}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4879, "end": 4886}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4987, "end": 5002}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5005, "end": 5134}], "article_id": "4460", "lang": "sl", "text": "Ameriški voditelj Tucker Carlson in ruski predsednik Vladimir Putin sta v Moskvi govorila dve uri. Zgodovinarji pa opozarjajo, da je bilo veliko Putinovih izjav popolnoma nesmiselnih in da lahko številne njegove trditve razumemo kot selektivno zlorabo zgodovine za iskanje izgovor za vojno v Ukrajini.\n\nPogovor, ki je objavljen tudi na omrežju X, je v nekaj urah zbral več kot 100 milijonov ogledov in je, kot so zapisali na CNN, zaradi Tuckerjeve prizanesljivosti in \"mehkega pristopa\" Putinu omogočil še eno propagandno zmago.\n\nBBC je sestavil seznam spornih izjav, ki jih je Putin izrekel med  intervjujem.  Putin je intervju začel s trditvijo, da je bilo leto 862 leto \"ustanovitve ruske države\", temu je sledilo polurno predavanje o zgodovini Rusije in Ukrajine. Carlson, ki je bil pogosto videti zmeden, je poslušal, ko je Putin obširno razlagal o izvoru ruske državnosti v devetem stoletju, Ukrajini kot umetni državi in poljskem sodelovanju s Hitlerjem. \n\nPutin je leta 2021 napisal esej s 5000 besedami z naslovom O zgodovinski enotnosti Rusov in Ukrajincev, ki je ponudil utemeljitev, ki jo je Kremelj izrabil  za svojo invazijo na Ukrajino manj kot leto kasneje. Zgodovinarji opozarjajo, tako BBC, da so trditve Putina nesmiselne in da jih lahko razumemo kot selektivno zlorabo zgodovine za opravičevanje vojne v Ukrajini. Pri tem opozarjajo, da ne glede na zgodovinsko realnost nobena od Putinovih trditev ne bi bila pravna utemeljitev za začetek vojne v Ukrajini. \n\nPutin je intervju začel s trditvijo, da je bilo leto 862 leto \"ustanovitve ruske države\". To je bilo leto, ko je bil Rurik, skandinavski princ, povabljen, da vlada mestu Novgorod, prestolnici Rusov – ljudstva, ki se bo sčasoma razvilo v današnje Ruse. Putin trdi, da je bila Ukrajina \"ustvarjena\" šele v 20. stoletju.\n\nZgodovinar Sergej Radčenko za BBC poudarja, da je predsednikova trditev \"popolna laž\" in da bi lahko na podlagi povsem enakih dokumentov in dokazov trdili, da je v 9. stoletju kot država začela razvijati tudi Ukrajina. Pri tem poudarja, da poskuša Putin uporabiti določena zgodovinska dejstva, ki bi zgradila pripoved osredotočeno na Rusijo. \n\nZgodovinar Ronald Suny pa dodaja, da  Putin ponavlja \"uveljavljeno mitologijo, ki so jo na določenih točkah v preteklosti sestavili moskovski carji, ki sledijo svojemu rodu vse do Rurika. Ta mitologija pa je bila izkristalizirana v Moskvi, da bi upravičila njihov imperialni nadzor nad Ukrajino.\"\n\n'Sodelovanje s Hitlerjem'\n\nZagotovo je bila Putinova najspornejša trditev v zvezi s Poljsko. Ruski predsednik je trdil, da je Poljska, ki sta jo leta 1939 napadli nacistična Nemčija in Sovjetska zveza, \"sodelovala s Hitlerjem\". Ruski predsednik je dejal, da je Poljska s tem, ko Hitlerju ni prepustila območja Poljske, imenovanega danziški koridor, \"šla predaleč in prisilila Hitlerja, da je z napadom nanje začel drugo svetovno vojno\". Zgodovinarka Anita Prazmowska poudarja, da so obtožbe, da so Poljaki sodelovali s Hitlerjem nesmiselne. Kot je poudarila, Putin zamenjuje 'diplomatski stik z grozečo sosedo s kolaboracijo'. \n\nUmetna država\n\nPutin je trdil tudi, da je \"Ukrajina umetna država, ki je bila oblikovana po volji Stalina,\" in trdil, da je Ukrajino ustvarilo sovjetsko vodstvo v dvajsetih letih 20. stoletja in  da je prejela ozemlja, do katerih ni imela nobenih zgodovinskih pravic.   \n\nKot za BBC pojasnjuje dr. Radčenko, je sovjetsko vodstvo začrtalo meje sovjetskih republik skoraj tako, kot so zahodne kolonialne sile začrtale meje v Afriki, bolj kot ne naključno. A kot poudarja, to ne pomeni, da Ukrajinci niso obstajali. Kot poudarja Radčenko, je vsaka država na nek način lažna država, v smislu, da so države ustvarjene kot rezultat zgodovinskega procesa. \"Če je Ukrajina lažna država, potem je tudi Rusija,\" pravi. \n\nAP med drugim opozarja na Putinovo izjavo o denacifikaciji Ukrajine: \"Nismo še dosegli svojih ciljev, saj je eden od njih denacifikacija. To pomeni prepoved vseh vrst neonacističnih gibanj v Ukrajini.\"\n\nKot poudarjajo pri AP, so ruski propagandisti vedno znova poskušali prikazati ukrajinskega predsednika Volodimirja Zelenskega kot neonacista ali nacističnega simpatizerja, čeprav je Jud in so trije njegovi prastrici umrli v holokavstu. Putin ni ponudil nobenega dokaza v podporo svojim ponavljajočim se trditvam, da radikalne, ultranacionalistične skupine v Ukrajini vplivajo na Zelenskega in imajo odločilen glas pri oblikovanju politike države. \n\nPrav tako opozarjajo na Putinovo izjavo o neuspehu mirovnih pogovorov: \"Takoj, ko smo umaknili svoje enote iz Kijeva, so ukrajinski pogajalci vse dogovore, dosežene v Istanbulu, takoj vrgli v koš in se pripravili na dolgotrajno oboroženo spopad s pomočjo ZDA in njihovih satelitov v Evropi.\"\n\nA pri tem se je treba zavedati, da so se ruski in ukrajinski uradniki marca 2022 v Istanbulu pogajali o začasnem mirovnem sporazumu, mesec dni po začetku invazije, a je hitro propadel. Medtem ko je Rusija umik svojih vojakov z območij blizu Kijeva prikazala kot znak dobre volje, je bil Kremelj očitno prisiljen umakniti se zaradi velikih izgub in logističnih težav med poskusom zavzetja ukrajinske prestolnice, še navaja BBC.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 23, "end": 28}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 262, "end": 318}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1359, "end": 1475}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 1478, "end": 1642}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 1674, "end": 1776}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1806, "end": 1986}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1836, "end": 1986}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1899, "end": 1928}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2002, "end": 2017}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2002, "end": 2029}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2132, "end": 2379}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2606, "end": 2671}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2661, "end": 2671}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2720, "end": 2750}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 2789, "end": 2887}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2853, "end": 2870}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3249, "end": 3253}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 3873, "end": 4041}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4181, "end": 4185}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4195, "end": 4211}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 4812, "end": 4854}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4966, "end": 4972}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5375, "end": 5379}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 5725, "end": 5846}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 5967, "end": 6142}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 6145, "end": 6516}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6163, "end": 6172}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 6216, "end": 6352}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 6356, "end": 6516}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 6816, "end": 6921}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 7053, "end": 7085}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 7064, "end": 7075}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 7079, "end": 7085}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 7109, "end": 7173}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 7550, "end": 7560}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 7573, "end": 7619}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 8004, "end": 8016}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 8109, "end": 8159}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 8313, "end": 8317}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 8441, "end": 8498}], "article_id": "4461", "lang": "sl", "text": "Izid vojne bo ogledalo zahoda\n\nPo napadu Hitlerja na Poljsko 1. septembra 1939, so Francozi dejali, da ne mislijo umirati za Varšavo. Leto pozneje so bili Nemci v Parizu.\n\nKo zadnje čase govorimo o popuščanju svetovnega interesa za osvobodilno vojno v Ukrajini, nastane nevaren občutek, da se bliža Putin svojemu uspehu, zahvaljujoč daljšemu trajanju vojne, kot pričakovano. Je res tako?\n\nPodrobne analize vojne od njenega začetka 24. februarja 2022 do danes nam pokažejo malo drugačno sliko. 24. februar 2022 me precej spominja na datum 22. junij 1941, ko je Hitler napadel Sovjetsko zvezo. Stalin takrat kljub intenzivnim premikom nemških sil v bližini sovjetske meje in celo jasnih opozoril zahodnih diplomatskih krogov ni dvomil v zavezništvo s Hitlerjem in tako popolnoma izključil slabe namene nacistične Nemčije. Tako se je izkazalo, da so bile vse pogodbe s Hitlerjem, od pakta o nenapadanju do mejne in prijateljske pogodbe, le v korist Nemčije, ki je ta čas, od 22. avgusta 1939, ko je bil sklenjen pakt Ribbentrop-Molotov, popolnoma izkoristila v svoje namene. Okupirala je vse važnejše evropske države ali z nekaterimi sklenila pogodbe o sodelovanju. Poleg tega jo je SZ oskrbovala s potrebnimi surovinami in živežem za vojsko, predvsem žitom.\n\nVzrok konflikta med Rusijo in Ukrajino se od tistega med nacistično Nemčijo in SZ bistveno razlikuje, a če svobodna Evropa ne bo ukrepala, bodo posledice podobne tistim, ki so nastopile po podpisu pakta 22. avgusta 1939. Kot je takrat Hitler hlinil podporo partnerstvu s Stalinom, tako je Putin do leta 2022 na zunaj prikazoval dobre odnose z zahodom kot znak dobre volje in partnerstva. In kako je to sprejel zahod? Vsi zahodni voditelji so prevzeli, pa naj mi ne zamerijo primerjave, vlogo Stalina po paktu s Hitlerjem. Zaradi božjega miru v hiši so Putinu oprostili Čečenijo, umore novinarjev, montirane procese proti političnim tekmecem, dušitev demokratičnega razvoja in na kraju še prilastitev delov suverene države Ukrajine.\n\nKo je Putin stegnil kremplje po Ukrajini, bi morali v zahodni Evropi in ZDA zazvoniti vsi alarmni zvonci. In kaj so storili zahodni politiki? Namesto da bi postavili Putinu jasne zahteve po vrnitvi prisvojenega ozemlja oziroma zahtevali rešitev pri OZN in postavili kratke termine in istočasno zagrozili z resnimi sankcijami, so v Minsku previdno potipali, kaj je Putin pripravljen sprejeti. Dogovori Minsk I in z dopolnitvami še Minsk II niso bili toliko vredni kot papir, na kateremu so bili napisani. Nastal je celo vtis, da je vrednost Putina porasla, ker je sedaj marsikaj odvisno od njegove dobre volje. Putin si je vzel veliko časa za premislek ob kavici s svojim prijateljem, nekdanjim nemškim kanclerjem Schröderjem. Ta, denarja požrešni socialdemokrat, je že trdno sedel v upravi Gazproma in prispeval svojo politično težo, da se je zgradil za Ukrajino škodljivi naftovod v Severnem morju. Čeprav sta bili pogodbi Minsk I + II za Rusijo boljša rešitev, kot za Ukrajino, se ju Rusija ni držala. Nasprotno, prizadevala si je ustvariti gotova dejstva, da se ruska prisotnost na tem področju utrdi. V ta prizadevanja je spadala tudi gradnja Kerškega mostu, s katerim so povezali polotok Krim z rusko celino.\n\nPutin je upravičeno dobil vtis, da Ukrajina zahod malo zanima. To se je utrdilo še s spodletelim poizkusom po zaslugi Merklove in Macrona, da bi postala Ukrajina članica Nata. Tako Putin ni videl nobene resne ovire, da pristopi h kompletnemu reševanju ukrajinskega vprašanja. Po že poznanem sovjetsko-ruskem vzorcu je pripravil načrt za vrnitev Ukrajine nazaj pod nekdanjo sovjetsko streho. Na zasedenih ozemljih je organiziral od mednarodne skupnosti nepriznane referendume za priključitev k Rusiji. Le te je potrdila ruska duma in 21. februarja 2022 je Putin tudi uradno razveljavil dogovore iz Minska. Ni treba biti analitik globalne politike ne vem kakšnega kova. Vsakemu, ki pozna ta redosled dogajanj, mora biti jasno, da je Putin načrtno pripravljal priključitev Ukrajine, seveda računajoč na še nadaljnjo pasivnost zahoda in Nata.\n\nKo je 24. februarja 2022 Rusija napadla popolnoma nepripravljeno Ukrajino, je na zahodu sicer zavreščalo, a ni bilo takoj jasno, ali bo zahod tudi to Putinovo krastačo zopet požrl ali ne. Šele odločna reakcija Ukrajine, da se bo branila s vsemi razpoložljivimi sredstvi, je bil povod za to, da je zahod ugotovil, da je sedaj na kocki njegova verodostojnost, kar se svobode in mednarodnega pravnega reda tiče. Nato in EU sta reagirali v korist Ukrajine, a vse preveč zadržano. To je upadljivo, če sedaj primerjamo z reakcijo ZDA in Nemčije ob napadu Hamasa na Izrael.\n\nTakšne podpore, kot jo je Nemčija izrekla Izraelu: „Podprli vas bomo z vsem, kar rabite,“ Ukrajina ni bila deležna. Nekako se je v evropsko zavest vgnezdila nerazumljiva zadržanost do Ukrajine, češ, če jim ponudimo prst, bodo hoteli celo roko. To je nerazumljivo ob vojaških strokovnjakih pri Natu in ZDA, ki vedo, kaj pomeni “povezana operacija”. Tega luksuza Ukrajinci niso poznali. Njihova sreča je bila v začetku vojne v veliki meri tudi ruska slaba taktika in prepričanje, da bo zavzetje Ukrajine bolj sprehod s tanki kot resno osvajanje. Vsaj Rusi so bili takšnih akcij do takrat navajeni. Odprto je tudi vprašanje, ali je ruska obveščevalna služba dovolj vestno analizirala dejansko politično stanje v Ukrajini in vzdušje med prebivalstvom glede Rusije.\n\nZahod, posebno še ZDA so zelo veliko storili za vojaško pomoč Ukrajini. Z obzirom na to, koliko milijard je bilo za vojno v Ukrajini že porabljenih, se nam odpre zanimivo vprašanje. Če nekdo toliko denarja investira v to vojno, potem bi upravičeno pričakovali, da bodo dajalci denarja skrbeli tudi za to, da bo ta naložba čim bolj uspešna. Se pravi, vsi bi morali skrbeti za to, da bo pomoč hitra, brez oklevanja, temeljita, se pravi, dobaviti se mora vse, kar je potrebno. Nasprotniku se ne sme dovoliti daljših premorov bojev, saj mu to omogoča, da se reorganizira in utrdi svoje položaje. Ravno zaradi zavlačevanja dobav je bila prekinjena jesenska uspešna štrena Ukrajine pri osvobajanju ozemlja in zaradi tega je bila ovirana potem pomladanska ukrajinska ofenziva. S to nerazumljivo cagavostjo zahodnih držav, ki sicer največ pomagajo, polzi Evropa v zelo nevarno fazo, ko bodo utrujeni Ukrajini začele popuščati moči in bomo postavljeni pred dejstvo pustiti Putina zmagati. To bi pomenilo nositi vse nepredvidljive posledice vključno z izgubo zaupanja v Nato ali pa bo ta na koncu moral sam poseči v vojna dogajanja, da reši čast zahoda.\n\nNemški diplomat Wolfgang Irschinger, nemški veleposlanik v ZDA in Veliki Britaniji, ki je od leta 2008 do 2022 vodil mednarodno münchensko varnostno konferenco, je pred nekaj dnevi zahteval večjo angažiranost zahoda v Ukrajini in povečanje pritiska na Rusijo. Tukaj se z njim popolnoma strinjam. Mnogi politiki svarijo pred neposrednim zapletanjem v ukrajinsko vojno, da ne bodo ogrožana naša življenja. To je razumljivo. Zato poziv k odločnejšemu nastopu še ne pomeni poziv k vojni. Ravno te bojazni se poslužuje zelo uspešno Putin pri svojem hazardiranju z zahodom. Kaj lahko storimo?\n– Neodgovorno je Ukrajini ne dobaviti orožja, ki je zelo učinkovito;\n\n– Nerazumljivo je od Ukrajine, ki je izpostavljena stalnim zračnim napadom, zahtevati, da ne sme dobavljeno orožje uporabiti na ruskem ozemlju. S tem se zagotavlja ruski vojski varno zaledje v neposredni bližini ukrajinske meje;\n\n– Ukrajina mora biti sposobna čim več prenašati vojno v Rusijo, da bi s tem slabila Putinov ugled, ker bodo Rusi občutili vojno na svoji koži. Neznosno je, da Rusija brez izbire bombardira v Ukrajini civilne cilje, ko pa ima Rusija prve žrtve civilistov, gre pred Varnostni svet;\n\n– Nato bi moral nuditi Ukrajini na njenem nezasedenem ozemlju tehnično in strateško pomoč. Rusijo pa opozoriti, da so tam Natovi vojaki in naj pri svojih napadih to upoštevajo;\n\n– Na ukrajinsko mejo bi morali namestiti močne Natove enote vključno z letalstvom. Potem pa pričeti Ruse tipati po diplomatskih kanalih.\n\nRuski problem je Putin\n\nRusija si ne more privoščiti vojne z Natom, pa tudi članice Nata tega ne želimo, potrebno pa je pokazati, da smo na vse pripravljeni. To bi zahtevalo zelo veliko taktiziranja in diplomatske spretnosti.

Odkrijejo neko težavo, za katero je veliko ljudi pripravljenih žrtvovati tudi demokracijo, samo da jo rešijo. Na Nizozemskem so to očitno muslimani, pri nas ilegalni migranti n komunisti.\n\nPolitična jesen ni vroča samo v Sloveniji. Nenavadnemu glasovanju v državnem zboru, kjer je sistem pri prvih 88 glasovanjih po dnevnem redu deloval v redu, pri 89. pa ne, naj bi botroval kozmični dež! Visokoenergentski delci iz najglobjih supernov iz samega začetka časa so na volitvah leta 2003 v okrožju Scharbeeck v Bruslju eni od kandidatk res pripisale dodatnih 4.096 glasov. Ali se je kaj takega zgodilo tudi pri nas ali ne, bo pokazala preiskava.\n\nMedtem je v Belgiji sosednji Nizozemski politično vreme postalo tako vroče, da so se čudovite peščene plaže severne Nizozemske začele taliti in se bodo skozi zimo najverjetneje spremenile v steklo.\n\n\"Tujci fuj, muslimani fej, nebelci kak\"\n\nV pregovorno odprti Nizozemski je na volitvah slavil Geert Wilders, ki je bil zunaj Nizozemske do pred nekaj leti popolna neznanka. Njegov politični program lahko povzamemo s \"tujci fuj, muslimani fej, nebelci kak in nam bo lepo\". Posebne intelektualne globine mu res ni očitati, toda ima tudi nazarensko srečo. Volitve so bile ravno v pravem trenutku in zaradi spopada med Izraelom in Hamasom se je dobršen del neodločenih nizozemskih volivcev odločil podpreti desničarskega skrajneža, da bo Nizozemsko branil pred muslimani.\n\nToda če malo odstremo tančico ksenofobije v idejah gospoda Wildersa, dobimo še marsikaj drugega kot \"tujci fuj, itd\". Kot vsak desničarski populist glasno zavzame stališče, s katerim dobiva glasove, toda v daljavi in skrito pred očmi se vodi povsem druga zgodba. Populistom nikoli ni v interesu rešiti težav, o katerih govorijo. Kot pri nas Janezu ni v interesu rešiti težav na naši južni meji, tudi Wildersu ni v interesu reševati težav, resničnih ali namišljenih, ki naj bi jih islam povzročil na Nizozemskem.\n\nPopulisti ogromno govorijo o težavah, rešujejo jih nikoli. Glavni cilj je odlepiti Nizozemsko iz okvira Evrope in vzpostaviti iliberalni režim v stilu Madžarske ali Rusije. Svoj načrt je jasno povedal: islam je trojanski konj. Pod pretvezo borbe proti muslimanskemu sovražniku bi prevzel nadzor nad državo in si jo podredil. Državo bi morda res zavaroval pred muslimani, toda v njej bi uvedel vse tisto, kar jim očita: fašizem, ksenofobijo, diktaturo in v končni fazi verjetno tudi apartheid.\n\nVoditelj pokloni, kar so želeli, in pobere, na kar niso pazili\n\nNe glede na to, kakšno mnenje imamo o odprtih vprašanjih sveta: ali smo za Ukrajino ali za Rusijo, za Izrael ali Hamas, za izložbene prostitutke ali spoštovanje žensk, se lahko strinjamo glede stične točke, ki si jo delijo. Namreč nobena izmed teh točk ne more biti pomembnejša od obrambe demokracije in svobode države, v kateri živimo. Najsi bo to Nizozemska ali Slovenija, Kosovirija ali Nikjerkoli, prva skrb volivcev mora biti, da bodo do naslednjih volitev imeli državo, v kateri je vredno živeti.\n\nPopulisti so povsod enaki. Odkrijejo neko težavo, za katero je veliko ljudi pripravljeno žrtvovati tudi demokracijo, samo da jo rešijo. V ZDA je to pravica do splava in nezakoniti priseljenci, na Nizozemskem so to, kot kaže, muslimani, pri nas ilegalni migranti in komunisti in tako dalje. Pred 90 leti v Nemčiji so bili to Judje. Zgodba je bila tudi tam prav taka in tista zmaga populistov je svarilo, kaj je končna faza populizma: podjarmljenje ljudstva tako, da jim voditelj pokloni, kar so želeli, in pobere, na kar niso pazili.\n\nNizozemska v resnici ni izvolila Wildersa, stranke, ki z njim nočejo imeti opravka, imajo gladko večino v parlamentu in malo verjetno je, da bo Wilders dejansko vodil vlado. Kljub temu je rezultat na volitvah vznemirljiv. Namreč, pregovorno odprta Nizozemska, znana po izložbah s prostitutkami, muzeju seksa in kajenju trave, država, katere grb glavnega mesta je postal mednarodno sprejet znak za pornografske vsebine, je največ podpore dala desničarskemu skrajnežu, ki zagovarja družinske vrednote in bi bil velik zaveznik kristjanov za boj proti islamu.\n\nVsaj dolgčas nam ni.\n\nKo pridejo na oblast, obrnejo ploščo\n\nBoj fašizma zoper demokracijo in mirno sobivanje je tako prešel v novo fazo, ki si je do sedaj še nismo predstavljali. Toda do sedaj smo ta isti film videli že tolikokrat, da ga znamo na pamet. Pred stoletjem in več nismo imeli zgodovinskega spomina, zdaj je le malo drugače. Vemo, kaj želi Wilders, vemo, kaj želijo naši populisti. Njihova igra je znana vsem, grožnja pa tudi. Govorijo in lajnajo o težavah, ki nas pestijo. Rešitev nimajo, so pa pripravljeni zatrditi, da bo pod njimi vse drugače in bodo rešili vse takoj.\n\nČe jim uspe priti na oblast, obrnejo ploščo. Težava, ki so jo do včeraj spremljali iz minute v minuto, je izginila in je nikoli ni bilo. Začnejo s prevzemom javnih ustanov z izbranci po strankarski liniji, stroko tako podredijo politiki, politiko pa osebnim interesom. Če je prva skrb volivca, da bo do naslednjih volitev še vedno imel državo vredno življenja, je prva skrb politika, da bo na oblasti tudi po naslednjih volitvah. Ta dva cilja sta lahko komplementarna in državljani moramo izbirati politike, pri katerih lahko zmagamo oboji.\n\nPri populistih se ta dva cilja med sabo izključujeta. Ali bo zmagal eden ali drugi, oba ne bosta. To je razlog, zakaj moramo na populiste gledati približno tako, kot zadnje čase gledamo na poplave: preprečiti je treba njihovo vrnitev. Tudi če moramo zato kdaj pa kdaj požreti kak kozmični žarek ali podobno bedarijo.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 0, "end": 24}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1, "end": 12}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 29, "end": 56}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 59, "end": 161}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 150, "end": 161}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 267, "end": 278}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1029, "end": 1046}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1262, "end": 1300}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1421, "end": 1433}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 1452, "end": 1598}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1540, "end": 1550}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1824, "end": 1951}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2065, "end": 2144}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2196, "end": 2202}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2374, "end": 2506}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 2508, "end": 2652}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2508, "end": 2652}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2571, "end": 2581}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2616, "end": 2639}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2699, "end": 2719}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2755, "end": 2778}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 3000, "end": 3100}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3181, "end": 3286}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3254, "end": 3261}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 3290, "end": 3433}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3360, "end": 3378}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3396, "end": 3413}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3534, "end": 3553}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3543, "end": 3553}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 3556, "end": 3821}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3583, "end": 3594}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3649, "end": 3659}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3726, "end": 3734}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3837, "end": 3847}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3872, "end": 4083}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3927, "end": 3938}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 4237, "end": 4338}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4301, "end": 4338}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 4341, "end": 4351}], "article_id": "4463", "lang": "sl", "text": "»Mokre sanje« Tanje Fajon in iluzije o »državi« Palestini\n\nKot veroučenec sem v prvem razredu prvič slišal za Palestino, kar naj bi bilo drugo ime za Sveto deželo. Gre pa za ozemlja, ki so zgodovinsko vezana na naselitev Izraelcev in tudi na Jezusovo delovanje, zato Sveta dežela sega v širšem pomenu na severu v Libanon in jugovzhodno Sirijo (vmes je Golansko višavje kot nekakšna »vmesna cona«), na jugu pa v vzhodni Egipt. Sicer pa poleg sedanje države Izrael (z vsemi arabskimi ozemlji) obsega še (zahodno) Jordanijo. Palestina, nekdaj imenovana tudi Kanaan, kot regija tako obsega območje med Egiptom, Sirijo, Savdsko Arabijo in Sredozemskim morjem.\n\nDa bi si laže predstavljali, v katero državo spadajo določeni svetopisemski kraji, naj pojasnim, da vzhodni del Jeruzalema, Betlehem, pokrajina Samarija in ozemlje južno od Jeruzalema (med Hebronom in Mrtvim morjem) sodijo pod jurisdikcijo t. i. Zahodnega brega, po arabsko upravo torej. Na ozemlju Jordanije je denimo gora Nebo, s katere je Mojzes tik pred smrtjo ugledal obljubljeno deželo, Betanijo onkraj Jordana, kjer je Janez krščeval, pa tudi Deseteromestje, skupino antičnih helenističnih utrdb vzhodno od reke Jordan, ki jih je obiskal Jezus. Verjetno ni naključje, da je bila že v Jezusovem času napol poganska Samarija zelo neprijazna do pravovernih Judov, medtem ko je bilo območje Gaze z okolico vseskozi domovina Filistejcev, ljudstva torej, ki se je trdo bojevalo proti Izraelcem. Vsi poznamo zgodbo, kako je deček David, ki je kasneje postal izraelski kralj, premagal zloglasnega filistejskega bojevnika Goljata (prim. 1Sam 17). Po imenu so Filistejci sicer povezani s Palestino, regijo, kjer dandanes v glavnem prebivajo Judje in Arabci. In dejansko so glede na kraj bivanja oboji Palestinci.\n\nIn mesto Gaza? V Svetem pismu je kar nekajkrat omenjeno. Znano je, da so tam Filistejci v ujetništvu zadržali sodnika Samsona, ki ga je malo pred tem izdala Dalila (prim. Sod 16, 21−30). Znano je tudi, da so vojskovodjo Jonatana iz družine Makabejcev najprej slovesno sprejeli v bližnjem Aškelonu. Vendar: »Od tam je odrinil proti Gazi, toda mestni prebivalci so mu zaprli vrata. Začel je oblegati mesto, požgal je okolico in jo oplenil. Mestni prebivalci so zaprosili Jonatana za mir. Podal jim je desnico, vendar pa je vzel sinove njihovih voditeljev za talce in jih poslal v Jeruzalem.« (1Mkb 11, 61−62) V preroških knjigah o Gazi praktično ne najdemo dobre besede: »Resnično, Gaza bo zapuščena in Aškelón bo postal pustinja …« (Sof 2,4) Skratka, gre za mesto, ki se ga že od pradavnine drži nekakšno prekletstvo in je doslej vedno predstavljalo sovražno pogansko utrdbo med Izraelci.\n\nZakaj naštevam ta dejstva? Predvsem zaradi mnogih zmot in iluzij, ki se dandanes širijo v javnosti o t. i. državi Palestini. Slednjo je šele leta 1988 razglasil vodja Palestinske osvobodilne organizacije Jaser Arafat kot nekakšno oživitev propadlega načrta OZN iz leta 1947, ki je predvideval razdelitev britanske Palestine med Jude in Arabce. Medtem ko so Judje načrt sprejeli, so ga Arabci odločno zavrnili, čemur je sledila državljanska vojna. Ob tem ni odveč omeniti, da je leto dni pred tem samostojnost dobila današnja Jordanija, ki je leta 1948 ob ustanovitvi judovske države sodelovala pri agresiji arabskih držav na Izrael.\n\nKaj je danes največja ovira za mir na Bližnjem vzhodu? Predvsem vpliv Hamasove propagande prek medijev in brezmejna naivnost mednarodne politike, ki noče videti resničnega ozadja npr. blokade bolnišnice v Gazi, kjer so pacienti v resnici talci Hamasove brutalnosti. Dokler bo namreč obveljala samomorilska logika, ki gradi na doseganju ciljev na vse ali nič (prek trupel lastnih ljudi!), in dokler se ne bodo palestinski Arabci odrekli terorizmu kot načinu doseganja ciljev, je vsaka razprava o mednarodnem priznanju Palestine odveč. Zato je tudi škandalozno, da zunanja ministrica Tanja Fajon na račun slovenskega ugleda sporoča svoje »mokre sanje« o priznanju Palestine, ob tem pa javnost med vrsticami prepričuje, da je treba oblastem v Gazi, ko poročajo o nasilju Izraela, verjeti na besedo. Prav tako je nesmiselno objavljati različne primerjalne zemljevide, ki kažejo na domnevno načrtno krčenje življenjskega prostora palestinskih Arabcev; ti navkljub mirovnemu sporazumu iz Osla (iz leta 1994) še vedno zase zahtevajo celotno območje Izraela.

Kot je povedal Fafangel, je pri sezonski gripi ta številka 1,3, pri eboli približno 2, pri covidu-19 pa trenutno ocenjujejo, da je ta številka 2,2. \"Želimo si, da je številka pod 1. Če je pod 1, se epidemija umirja. To smo dosegli že marca s hitrim padcem reproduktivne številke in trudimo se, da takšno stanje ostane tudi naprej,\" je povedal Fafangel. \"To je bolezen, ki se prenaša kapljično. Če bi bil prenos aerogen, bi to videli iz aviona, kajti bolezni, ki imajo takšen prenos, kot so ošpice, imajo reproduktivno številko okoli 15,\" je ob tem pojasnil Fafangel.\n\nPredstavil je tudi strukturo okuženih in umrlih s covidom-19. \"Za covid-19 so dovzetne čisto vse starostne skupine. Je pa res, kar se nakazuje počasi tudi v mednarodni strokovni literaturi, položaj nekoliko boljši med otroki,\" je povedal Fafangel in dodal, da je covid-19 zaradi svojih značilnosti najbolj tvegan za starejšo populacijo, po navadi polimorbidno, ki ima več pridruženih bolezni.\n\nKljučno je vzdrževanje fizične razdalje\n\nMed svojim nastopom je Fafangel večkrat poudaril predvsem na pomen fizične razdalje. \"Ta meter in pol, dva metra distance je nekaj, kar bomo morali vkomponirati v naša življenja za kar nekaj časa.\" Poudaril je tudi pomen higiene rok, kašlja, razkuževanja in pozval k čim manjšemu dotikanju obraza in sluznice. \"To so napotki, ki smo jih slišali milijonkrat, ampak mislim, da smo jih po vsem tem, kar smo prestali v teh treh mesecih, dojeli kot naše in tega se moramo res držati, da se lahko kot družba zaženemo naprej,\" je dejal Fafangel.\n\nDodal je, da so maske sekundarne v primerjavi z vzdrževanjem ustrezne distance. \"Tudi po priporočilih Svetovne zdravstvene organizacije so maske zelo relevantne, če smo bolni in če moramo nujno iz hiše ali če skrbite za bolnika. Maske pridejo v poštev, kadar ne moremo zagotoviti in vzdrževati fizične distance,\" je povedal predstojnik centra za nalezljive bolezni.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 18, "end": 31}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 35, "end": 81}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 86, "end": 156}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 159, "end": 174}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 177, "end": 182}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 362, "end": 376}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 677, "end": 723}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 711, "end": 723}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 726, "end": 874}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 892, "end": 941}, {"tag": "Red_Herring", "start": 1216, "end": 1342}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1285, "end": 1303}, {"tag": "Red_Herring", "start": 1345, "end": 1521}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1405, "end": 1434}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 1554, "end": 1573}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1605, "end": 1623}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1626, "end": 1705}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1630, "end": 1670}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1644, "end": 1670}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 1741, "end": 1751}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1763, "end": 1775}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1780, "end": 1794}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1799, "end": 1868}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1871, "end": 1953}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1956, "end": 2008}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 2014, "end": 2062}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2014, "end": 2089}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2056, "end": 2089}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2116, "end": 2130}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2320, "end": 2499}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2326, "end": 2341}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2532, "end": 2591}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 2594, "end": 2676}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2608, "end": 2630}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2636, "end": 2676}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2687, "end": 2709}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2815, "end": 2850}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2815, "end": 2825}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2904, "end": 2916}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2958, "end": 3031}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2996, "end": 3031}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3034, "end": 3199}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3202, "end": 3266}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3296, "end": 3375}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3378, "end": 3402}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3546, "end": 3562}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3565, "end": 3601}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3578, "end": 3601}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3604, "end": 3635}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3614, "end": 3625}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3679, "end": 3791}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3719, "end": 3768}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 3794, "end": 3878}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3828, "end": 3844}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 3881, "end": 4048}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4057, "end": 4066}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4081, "end": 4128}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4107, "end": 4128}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4131, "end": 4143}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 4222, "end": 4562}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4565, "end": 4580}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4637, "end": 4652}, {"tag": "Red_Herring", "start": 4656, "end": 5231}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5295, "end": 5311}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5333, "end": 5398}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5372, "end": 5398}, {"tag": "Red_Herring", "start": 5402, "end": 5499}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5519, "end": 5528}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5601, "end": 5630}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 5652, "end": 5755}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5740, "end": 5755}], "article_id": "4466", "lang": "sl", "text": "Nebo nad Gazo (in angeli pogube)\n\n»Opazil sem, da niste omenili končanja okupacije.« »Prosil sem vas, da postavite le še eno vprašanje, to bi jih bilo že več.

Srečno.«\n — Nerezidenčni izraelski veleposlanik Ze’ev Boker, ki je za Slovenijo pristojen z Dunaja, je v pogovoru za MMC TVS že šesti dan po Hamasovem napadu dejansko razkril izraelski peklenski načrt (13. 10. 2023)\n\n»V prejšnjem desetletju se je zgodilo. D o Sobotne priloge je prišla ekipa izraelskih diplomatov. Eden je prihajal z zunanjega ministrstva, dva sta prihajala z dunajskega veleposlaništva, ki ’pokriva’ tudi Slovenijo. Diplomat z Dunaja je po vljudni uverturi nastopil s konstatacijo, da je za Sobotno prilogo značilen antisemitizem. Da bi svojo osupljivo trditev podkrepil, je iz diplomatskega kovčka izvlekel zajeten dosje z odlomki besedil, ki so bila objavljena v Sobotni prilogi. ... V dosjeju, s katerim je opletal eden od izraelskih diplomatov, so bili zbrani odstavki o dogajanju v Gazi, objavljeni v Sobotni prilogi v drugem desetletju 21. stoletja. ...«\n — Ali Žerdin v Sobotni prilogi Dela o visokem izraelskem obisku v uredništvu časopisne hiše (4. 11. 2023)\n\n»Ali res obstaja zlo in ljudje, ki so zares zli?«\n— Dobri angel Damiel (Bruno Ganz) subtilno recitira Handkejeve verze v filmski mojstrovini Wima Wendersa Nebo nad Berlinom (1987)\n\nTudi pri nas smo, kot v večjem delu Evrope, te dni doživeli redek in izjemen naravni pojav, ki je intenzivno obarval nebo. Nemirno Sonce je proizvedlo tako imenovani severni sij. Tudi nad Gazo je že ves mesec nebo obarvano krvavo. A to ni naravni pojav, ampak delo človeškega zla. Žal z blagoslovom sprevržene politične Evrope in večjega dela »svobodnega sveta«. O. K., izhodiščno je bilo že vse neštetokrat povedano. Hamasov pokol je zavržno dejanje in izraelska država ima pravico do obrambe, do zavarovanja svoje varnosti. A tudi še tako intenzivna »pravična vojna« ne pozna in ne prizna pravičnih zločinov. Zločin je zločin, četudi ga povzročiš v imenu pravice. In Izrael včeraj, danes in tudi jutri izvaja zločine, ki jim v tem času ni para. V Ukrajini je prav tako velika klavnica, a civilisti niso cilj, ampak žrtve v omejenem deležu med pobitimi in ranjenimi. V Gazi ob sistematičnih napadih civilisti niso postranska škoda, ampak evidentno osrednji cilj napadov. In za to zločinsko raboto dobiva Izrael vso moralno, politično in vojaško podporo vodilne države »demokratičnega sveta«, evropska politika pa si sramežljivo zakriva oči, ušesa in usta.\n\nTako še enkrat kaže, da tudi zanjo ne veljajo dosledni standardi za primerljive situacije. Kar je denimo ruski zločin v Ukrajini, je izraelska sveta pravica do obrambe v Gazi ... Brez nepotrebne patetičnosti je treba dojeti, da sta obe aktualni vojni (v Ukrajini in Gazi), ne glede na to, kako se bosta iztekli, velik poraz Evrope in evropske ideje. Morda si bodo sčasoma na vojnih prizoriščih ljudje zalizali rane, pokopali mrtve, bolečina bo popustila, a združena Evropa s sebe ne bo sprala krvi, vonja smrti, sramote in krivde. Z redkimi izjemami (denimo Španija) sta odpovedali načelnost in avtonomnost večine posameznih članic združene Evrope, na čelu katere so najbolj zavržni vojni hujskači. Prva med njimi predsednica evropske komisije Ursula von der Leyen. Bilo je sicer nekaj kritik njenega ravnanja, pristranskosti, soliranja in legitimiranja izraelskega nasilja, a zares se ni zgodilo nič. Če odmislimo blago kritiko posameznih akterjev v sami komisiji in nekaj evroposlancev (med njimi, kot edinega iz Slovenije, Milana Brgleza), se ni zgodilo nič. Evroposlanci bolj čivkajo, kot lajajo, izraelska karavana zla gre dalje. Predvsem in pretežno nad nedolžne ljudi. Če kdo vendarle kaj poreče, ga aktualni fašistoidni in militantni (sic) Netanjahujev režim razglasi za antisemita. In zavezništva si ustvarja tudi z najbolj zavržnimi evropskimi politikami in politiki. Denimo v Sloveniji s tistimi, ki častijo in ob različnih komemoracijah polagajo cvetje in prižigajo sveče domobranstvu, ki je leta 1943 javno priseglo zvestobo Hitlerju. Če bi ekscelenca Ze’ev Boker, medtem ko na Dunaju sreba Kaffee mit Schlagsahne, malo poguglal, bi naletel denimo na pričevanja, kako so v noči z 11. na 12. september 1944 v hišo ljubljanske judovske družine Pollak prišli agenti te iste domobranske policije (torej vzorniki sedanjih največjih Netanjahujevih podpornikov, ki danes v Sloveniji izobešajo izraelske zastave v znak solidarnosti), njene člane aretirali in izročili Nemcem v sodnijsko-gestapovski zapor, od koder so jih poslali v Auschwitz in Mauthausen. Žrtve holokavsta se ob takih zavezništvih Netanjahujevega režima gotovo obračajo v grobu.\n\nWim Wenders je leta 1987, tik pred padcem železne zavese, posnel introvertirani, lirični film o angelih, ki sta se spustila z neba, kjer ne veljajo meje in prepreke, v takrat še razdeljeni Berlin. Imela sta zmožnost slišati tihe misli in čutenje ljudi. A ko se je angel Damien zaljubil v artistko – kje drugje kot na koncertu »berlinčana« Nicka Cava – se je moral odreči angelstvu in stopiti med smrtnike. Film je kljub melanholični poetiki izpričeval optimizem, vero v dobro in človeško. No, železna zavesa je kmalu nato res padla, a pregrade so še vedno in vse bolj prisotne. Denimo v Palestini. In z neba Gazo in celotno regijo motrijo neki drugi angeli. Kot kaže, sta prav Ismail Hanije in Bibi Netanjahu takšna angela zla, zlobe in pogube.\n\nNo, Wim Wenders pokaže, da odrasli ljudje angelov ne prepoznajo, ne vidijo, ne zaznajo. Otroci pač. Tudi in predvsem angele zla. In med pobitimi in ranjenimi Palestinci je daleč največ otrok. Tisti, ki se bodo izvlekli iz ruševin, ki bodo preživeli, večinoma ne bodo zrasli v mirovnike, ljudi dialoga in sožitja, ampak verjetno v še bolj neizprosne borce. Kaže, da je Netanjahujev režim v preteklih tednih zapravil še zadnjo priložnost za mir in sožitje med Palestinci in Judi vsaj v nedoločljivi bodočnosti, če že ne v realni prihodnosti. \n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 0, "end": 51}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2, "end": 18}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 54, "end": 161}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 190, "end": 197}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 201, "end": 209}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 339, "end": 360}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 380, "end": 497}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 399, "end": 415}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 670, "end": 772}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 799, "end": 812}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 820, "end": 979}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1159, "end": 1165}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1288, "end": 1332}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 1335, "end": 1360}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 1593, "end": 1755}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1782, "end": 1800}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1803, "end": 1812}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1815, "end": 1904}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 1907, "end": 2119}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2146, "end": 2411}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2162, "end": 2187}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2195, "end": 2209}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2212, "end": 2226}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2275, "end": 2295}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2414, "end": 2493}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2634, "end": 2812}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2919, "end": 3164}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2919, "end": 3258}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 3261, "end": 3319}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3322, "end": 3382}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3386, "end": 3532}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3536, "end": 3716}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3688, "end": 3860}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3688, "end": 3709}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3966, "end": 4070}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4016, "end": 4023}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4035, "end": 4052}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4092, "end": 4152}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4183, "end": 4419}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4197, "end": 4215}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4411, "end": 4419}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4534, "end": 4617}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4641, "end": 4648}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4666, "end": 4715}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 4883, "end": 5062}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 5065, "end": 5355}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5280, "end": 5287}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5340, "end": 5346}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5479, "end": 5658}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5484, "end": 5499}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5661, "end": 5782}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5786, "end": 5922}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5834, "end": 5841}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6191, "end": 6524}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6258, "end": 6262}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6527, "end": 6733}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6632, "end": 6643}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 6736, "end": 6801}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6783, "end": 6801}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6985, "end": 7004}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 7443, "end": 7522}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 7501, "end": 7509}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 7514, "end": 7522}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 7686, "end": 7701}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 7761, "end": 7776}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 7838, "end": 7906}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 7932, "end": 8046}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 8223, "end": 8274}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 8468, "end": 8486}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 8543, "end": 8738}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 8742, "end": 8786}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 8774, "end": 8786}], "article_id": "4467", "lang": "sl", "text": "S pokopom Palestine bomo pokopali še zadnje vrednote\n\nNihče se ne slepi, da bi Slovenija s konkretnimi ukrepi proti Izraelu ustavila izraelske načrte za Palestino. Lahko pa se zavzema proti genocidu.\n\nTrpljenje, ki smo mu trenutno priča v Gazi, je za večino od nas nepredstavljivo in neopisljivo. Prizori, ki jih skoraj v živo spremljamo, nas puščajo brez besed. Ob tem opazujemo politični svet, ki uničevanje v Gazi večinoma politično in vojaško aktivno podpira ali s tišino in pasivnostjo dopušča. Medtem ko gledamo starše v Gazi, ki svoje ranjene otroke iz bolnišnic nosijo v plastičnih vrečkah, ali novorojenčke, ki umirajo v inkubatorjih zaradi pomanjkanja goriva, večji del sveta – tudi EU, ki se tako rada hvali z vrednotami solidarnosti in demokracije – ostaja tiho. Zdi se, da je to zadnji žebelj v krsto, kjer smo dokončno pokopali človekove pravice, mir, mednarodno pravo in seveda vse, kar se je EU leta in leta želela pretvarjati, da je, pa smo že dolgo vedeli, da ni. Da je od človekovih pravic in solidarnosti v Evropi ostalo bore malo, je pokazal že politični odziv na migracije, danes pa jih je dokončno pokopal odziv voditeljev na izraelske masakre v Gazi. Leta in leta so nam prodajali vrednote človekovih pravic, demokracije in solidarnosti, a dobili smo neustavljivo gonjo po profitu, moči, nadzoru in uničevanju. Vojna se splača. Mir se ne.\n\nNenehno poslušamo politike, da je situacija v Palestini in Izraelu kompleksna, da je ne moremo razumeti. Zgodovinsko, politično in geopolitično situacija seveda ni enostavna, a popolnoma nerazumljiva tudi ni. Marsikdo vseeno ve, da je Izrael pred oktobrom 2023 že večkrat bombardiral Gazo, da je v teh napadih umrlo po več tisoč ljudi, da je življenje v Gazi zaradi izraelske blokade neznosno; marsikdo je že slišal o izraelski okupaciji, apartheidu, izraelskih napadih na palestinsko prebivalstvo in rušenju njegovih domov na Zahodnem bregu. Da je pred oktobrom 2023 obstajalo sistemsko in strukturno izraelsko nasilje nad palestinskim prebivalstvom in da v dogajanju med Izraelom in Palestino nikakor ne gre za dve politično in vojaško enakovredni strani. Predvsem pa mnogi vemo, da so izraelsko neustavljivo bombardiranje Gaze, stradanje ljudi, pobijanje otrok, uničevanje bolnišnic, od koder vojaki vlečejo na smrt ranjene ljudi, pač kadarkoli in kjerkoli nedopustno in nesprejemljivo – kot so bili tudi napadi na izraelsko civilno prebivalstvo. Vemo, da otroci nikoli ne smejo biti kolateralna škoda, kaj šele legitimna tarča.\n\nZato toliko bolj vzbujajo začudenje izjave svetovnih političnih voditeljev, ki smo jih spremljali ves ta mesec in pol, tudi v Sloveniji. Te izjave so bile pogosto nejasne, če ne že zavajajoče, predvsem pa so zelo redko direktno naslovile Izrael – ko je šlo za Hamas, voditelji z direktnimi obsodbami niso imeli težav.\n\nPredsednica države Nataša Pirc Musar je konec oktobra obe strani pozivala k prenehanju napadov, čeprav je Izrael tisti, ki je v samo prvih dveh tednih odvrgel na Gazo toliko bomb, kot so jih ZDA na Afganistan v enem letu, Izrael je tisti, ki je v dobrem mesecu pobil več kot 15.500 ljudi, Izrael je tisti, ki je v samo treh tednih pobil toliko otrok (po nekaterih podatkih več kot 6600), kot jih je v enem letu umrlo v vseh konfliktih po svetu. Tega ne dela palestinsko prebivalstvo in tega ne dela Hamas. Hamas je zajel talce, Hamas je izvedel napade 7. oktobra 2023 – če so se politiki jasno opredelili do teh dogodkov, kar so se, bi se morali jasno opredeliti tudi do tega, kar se je zgodilo zatem (in že pred tem).\n\nPogosto so bili nejasni tudi odzivi predsednika vlade Roberta Goloba in ministrice za zunanje in evropske zadeve Tanje Fajon, ki sta večkrat obžalovala humanitarno katastrofo v Gazi, kot da je ta posledica naravnih sil, ne pa izraelskega bombardiranja in prepovedi dostave humanitarne pomoči (in dolgoletne izraelske blokade). Čeprav sta opozorila na probleme kršitve mednarodnega prava in na nesprejemljivost palestinskih žrtev, nihče od njiju niti z besedo ni omenil nevarnosti genocida v Gazi in etničnega čiščenja na Zahodnem bregu, ne glede na to, da Izrael teh načrtov niti ne skriva in jih celo javno zagovarja. Z neprijetnim presenečenjem smo po mesecu izraelskega masakra v Gazi v medijih brali ministričine izjave na odboru za zunanjo politiko, kjer je precejšen poudarek namenila predvsem Hamasovim kršitvam mednarodnega prava, ker naj bi uporabljal bolnišnice za živi ščit – za kar, vsaj kot je bila javnost seznanjena, ni bilo verodostojnih dokazov, BBC je pozneje celo ugotavljal, da so bili dokazi izraelske vojske o Hamasovi bazi v bolnici Al Šifa verjetno prirejeni. Predvsem pa je zares tragično opazovati, kako politični vrh ostaja večinoma na ravni obžalovanja. Zlasti Tanja Fajon dobro ve, da ima na voljo tudi druge možnosti, saj je kot evropska poslanka leta 2019 celo sama pozivala k vojaškemu embargu in bojkotu Izraela.\n\nSeveda vsi vemo, da je Slovenija majhna in politično nepomembna država. Nihče se ne slepi, da bi Slovenija s konkretnimi ukrepi proti Izraelu ustavila izraelske načrte za Palestino. A to je nikakor in v nobenem trenutku ne izvzema od tega, da vodi politiko, ki je v skladu z ustavnimi načeli, in da se kot podpisnica številnih konvencij, med njimi konvencije o preprečevanju in kaznovanju zločina genocida, s konkretnimi ukrepi nenehno zavzema za to, da se genocid prepreči. Za to bi se lahko zavzemala tudi na ravni Evropske unije, pa čeprav je tudi vloga te na Bližnjem vzhodu praktično nična. Toda kazanje s prstom zgolj na ZDA in skrivanje za njihovo politiko, ki jo voditelji včasih celo javno kritizirajo, za vrati pa nato podpirajo, pomeni odrekanje lastne odgovornosti. Če zunanjepolitični predstavniki Slovenije menijo, da ni tako, potem se postavlja resno vprašanje, čemu jih sploh še imamo.\n\nIzjave voditeljev EU (in seveda ZDA) so še bolj šokantne, saj podpornih stališč do izraelskih kršitev mednarodnega prava niti ne skrivajo. Predsednica evropske komisije Ursula von der Leyen je s poudarjanjem neomajne podpore Izraelu pozivala k njegovi »dolžnosti« samoobrambe, po petih dneh neprestanega bombardiranja Gaze pa je v javni izjavi zapisala, da »bo odziv Izraela pokazal, kaj demokracija je«. Nemčija je novembra, zatem ko je Izrael zbombardiral sever Gaze in pobil več tisoč civilistov, prodajo orožja Izraelu še povečala, trenutno pa sprejema zakonodajo, po kateri bodo morali tuji državljani ob sprejemu nemškega državljanstva priznati pravico Izraela do obstoja (o pravici palestinskega prebivalstva do obstoja niti besede). Visoki predstavnik EU za zunanje zadeve in varnostno politiko Josep Borrell je dejanja Hamasa označil za vojni zločin, pri opredeljevanju do izraelskih dejanj pa se je skrival za pomanjkanjem pravnega znanja. Evropska in seveda ameriška podpora Izraelu je sveta, nedotakljiva. Samo sprašujemo se lahko, ali bo kdo kdaj za to podporo odgovarjal.\n\nTrenutno dogajanje je pokazalo tudi neizmeren razkorak med zahtevami civilne družbe in političnimi stališči in (ne)dejanji politikov. Pojavilo se je resno vprašanje, kakšna sploh je današnja moč civilne družbe. Na ulicah evropskih mest se je zbralo na sto tisoče ljudi, samo v Londonu skoraj 300.000, neskončno veliko je pozivov, peticij, akcij, protestirajo univerze, sindikati, kulturne institucije, na Nizozemskem pripravljajo tožbo proti državi zaradi prodaje orožja Izraelu. A pri vsem tem nič ne kaže, da bi to kakorkoli vplivalo na politična stališča voditeljev. Politični odzivi na tovrstne akcije se gibljejo nekje med represijo in ignoranco. V nekaterih državah proteste v podporo Palestini celo prepovedujejo oziroma so to poskušali, na primer v Franciji, Veliki Britaniji, Avstriji, Švici in Nemčiji (poskusi utišanja propalestinskih gibanj v Evropi sicer niso nekaj novega). Poskuse utišanja doživljajo tudi študenti in profesorji na univerzah. Drugje se politični predstavniki pretvarjajo, da civilnodružbenih pozivov ni. Tudi v Sloveniji, kjer se na vse pozive in proteste predsednik vlade in ministrica za zunanje in evropske zadeve nista odzvala niti enkrat. To ni značilno zgolj za trenutno dogajanje v Palestini, temveč se takšni odzivi raztezajo čez številna družbenopolitična vprašanja. Čeprav imamo na voljo mnogo mehanizmov in se politiki radi hvalijo z dialogom s civilno družbo (tudi če ta dialog ne prinese popolnoma ničesar), je vedno bolj vprašljivo, koliko vpliva civilna družba na politične odločitve sploh ima.\n\nPalestinec V. T. iz Jeruzalema (celega imena zaradi izraelske represije ne podaja) je novembra v svojem pozivu svetu zapisal: »Mi ne želimo, da nas osvobodite, temveč želimo, da osvobodite sebe od tako imenovane demokracije, ki jo imate, preden bo prepozno. Ne dovolite, da vam ljudje na oblasti odvzamejo to, da ste ljudje.« Jasno je, da bi ga morali vzeti skrajno resno.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 0, "end": 97}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 100, "end": 316}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 457, "end": 524}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 550, "end": 558}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 692, "end": 765}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 737, "end": 739}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 768, "end": 1034}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 846, "end": 862}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 914, "end": 1185}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 1189, "end": 1356}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1206, "end": 1356}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1228, "end": 1319}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1281, "end": 1291}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1482, "end": 1713}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1512, "end": 1524}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1528, "end": 1607}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1528, "end": 1538}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1541, "end": 1560}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1610, "end": 1636}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1638, "end": 1713}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 1716, "end": 1900}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1809, "end": 1824}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1878, "end": 1900}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1904, "end": 2202}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1941, "end": 1947}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1963, "end": 1981}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2027, "end": 2039}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2082, "end": 2096}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 2166, "end": 2202}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2227, "end": 2417}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2227, "end": 2388}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2293, "end": 2325}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2420, "end": 2563}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2516, "end": 2563}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2566, "end": 2669}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 2566, "end": 2669}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2726, "end": 2842}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2776, "end": 2824}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2857, "end": 2909}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2876, "end": 2889}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2945, "end": 2965}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2968, "end": 3025}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3000, "end": 3025}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 3079, "end": 3181}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3185, "end": 3292}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 3295, "end": 3378}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3328, "end": 3332}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3466, "end": 3515}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 3584, "end": 3676}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 3680, "end": 3736}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3680, "end": 3736}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3739, "end": 3893}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3772, "end": 3784}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3822, "end": 3830}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 3897, "end": 3978}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3981, "end": 4139}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4142, "end": 4243}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 4246, "end": 4315}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4273, "end": 4282}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4360, "end": 4414}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4369, "end": 4380}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4382, "end": 4390}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 4431, "end": 4504}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 4949, "end": 5135}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5013, "end": 5135}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5052, "end": 5068}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 5365, "end": 5525}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5424, "end": 5464}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5452, "end": 5525}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5489, "end": 5497}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5671, "end": 5901}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5684, "end": 5692}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5733, "end": 5741}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5771, "end": 5793}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5950, "end": 6146}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 6089, "end": 6146}], "article_id": "4468", "lang": "sl", "text": "Opozicija in mediji! Ljudem delate škodo, jih zavajate in usmerjate v nasprotovanje ukrepom vlade!\n\nPo 30. letih samostojne Slovenije ugotavljam, da je prehod v družbo, kjer lahko ljudje z različnimi interesi, s pomočjo političnih strank, oblikujejo družbo, kjer bo uveljavljena enakost in meritokracija, nerealiziran. Uspela nam je le samostojna država, kot osrednji projekt Demosa. To se je zgodilo zaradi enake volje 88 odstotkov udeležencev plebiscita. Kot član Demosa v skupščini Republike Slovenije 1990 -1992 poudarjam, da so bili preoblečeni komunisti v obleke Stranke demokratične prenove, Zvezo socialistične mladine in Socialistično stranko, skupaj z tedanjim predsednikom države, zaradi te volje ljudstva prisiljeni sprejeti boj za samostojnost Slovenije. Po drugi strani pa so z privatizacijsko zakonodajo, sprejeto po volji bivših “samoupravljavcev”,  po tem, ko je vlado prevzel dr. Janez Drnovšek, uspeli zadržati v svojih rokah velik del, prej družbenega premoženja, kapitala in s tem tudi največji del  politične moči. Posledice tega imamo danes. Pri nas je politični, kot tudi medijski  prostor, s pomočjo tega kapitala, neuravnotežen in še vedno močno nagnjen v levo.  Vsekakor je bilo politično ravnotežje, po 50. letih absolutne oblasti komunistov, z njihovo strahovlado pod okriljem tajnih policij, nemogoče uveljaviti brez lustracije. Te pa ni bilo možno izvesti, če smo hoteli vsaj kratkotrajno politično soglasje ob prizadevanjih za  samostojno Slovenijo. Naša družba je tako še danes “prestreljena” z dediči UDBE, somišljeniki partije, ki so v času komunizma uživali v privilegijih. To žele zadržati še naprej! To je tudi vzrok za odpor za nujne spremembe v pravosodju, medijih, šolstvu!\n\nPosledica dogajanj v začetkih 90. let je še vedno velika moč preko privatiziranega kapitala, politične levice in z njimi povezanih medijev, vključno z osrednjimi t.i. neodvisnimi mediji.\n\nV zadnjem letu sem tako rekoč dnevno zgrožen nad ravnanjem politične opozicije in osrednjih medijev ob pandemiji. Slednjo, leva politika in njej naklonjeni mediji, izkoriščajo v borbi za oblast. Pri tem jim življenja ljudi ne pomenijo nič. Ravnajo se po načelu: čim slabše za ljudi, tem bolje za nas.\n\nRTV in kulturni boj\n\nVse kar naredi strokovna skupina v borbi proti virusu in vlada za vzdrževanje gospodarstva nad vodo, da bi zagotovila vsaj kolikor toliko vzdržne razmere v državi, je v očeh opozicije, narobe. Mediji se ob tem potrudijo in dobe komentatorje, ki le kritizirajo, nasprotujejo ukrepom vlade, ne znajo pa predlagati drugačnih, varnih ukrepov. So proti nošenju mask, so proti zapiranju šol, so proti omejevanju gibanja, so za zapiranje gospodarstva. Kako si predstavljajo potem rešitve v času pandemije? Žal na RTV SLO niso sposobni kritične distance do neumnih, škodljivih trditev vplivnih posameznikov, tudi anonimnežev. Vtis je, da jim vsaka, še tako neumna kritika, trditev pride prav. Seveda je prav, da je oblast pod bujnim očesom medijev, ki pa se morajo zavedati, da je teža njihovih besed velika. Kot zdravnik sem iz ust bolnikov mnogokrat slišal, da so imeli za čisto resnico vse tisto kar so slišali na TV (“saj so povedali na televiziji”) ali radiu.\n\nTo seveda vedo uredniki in številni novinarji, ki so pravi družbeno politični delavci, kot v časih komunizma. Nikogar ne sme čuditi zakaj taka borba za mesta v Programskem svetu in Svetu RTV SLO. Gre za to, kdo bo imel moč vpliva in kako bo vplival na dnevno informativni program. Ta program je daleč od tega, da bi bil uravnotežen. To seveda ni mogoče zahtevati za medije, ki so v privatnih rokah, pri čemer pa mora biti lastnik ter s tem tudi njegova politična opredelitev, poznana javnosti.\n\nUradni podatki nasprotujejo ugotovitvam osrednjih medijev\n\nV nadaljevanju želim pokazati na izkrivljenost, neresničnost besed opozicije in na škodljivo (za varnost ljudi v času pandemije) ravnanje osrednjih medijev.  To je z lahkoto dokazati na osnovi podatkov WHO o delovanju držav v času pandemije. Pri nas opozicija, v velikem delu tudi mediji (vse do lanskega oktobra in v posameznih primerih še sedaj) vsak dan dokazujejo, da jim življenja ne pomenijo nič. Delajo vse, da bi sprovocirali, že sicer prisotno nelagodje med ljudmi in  njihovo nasprotovanje vladi. Slednja naj bi delovala z “represijo”, naj ne bi upoštevala stroke itd.\n\nDa bom konkreten z podatki o covid19, da prekinem manipulacije opozicije in medijev z zavajanjem, sem pregledal podatke na Our World In Data: Policy  Response To The Coronavirus Pandemic. Podatki za ves svet in tudi po posameznih regijah kažejo dejansko stanje ter časovno zaporedje sprejemanja ukrepov po državah od januarja 2020 do aprila 2021. Navedeni so: kot prvi indeks strogosti ukrepov v posamezni državi ter nato: zaprtje šol in gospodarstva, odpovedi javnih prireditev in zbiranj, omejitve gibanja, nošenje obraznih mask, koordinirano obveščanje ljudi, omejitev potovanj, testiranje in slednje kontaktov ter cepljenje.\n\nPozivam vse bralce, ki lahko to naredite, da si to ogledate, da vas ne bodo predstavniki opozicije in “neodvisni mediji”, kot je recimo RTV SLO, še naprej zavajali in z vami manipulirali! Samo za pokušino navajam le prvega od grafov pod naslovom: Government Stringency Index – to je ostrina ukrepov vlad v Evropi, ki zajema meritve devetih restriktivnih ukrepov v časovnem zaporedju od januarja 2020 do aprila 2021. S pregledom podatkov (premikanje kurzorja levo,  desno) se takoj in v celoti demantira vpitje levice in poročanje RTV SLO o represiji naše vlade v času pandemije.\n\nKratek pogled nam pove, da Slovenija v nobenem mesecu v letu 2020  ni imela najstrožjih restriktivnih ukrepov, kot tudi ne v letu 2021. Torej govorjenje o represiji je neverodostojno, povzemanje podatkov opozicije na nacionalni televiziji pa skrajno neprofesionalno in lahko predpostavljam tudi namensko; za ustvarjanje protivladnega razpoloženja med ljudmi, ki so v stiski.\n\nSpoštovani naslovljeni! Opozicija in mediji! Ljudem delate škodo, jih zavajate, usmerjate v nasprotovanje ukrepom vlade, s tem povečujete možnost večjega števila okuženih in umrlih in povzročate podaljševanje ukrepov, ki so neprijetni za vse!\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 0, "end": 37}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 0, "end": 140}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 22, "end": 30}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 271, "end": 285}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 398, "end": 506}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 509, "end": 567}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 538, "end": 567}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 624, "end": 648}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 707, "end": 724}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 809, "end": 923}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 843, "end": 854}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1130, "end": 1213}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1133, "end": 1146}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1162, "end": 1187}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1245, "end": 1393}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1255, "end": 1271}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 1310, "end": 1322}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1335, "end": 1344}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 1348, "end": 1393}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1411, "end": 1510}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1418, "end": 1432}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1513, "end": 1795}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 1661, "end": 1688}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1700, "end": 1707}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1741, "end": 1760}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1780, "end": 1795}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1798, "end": 1976}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1902, "end": 1917}, {"tag": "Obfuscation-Vagueness-Confusion", "start": 1948, "end": 1976}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2002, "end": 2026}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2041, "end": 2134}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2171, "end": 2208}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 2171, "end": 2180}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2240, "end": 2327}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2330, "end": 2347}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2330, "end": 2874}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2575, "end": 2592}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2687, "end": 2704}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2877, "end": 3032}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 2920, "end": 2999}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2978, "end": 2999}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3045, "end": 3079}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3093, "end": 3189}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3102, "end": 3106}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 3192, "end": 3258}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3220, "end": 3258}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3250, "end": 3258}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 3262, "end": 3469}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3525, "end": 3543}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3652, "end": 3673}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3705, "end": 3758}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3721, "end": 3758}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 3906, "end": 4156}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3929, "end": 3937}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3939, "end": 3959}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3984, "end": 4002}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4068, "end": 4101}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 4198, "end": 4286}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 4251, "end": 4286}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4289, "end": 4336}], "article_id": "4469", "lang": "sl", "text": "Levičarji podzavestno sovražijo Izrael, ker je šolski primer države, ki je skoraj propadla v socializmu in nato silovito uspela v kapitalizmu\n\n23-letni Ahmad Abu Murkhiyeh je bil mlad Palestinec z Zahodnega brega, ki je vedel, da mora domovino čim prej zapustiti, saj mu je grozila smrt – ne s strani Hamasa ali Islamskega džihada. Ubiti ga je hotela lastna družina, saj jim je priznal, da je gej. Palestina je poleg Afganistana in Pakistana ena najbolj zvestih dobesednih sledilk šeriatskega prava na svetu. Sveta knjiga je bila jasna – Ahmad mora za svoj greh umreti. Nekako se mu je uspelo prebiti do Izraela, kjer kljub splošnemu konservativizmu prebivalcev gejev ne preganjajo. Nato pa so lani njegovo obglavljeno truplo našli globoko na palestinskem ozemlju – v mestu Hebron, ki leži na Zahodnem bregu. Osumljenca so hitro našli, saj je obglavljanje posnel na video in ga naložil na splet, da bi se z dejanjem pohvalil. Šlo naj bi za znanca iz iste vasi, v kateri je mladost preživel Ahmad. Predvidevajo, da so vaščani mladeniča ugrabili v Izraelu in ga nato v Palestini umorili.\n\nZdaj pa previte film za dobro leto naprej. Po krvavem pokolu Hamasa, ko so nediskriminatorno pobijali in zažigali tudi dojenčke, so se sredi Ljubljane znašli slovenski skrajni levičarji in pred Prešernovim spomenikom vpili Alah je velik in kričali bojni krik: »From river to the sea, Palestine will be free« (konotacija je, da je »končna rešitev« izgon Izraelcev v morje, kar je tudi uradno stališče zdajšnje oblasti v Gazi). Isti ljudje, ki so še teden pred tem obsojali javne molitve, zastavice, ki so opozarjale na moralne posledice splava, in hodili po mestu z napisi: »Moja pička, moja odločitev!«, so poleg genocida nad Judi pozivali k ustanovitvi teokratske diktature, ki bi ji vladali brutalni despoti. Načela sodobnih levičarjev so kot plastelin. Da se jih zgnesti v poljubno obliko in vstaviti v različne ideološke kalupe, ne da bi se ljudje zavedali dihotomije lastnih prepričanj.\n\nZakaj je tako? Seveda gre tudi za sprenevedanje, a ne vedno. Včasih gre tudi za povsem navadno nevednost, ki ne vidi mimo starih dogem politike neuvrščenih. Zadnje čase sem veliko poslušal o apartheidu, ki ga Izrael izvaja v Gazi. Poslušal sem vprašanja tipa: Zakaj Izrael Palestincem ne pusti, da bi živeli v deželi, kjer je njihov starodavni dom?\n\nKo se jim pove, da arabski muslimani v Izraelu svobodno živijo in prosperirajo, delajo kot odvetniki, znanstveniki, imajo svojo arabsko stranko v izraelskem parlamentu, na vrhovnem sodišču pa tudi svojega predstavnika, bodo rekli, da je to laž. Ko se jim pove, da 200 tisoč prebivalcev Gaze vsakodnevno hodi v Izrael v (dobro plačane) službe, ne verjamejo. Ko se jim pove, da je Izrael skupaj z zahodnimi državami v Gazi zgradil ogromen tehnološki kompleks, ki je dal službo in denar marsikateremu mlademu Palestincu, rečejo, da to pa že ne drži. S pomočjo medijev so tako globoko zasadili fikcijo, da je Izrael Gazo spremenil v nekakšno različico nacističnega taborišča, da jih resničnost povsem šokira. Kako vem? Ko jim povem dejstva, ostanejo tiho. Vem pa, da v ozadju besno guglajo in se praskajo po čelu, medtem ko se jim svet, ki so ga poznali, razblinja. Priznali pa seveda ne bodo. Saj bo Izrael nagonsko njihov sovražnik.\n\nZakaj? Gre za edino bogato, demokratično in predvsem – izrazito tržno kapitalistično – državo na Bližnjem vzhodu, ki je nekoč pred davnimi časi poskusila s socialističnim eksperimentom in spoznala svojo zmoto. Izrael je prva leta svojega obstoja zasledoval cilje delavskega sionizma in graditve netržno orientiranih, samovzdržnih kibucov. Potem se jim je zgodila podobna hiperinflacija kot naši nekdanji domovini. Iz tega so se nekaj naučili. Danes je Izrael bližnjevzhodni izrastek ameriških sanj. Individualizem, trdo delo kot vrednota, osebna in podjetniška svoboda, lastnosti, ki so bliže temeljem nizozemskega kalvinističnega kapitalizma. Izrael je v podzavesti sovražnik slovenskih levičarjev ne zaradi Palestine in starodavnih povezav med Titom in Arafatom, ampak ker je zgodba, ki se je začela kot propadli socialistični eksperiment, nato pa je pot do bogastva naroda našla v kapitalizmu. Globoko v sebi naši levičarji vedo, da Izrael sovražijo, ker je šolska lekcija o tem, zakaj socializem ne deluje, kapitalizem pa. Oni so se iz lekcije nekaj naučili, mi vztrajamo.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 24, "end": 164}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 167, "end": 173}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 277, "end": 447}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 451, "end": 541}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 544, "end": 678}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 772, "end": 888}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 788, "end": 796}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 951, "end": 963}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1008, "end": 1016}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1824, "end": 1832}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1943, "end": 2018}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2065, "end": 2143}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2146, "end": 2295}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2333, "end": 2364}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2378, "end": 2388}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 2378, "end": 2488}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2378, "end": 2488}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2615, "end": 2678}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2718, "end": 2731}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2824, "end": 3213}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3405, "end": 3499}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3502, "end": 3544}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3899, "end": 4008}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4045, "end": 4064}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4448, "end": 4508}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4496, "end": 4508}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4512, "end": 4673}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 4512, "end": 4602}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4590, "end": 4602}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 4605, "end": 4673}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 4677, "end": 4822}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4872, "end": 4907}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5021, "end": 5067}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 5071, "end": 5232}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5098, "end": 5293}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 5321, "end": 5411}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5540, "end": 5702}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5945, "end": 5960}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6205, "end": 6378}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 6284, "end": 6378}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 6382, "end": 6469}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 6492, "end": 6552}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6574, "end": 6594}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6665, "end": 6732}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6860, "end": 6883}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 6886, "end": 7007}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 6941, "end": 7007}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 7021, "end": 7031}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 7407, "end": 7728}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 7473, "end": 7484}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 7681, "end": 7728}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 7759, "end": 7772}], "article_id": "447", "lang": "sl", "text": "Ženska, veš svoj dolg?\n\nSlovenke, ki so poskrbele za temelje, na katerih so zgrajeni naša sodobna družba, naše vrednote, naši pogledi, si zaslužijo posebno pozornost. Sijajno je, da se organizira vedno več posebnih razstav, dogodkov, ki osvetlijo te dele pozabljene zgodovine. Njihova dediščina in prispevki, ki so omogočili gradnjo današnje družbe, so tako obsežni, da bi si zaslužile lasten muzej, ki bi rastel skupaj z odkrivanjem novih dosežkov.\n\nNjihovih dosežkov, ki so temelj, na katerem ženske nadaljujemo s svojimi uspehi, je ogromno. In za mnoge se ne ve. So pozabljeni. In s tem je pozabljena polovica prebivalstva.\n\nZato se včasih niti ne zavedamo, kaj smo jim dolžni.\n\nČe pomislim na svoja šolska in študijska leta, lahko brez posebnega razmisleka ocenim, da smo se dosežkov prebojnih žensk – pisateljic, pesnic, slikark, arhitektk, družbenih buditeljic – dotaknili le površno.\n\nBolj kot njihovi ustvarjalni dosežki so se vtisnile podobe trpečih mater, mater neznanih junakov in žrtev, ki so se žrtvovale za družino, pri čemer pa njihovi resnični dosežki niso bili vedno ustrezno priznani. Mnoge so bile v pomembno oporo soprogom … In to v večjo, kot se morda zavedamo. A to ni bila njihova edina vloga.\n\nFranjo Tavčar denimo mnogi poznamo kot ženo pisatelja in politika dr. Ivana Tavčarja. Malokdo ve, da je bila med ustanoviteljicami Splošnega ženskega društva (1901), pozneje tudi njegova predsednica, od leta 1919 druga podpredsednica Narodne ženske zveze SHS, ki je bila del Mednarodne ženske zveze (I. C. W.), v kateri je bilo združenih 40 narodnih ženskih zvez s 36 milijoni članic. Leta 1918 je bila pobudnica velikega gibanja slovenskih žensk, v katerem so zbrali več kot dvesto tisoč podpisov v podporo majniški deklaraciji.\n\nAli pa Marija Maister, žena generala Rudolfa Maistra, ki je s svojo vojsko razorožil nemško varnostno stražo ter prevzel vojaško oblast v Mariboru. Kot predsednica Mariborskega ženskega društva je povezovala napredno misleče ženske in zahtevala volilno pravico za ženske.\n\nŠe manj znana pa je Marija (Horak) Murnik, narodna buditeljica in organizatorka dobrodelnih, prosvetnih in ženskih društev. V razprodani knjigi Pozabljena polovica, v kateri je zbranih 129 življenjepisov prebojnih slovenskih žensk 19. in 20. stoletja, je med drugim navedeno, da je leta 1870 zbrala \"okoli sebe četo slovenskih žen in deklet\" in se uprla blagohotnim moškim priporočilom za ukvarjanje žensk z literaturo, ki naj ne bi imela višjega pomena od zabave. Poročena je bila z Ivanom Murnikom, ki je v dunajskem državnem zboru zastopal kranjska mesta, ter z njim tudi politizirala, mu očitala neodločnost in neučinkovitost slovenskih poslancev.\n\nIn da ne pozabim znanstvenic, ki so premikale meje svojih znanstvenih disciplin v časih, ki so bili za ženske bistveno drugačni od današnjih. V letos izdani knjigi pri ZRC SAZU (zbrala Jovana Mihajlovič Trbovc) lahko denimo spoznamo 27 raziskovalk, profesoric, inovatork, avtoric, pomembnih zaradi znanstvenih prebojev, odkritij ali patenta, pa tudi znanstvenic, ki so v svoje znanstveno področje uvedle novo prakso in metodologijo, ustanovile inštitut oziroma oddelek ali pa vzpostavile pogoje za razvoj novih znanstvenih disciplin.\n\nKo prebiram življenjepise vseh teh prebojnic, začutim hkrati hvaležnost in nekakšen občutek dolga. Pomislim na slovenski prostor 19. in 20. stoletja, prostor znanstvenih disciplin, na to, kako pogumne so morale biti ženske takrat, da so se izpostavile in se postavile za skupno stvar.\nSmo tega ženske v Sloveniji danes sposobne?\n\nIslandijo je denimo Svetovni gospodarski forum (WEF) že 14. leto zapored glede enakosti spolov uvrstil na prvo mesto med državami na svetu.\n\nKo se je na Islandiji konec oktobra v znak protesta proti plačnim vrzelim med spoloma zbralo deset tisoč žensk in si je prost dan za ženske oz. kvennafri vzela tudi premierka Katrin Jakobsdottir, sem pomislila, ob kateri podobni dilemi ali izzivu bi se zbrale in korakale prebivalke Slovenije vseh barv in vseh prepričanj. Bi bilo to morda lahko v primerih nedopustnega nasilja nad ženskami in bi izrazile enotno neodobravanje nasilja? Bi morda lahko izpostavile problematiko zastopanosti žensk v medijih in poslovnem svetu ter zahtevale konkretno ukrepanje za doseg bolj uravnoteženih razmer? Bi lahko ustvarile močan glas proti vsakršnemu nadlegovanju, ne glede na to, ali gre za spolno nadlegovanje, verbalno nasilje ali druge oblike neprimernega vedenja?\n\nMorda smo tudi v Sloveniji nekoliko uspavani od zlate sredine.\n\nPo raznih kazalcih enakosti spolov se Slovenija namreč vedno uvrsti malo pred zlato sredino, zaskrbljujoče pa je, da na določenih področjih tudi počasi nazadujemo.\n\nEvropski inštitut za enakost spolov (EIGE) je v predstavitvi indeksa enakosti spolov 2023 Slovenijo z 69,4 točkami (od 100) razvrstil na 12. mesto (od lani smo izboljšali rezultat za 1,9 točke), a smo za 0,8 točke pod povprečjem EU. Glavni dejavniki povečanja celotne ocene so izboljšave na področju znanja (+ 4,7 točke) in moči (+ 2,8 točke), nazadujemo pa na področju časa, zdravja in dela.\n\nInštitut je tudi ugotovil, da je bilo leta 2022 med odločevalci v parlamentarnih odborih, ki so se posvečali okolju in podnebnim spremembam, le 13 odstotkov žensk, kar je bistveno manj od evropskega povprečja (30 odstotkov).\nKako močan je naš glas?\n\nŽenske v Sloveniji bi lahko našle skupno točko v boju za ozaveščanje o podnebnih spremembah. Statistični podatki nedvoumno kažejo, da smo ženske in dekleta ena izmed najbolj prizadetih skupin zaradi podnebnih sprememb. Kljub temu se naši glasovi v razpravah o podnebnih vprašanjih pogosto ne slišijo dovolj, kar vodi v oblikovanje politik, ki ne naslavljajo naših specifičnih potreb.\n\nLetos je bilo denimo le 15 voditeljic od 133 sodelujočih na podnebni konferenci Združenih narodov na COP28, domnevno prelomnem svetovnem okoljskem srečanju. Lani na COP27 je bilo od 110 svetovnih voditeljev in voditeljic le sedem žensk.\n\n\"Družinska slika\" voditeljev in voditeljic na letošnjem COP28 govori sama zase, ženske so predstavljale le 12 odstotkov govorcev.\n\nV nastopih domačih in tujih političark, odločevalk, mnenjskih voditeljic pogrešam ta močni glas opozarjanja. Včasih imam občutek, da voditeljice te teme ne želijo posebej izpostavljati, da se izognejo ocenam, da so histerične, da so preveč čustvene, da želijo nekaj, kar ženske že imamo, da se ponavljajo.\n\nPogrešam glas, ki bi spregovoril v imenu polovice prebivalstva, a v dobro celotne družbe. Glas, ki bi večkrat opozoril na podatke in dejstva, zaradi katerih izgubljamo vsi.\n\nV Sloveniji imamo edinstveno priložnost, da bo pridobljeno merilo moči v indeksu enakosti spolov pripomoglo, da se bodo izboljšale ocene tudi na področjih, na katerih nazadujemo. Prvič v zgodovini Slovenije imamo predsednico države, predsednico državnega zbora in zunanjo ministrico.\n\nVeliko odgovornost nosijo na svojih ramenih. Vse ženske računamo nanje, da bodo prevzele vodstvo in pripomogle k oblikovanju še bolj enakopravne prihodnosti za vse nas. Da ne bodo tiho trpele kot liki v Cankarjevih romanih, temveč jim bo zgled in opora množica pogumnih žensk iz naše zgodovine in sedanjosti.\n\nSvetujem jim, naj v svojih nagovorih ne izpuščajo osebne note in osebnih izkušenj. S tem bodo svojim nagovorom dodale globino in avtentičnost, ki bo nagovarjala javnost na bolj čustveni ravni. Pokažejo naj, kaj bi si želele spremeniti oziroma nadgraditi.\n\nZ osebnim pristopom in jasnimi pozivi k ukrepanju lahko postanejo gonilna sila za pozitivne spremembe.\n\nNaj ne pozabijo, da imajo veliko podporo in zaupanje vseh spolov, ki si želijo pravičnejše in enakopravnejše družbe. Računamo nanje, da bodo izkoristile to priložnost in se zavzemale za spremembe, ki koristijo vsem nam.\n\nDa ne bomo čakali zgolj na božične čudeže.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag":

Če bodo ljudje ostali brez spola (nisi moški, nisi ženska, nisi mama, nisi oče, ampak starš 1 in starš 2), nimaš svoje kulture, nimaš svoje zgodovine, tradicije, to vodi v razvrednotenje družbe. S tem, da se nimaš za nič več boriti, se ustvarja nek idealen potrošnik, ki bo zelo vodljiv, kar je agenda za gibanjem LGBTQ+. V SDM se ne borimo proti posameznikom, ampak agendi, ki je za njimi, in ki targetira najšibkejše, to je otroke!” je v oddaji Tema dneva pojasnila vplivnica Zala Klopčič. \n\nTelevizijska voditeljica Aleksandra Jug se je v tokratni Temi dneva uvodoma dotaknila dogajanja na zadnji Paradi ponosa. “Kdor ne pristaja na novorek progresivne levice, je deležen sovražnih izpadov. Na Paradi ponosa v Ljubljani se je znašla tudi majhna skupina oporečnikov. Sodeč po transparentu, ki so ga razvili v središču Ljubljane, ne pristajajo na novorek progresivne levice. Ko se je množica podpornikov agende LGBTQ+ sprehodila skozi center Ljubljane, so bili mladi oporečniki, med njimi tudi vzhajajoča vplivnica in predstavnica SDM Zala Klopčič, deležni sovražnih izpadov, zaradi katerih je morala posredovati policija,” je uvodoma dejala Jugova. Udeležence Parade ponosa je vznejevoljil transparent, na katerem je pisalo, da “obstajata samo dva spola”. Gre za preprosto resnico, ki jo je mogoče prebrati v vsakem biološkem učbeniku. Za resnico pa si je skupinica konservativnih protestnikov prislužila poplavo žaljivk in iztegnjenih sredincev.\n\nVse to so bili deležni od ljudi, ki se razglašajo za tolerantne, vse dokler se z njimi nekdo o nečem ne strinja. To je v nasprotju z načelom, da bi morala biti Parada ponosa prostor za izražanje različnih mnenj. Jugova je v studiu gostila Klopčičevo. Uvodoma jo je zanimalo, zakaj se je vplivnica udeležila Parade ponosa oziroma kaj so konservativni udeleženci na dogodku želeli sporočiti. Klopčičeva: “V organizaciji SDM smo se odločili, da glede na trenutne razmere v naši državi potrebujemo nekoga, ki bo kontriral tej sporni ideologiji LGBTQ+, ki prihaja k nam in se spravlja na najšibkejše, na otroke. Zato smo se odločili za akcijo “dva spola, ena resnica”, s katero želimo vse opozoriti na najbolj očitno, naravno, biološko dejstvo – to, da obstajata samo dva spola.” Ne glede na to, da nekateri ljudje osnovnih naravnih zakonitostih ne sprejmejo, se morajo po njenem mladi še posebej boriti proti temu.\n\nKot je v nadaljevanju spomnila TV-voditeljica, parada poteka že vrsto let, vendar pa v preteklosti ni imela takšnega predznaka, kot ga ima dandanes. Tudi po opažanju Klopčičeve se izvorno gibanje precej razlikuje od tega, kar LGBTQ+ predstavlja danes. V začetku so se aktivisti borili za pravice homoseksualcev, ki so bili pred desetletji nekoč v resnici zaznamovani in zatirani, vendar pa današnje gibanje očitno odstopa od izvirnika. Aktivisti, ki jih na paradi vidimo danes, se borijo za nekaj popolnoma drugega. Klopčičeva je ob tem poudarila, da so mladi konservativci k akciji pristopili “zelo mirno”. “Če lahko oni izrazijo svoje mnenje, ga lahko tudi mi!” je prepričana. V ta namen so prinesli transparent z napisom “obstajata samo dva spola”, mišljena pa sta moški in ženski. S strani udeležencev dogodka so doživeli veliko mero zaničevanja in upora, vanje so celo metali steklenice, plastenke, kar je tudi posneto. Klopčičevi se je celo približalo neko dekle in vanjo metalo prah, k sreči pa so posredovali policisti.\n\n“Takšna naklonjenost Pirc Musar skupini, ki targetira najšibkejše, je nedopustna in zelo sporna!”\n\n“Na tem mestu, bi se policistom tudi zahvalila, da so nas zaščitili s svojimi telesi, sicer se vsi ne bi celi vrnili domov.” Po mnenju Jugove je zadeva precej nenavadna, saj si prav udeleženci Parade prizadevajo za “sprejemanje in toleranco”. Po drugi strani pa so tako netolerantni do drugače mislečih … Klopčičeva pa je še dejala, da so jih napadali celo po socialnih omrežjih in jih obtoževali nasilja, čeprav so izredno pazili, da ne bi prišlo do kakršnega koli fizičnega konflikta. Jugova je spomnila, da se je paradi pridružil tudi slovenski politični vrh. “To strogo obsojamo. Tudi na ljubljanski mestni hiši visi zastava, predsednica republike Nataša Pirc Musar pa ne skriva svoje naklonjenosti skupini LGBTQ+. Zelo smo razočarani nad tem. Nekdo, ki je na takšnem mestu, bi moral predstavljati vse. Takšna naklonjenost skupini, ki neposredno targetira najšibkejše, torej otroke, ki dopuščajo možnost, da si 12-letnica sama izbere spol, je nedopustna in zelo sporna!” je bila ostra Klopčičeva.\n\n“In to bi morali ljudje na visokih političnih funkcijah, kot je predsednik vlade, predsednica države, predsednica državnega zbora, strogo obsoditi. Na žalost pa je situacija v Sloveniji ravno obratna!” Novinarka pa je v nadaljevanju spomnila na otroke, ki so bili na dogodku prisotni in celo našemljeni v “skorajda sadomazo slogu”. Vplivnica je bilo šokirana, ko je v množici zbranih videla tako našemljene otroke. Pojavljali so se tudi mladoletniki s čudaškimi napisi “Za otroke in družine gre”, kar je bila verjetno provokacija, namenjena Alešu Primcu. Te prizori so bili zanjo zastrašujoči zlasti ob dejstvu, da tudi v Sloveniji že prirejajo dogodke za najmlajše, kakršne smo doslej videli v tujini. Jugova pa je še spomnila, da tudi v Sloveniji že slišimo zgodbe, ko otrok staršem pove, da je “binarnega spola” in da si “želi spremeniti spol”, oni pa ne morejo ničesar storiti. “Na žalost se vedno bolj pomikamo v to smer, kjer starši sploh ne bodo več smeli odločati o tem. In če bo kakšen starš morda proti temu, da bi otrok spremenil spol, bo lahko sodno obravnavan, kar se v Kanadi že dogaja, kjer so znani tovrstni primeri. Je pa zelo žalostno to, da se otrokom psihične težave pomaga reševati na takšen način!” In namesto da bi otrokom pomagali prebroditi težko obdobje adolescence, se jim ponuja deformacija spola.\n\nCilj razvrednotenja spola, družine, zgodovine, tradicije in kulture je ustvariti lahko vodljivega potrošnika!\n\nDejstvo je, da če s “spremembo spola” uničiš, denimo žensko telo, boš dobil nefunkcionalno moško telo, poti nazaj pa ni več. Tudi hormonske tablete so še vedno precej neraziskano področje. Še bolj šokantno pa je, da v tujini zdravniki že svetujejo in pred starši celo zagovarjajo zadevo kot edino rešitev za njihovega otroka. Jugova je spomnila, da so največkrat žrtve tovrstnih zlorab prav otroci s problemi, denimo avtisti, številni vzgojitelji v vrtcih in učitelji pa so tej ideologiji že močno naklonjeni. Do Klopčičeve je na paradi na primer pristopil 50-letni učitelj, ki je bil nad transparentom zaprepaden. Klopčičeva: “In takšni učitelji v šolah učijo otroke!” V ozadju celotne zadeve pa je poskus razvrednotenja temeljne celice vsake družbe, to je družine. Klopčičeva: “V SDM menimo, da je v ozadju to, da se razvrednoti osnovna celica vsake družbe, to je družino. Če bodo ljudje ostali brez spola (nisi moški, nisi ženska, nisi mama, nisi oče, ampak starš 1 in starš 2), nimaš svoje kulture, nimaš svoje zgodovine, svoje tradicije, to vodi v razvrednotenje družbe. S tem, da se nimaš za nič več boriti, se ustvarja nek idealen potrošnik, ki bo zelo vodljiv, kar je tudi agenda za tem gibanjem. V SDM se ne borimo proti posameznikom, ampak agendi, ki je za njimi in ki targetira najšibkejše, to je otroke!”\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 32, "end": 62}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 541, "end": 554}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 668, "end": 680}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 726, "end": 807}], "article_id": "4471", "lang": "sl", "text": "Albanija preložila ratifikacijo spornega migracijskega dogovora z Italijo\n\nUstavno sodišče dogovor že podprlo\n\nAlbanski parlament je preložil glasovanje o ratifikaciji spornega dogovora z Italijo, po katerem bi prosilce za azil, rešene na morju, nastanili v dveh migrantskih centrih v Albaniji.\n\nGlasovanje bo preloženo, dokler ne bodo na voljo vsi ustrezni dokumenti z ustavnega sodišča, je pojasnila tiskovna predstavnica albanskega parlamenta, novega datuma glasovanja pa ni podala.\n\nAlbansko ustavno sodišče je že konec januarja podprlo sporni dogovor z Italijo in odločilo, da ta ne krši ozemeljske celovitosti Albanije.

Običajno se namreč prehranjujejo s tjulnji, ki jih ulovijo na plavajočih kosih ledu.\n\nKer pa se led zaradi svetovnega segrevanja taja, številni medvedi preživijo vse več časa na obali, kjer jejo ptičja jajca, gozdne sadeže in travo. Zaradi tega hitro izgubljajo težo, kar povečuje možnost smrti, poroča BBC.\n\nDo osemdesetih let 20. stoletja je število polarnih medvedov padalo, predvsem zaradi netrajnostnega lova. Zaradi večje zakonske zaščite je njihovo število naraslo, svetovno segrevanje pa zdaj zanje predstavlja največjo grožnjo.\n\nMedvedi na ledu lovijo obročkaste tjulnje, ki imajo veliko maščobe, v toplejših mesecih pa so številni dali Arktike brez ledu.\n\nMed letoma 1979 in 2015 se je v Zahodni Manitobi obdobje brez ledu recimo podaljšalo za tri tedne.\n\nTam so opravili raziskavo, da bi ugotovili, kako živali preživijo, ko led izgine.

Večina jih je iskala rastlinje ali gozdne sadeže, ali pa so plavali, da bi našli hrano.\n\nV vseh primerih so bili neuspešni. 19 od 20 medvedov je izgubilo telesno težo, v nekaterih primerih tudi do 11 odstotkov. V povprečju so izgubili kilogram na dan.\n\nSoavtor poročila Charles Robbins z oddelka za medvede na Univerzi Washington State je poudaril, da \"polarni medvedi niso grizliji v belih plaščih\", ampak so \"zelo, zelo drugačni\".\n\nPrejšnje raziskave so poudarile izzive, ki jih bodo prinesle podnebne spremembe, ta raziskava pa odpira pomembno vprašanje o zmožnosti živalskih vrst za prilagajanje

dojenčkom in še ena ženska, morda prijateljica, sorodnica. Na vsa usta smejočemu se dojenčku je navdušeno, ljubeče govorila: \"In da boš zrasla pametna, radovedna, vztrajna, močna ...\" Imamo hčere, sestre, vnukinje, nečakinje, pametne, z doktorati bodo, za Nobelovo bodo, pa še vedno jih bodo moški označevali za punčke v peskovniku, posebej, če bodo res sposobne in odločne. In slej ko prej bodo naletele na stekleni strop, kaj strop, steklene stene.\n\nPomeni, da bodo naletele na še vedno izjemno podcenjujoče dojemanje žensk in njihovih znanj, sposobnosti, položaja v družbi. Stekleni zid moških srednjih let in nekaj čez, pri nas so med najbolj družbeno vokalnimi razni Grimsi, Gorenaki, Ruparji, Janše, Turki, Dežmani, pa še kakšnega slavnega komentatorja sem izpustila, presečno gledano same intelektualne veličine.\n\nNekaj primerov v zadnjem času.\n\nNeža Kogovšek Šalomon, nova ustavna sodnica. Ob njenem imenovanju je Janša tvitnil: Bog pomagaj Sloveniji. Potem so bili še tviti, da je Soroševa plačanka, aktivistka, ki tihotapi ljudi, in tako naprej. Neža Kogovšek Šalomon je seveda izjemna pravna strokovnjakinja, specialistka za področje človekovih pravic. Njeni odzivi na vse napade so bili mirni, dostojanstveni in primerni. Moja ideologija so človekove pravice, je dejala. \n\nAsta Vrečko,  ministrica za kulturo, tarča je vseskozi, posebej v zadnjem času zaradi združevanja muzejev, ki se ukvarjajo z novejšo zgodovino, torej tudi z osamosvojitvijo. Še najlepše, kar je dobila, da je punčka v peskovniku, ki ne ve, kaj dela. Na napade odgovarja podprto z argumenti, umirjeno: \"Našega odnosa do osamosvojitve ne določa število muzejev, temveč kakovost zbirk in njihovega predstavljanja.\"( Dnevnik)\n\nNika Kovač, po fizičnem napadu nanjo se je vsul plaz najbolj neverjetnih tvitov, nekateri so ga primerjali z lažnim napadom na radijsko postajo na poljsko-nemški meji, ki je Nemcem služila kot izgovor za napad na Poljsko in začetek druge svetovne vojne (iz tvita Boštjana M. Turka). Nika Kovač se je, ko so le malo pozneje napadli poslanca Grimsa, odzvala umirjeno in napad obsodila.\n\nSpodoben odziv ni tako lahek, lažje je biti zloben in nesramen. Poskusimo – ko  nek užaljen gospod, ki bo izgubil direktorsko mesto, ki ga je dobil po zaslugi prejšnjega, prav tako izjemno neprijetno nadutega ministra, z nekakšnim zateglim tankim glasom, za katerega verjetno domneva, da izraža \"nadznanje\" in intelektualno premoč, žali ministrico, se mi ves čas pojavlja v mislih v tistem svojem usnjenem plašču, v katerem spominja na herra Flicka iz serije Alo Alo. Ali pa prvak opozicije, ki se zgraža ob imenovanju nove ustavne sodnice, ne pa ob imenovanju svojega kandidata, ki je rabil  17 let, da je diplomiral.\n\nKako pa kaj angleščina, počivaj v miru, v miru? Zvoni kaj zvonec?  Kot tista hrvaška premierka, ki je menda hodila po bruseljskih hodnikih in vsem govorila: \"Yes, yes, I prime minister nine month ...\"\n\nTako lahko je pisati zlobno, cinično in nesramno. Meni osebno znanje tujih jezikov, modne izbire in podobne stvari, ki jih zna vsak smešiti, niso pomembne. S smešenjem sicer samo po sebi ni nič narobe, fino je, če je duhovito. Narobe pa je, ko ljudje to počnejo s pozicije moči in jo izrabljajo na najslabši možen način, ko širijo laži in sovraštvo in nasilje. Ki se vse bolj širi tudi v fizični svet.\n\nObčutek je sicer, naj se še tako napihujejo, da vedo, da so vsaj delu javnosti smešni, pa ne smešni smešni, ampak  bizarni. To pa jih verjetno še dodatno \"razkuri\".\n\nPredvsem pa se spravljajo na ženske.\n\nRaziskovalka Angela Nagle v knjigi Ubijte vse normalneže piše o tem, da se je v zadnjem času na spletu zelo razširila \"antifeministična maskulinistična politika\".\n\nPametne ženske so moške od nekdaj ogrožale. Ker ni šlo drugače, saj je nekako splošno veljalo, da ženske nečesa takega, kot je pamet, ne posedujejo in so jih hitro povezali s satanskimi silami, ker od kod pa naj bi imele znanje, če ne od pajdašenja s temnimi silami.\n\nKnjiga Uničenje modrih žensk, pred leti zelo odmevna, navaja, da so ženske sežigali na grmadah prav zaradi njihovega znanja, največ zaradi znanja o porodničarstvu, ker so opravljale tudi splave, Evropa pa je, prizadeta zaradi epidemij kuge, zelo potrebovala delovno silo.\n\nAli te navedbe povsem držijo ali ne, o tem so debate, del tega pa verjetno drži. Najbrž ni naključje, da v svojem romanu o tem obdobju piše še ena tarča, predsednica državnega zbora Urška Klakočar Zupančič.\n\nPa spomnimo se Kekca, kako se je grdo spravil na Pehto, ker je bila drugačna, ker se je umaknila, ker je imela zdravilsko znanje.\n\nDolg je seznam žensk, ki niso ravno zgorele na grmadi, so pa recimo pristale v norišnici, v najboljšem primeru so bile spregledane.\n\nNekaj, ki jih je spregledal odbor za podelitev Nobelove nagrade.\n\nJocelyn Bell Brunell, odkrila je prvi radijski pulzar, ker je bila študentka, je Nobelovo dobil njen mentor.\n\nLise Meitner,  ena izmed ključnih pri odkritju jedrske cepitve. Za Nobelovo nagrado je bila nominirana kar 46-krat, nikoli je ni dobila.\n\nFizičarka Chien Shiung Wu, sodelovala je pri sestavljanju atomske bombe.

Nobelove seveda ni dobila. (povzeto po: Delo)\n\nVčasih naletiš na dragocene podatke v pop kulturi. Filmi, nadaljevanke so lahko pomemben vir. Film Hidden Figures, Skriti faktorji na primer. \n\nO trojici izjemnih matematičark in inženirk, ki so bile ženske in temnopolte, in to v 50. letih v ZDA, bile pa so ključne osebe, posebej analitična matematičarka Katherine Johnson, pri ameriški poti v vesolje. Morala pa je hoditi skoraj kilometer, da je lahko šla na stranišče, v njeni zgradbi ga za temnopolte ženske ni bilo.\n\nTo ni seznam, ki naj bi dokazoval, da smo tudi ženske pametne, tega nam ni treba dokazovati s seznami, ampak je to seznam krivic, kako so bile spregledane, s kakšnimi težavami so se morale soočati in pokazati dvakrat več kot moški. Ni tako samo v znanosti. Tako je povsod.\n\nZelo povedna anekdota, ki jo pogosto citiram.\n\nNekoč, morda že v 70. ali 80., so v Ameriki ugotovili, da na splošno v orkestrih igra zelo malo žensk.\n\nČeprav so vsi, ki so izbirali nove glasbenike, zatrjevali, da so pač moški toliko boljši, je bilo to vseeno kljub svojemu času nenavadno. Zato so naredili preizkus in avdicije opravljali anonimno, se pravi, komisija je sedela za zaveso, tako da ni videla, ali igra moški ali ženska. In rezultat ni bil za ženske nič kaj boljši. Kaj so potem ugotovili? Da se komisija odloča na podlagi klopotanja petk. Če so zaslišali petke na parketu, so vedeli, da je ženska in so jo črtali. Šele ko so zahtevali, da kandidati in kandidatke pridejo na avdicijo v nogavicah, se je razmerje precej spremenilo in so ženske začele kapljati tudi v filharmonične orkestre. Razen morda na kakšnem Dunaju, kjer so imeli v znamenitem filharmoničnem orkestru prav prepoved zaposlovanja ženskih glasbenic, prvo so uradno sprejeli leta 1997.\n\nTako je, ne gre samo za napade politikov na izpostavljene ženske. Gre za celotno družbo. Zakaj ženske tako težko postanejo kirurginje, zakaj tako težko postanejo direktorice, dekanke, vodilne na katerem koli področju? Spomnimo se efekta klopotanja petk.\n\nDa ne bi govorili samo o dobrih starih časih.\n\nZadnji podatki o enakopravnosti spolov v Evropski uniji kažejo, da je enakost spolov ogrožena, napredka ni, ponekod celo nazaduje. Izrazit je porast hudega nasilja, femicid, leta 2020 je bilo v EU v krogu družine ubitih skoraj 800 žensk, v teh podatkih pa ni 10 držav, ker te statistike niso posredovale.\n\nSeveda pa, čeprav so ženske, kljub naporom in tudi številnim izboljšavam, še vedno v slabšem položaju, to ne pomeni, da je treba nekoga podpirati samo zaradi spola. Ali pa posebej izpostavljati nekoga, ker je ženska, pa naj si bo simpatična, kot je na primer novozelandska premierka. Kot je nekoč zapisala kolumnistka New York Timesa, ne verjamem v dušo, še manj v žensko dušo. Poglejmo na primer italijansko premierko, Giorgio Meloni, do katere imajo tudi naši \"mačoti\" cedeče uslužen odnos. Je pa res, da menda Meloni od vseh zahteva, da jo nagovarjajo v moški obliki, gospod premier torej, morda jo to, poleg dejstva, da delijo odvratno ideologijo, kvalificira.\n\nKljuč je spodobnost. V družbi toksičnih objav, dialogov, so potrpežljivi, umirjeni odzivi, ki jih demonstrirajo naše aktivistke, ministrice, sodnice, pravzaprav najbolj fascinantni. Danes vsak objavi tudi najbolj podle, sprevržene, neumne stvari, ki bi bile pred leti le debata pijanih, \"ta pametnih\" za šankom, zdaj pa se s tem postavljajo in jih del javnosti tudi  nagradi. Nekateri se zato umikajo z družbenih omrežij, s tviterja, kot antropolog Dan Podjed ali pa vse več tujih zvezdnikov, ki zapuščajo, kot je zapisal eden izmed njih, to ... greznico, polno odvratnih internetnih trolov ...\n\nS spodobnostjo proti obscenosti, ki je v zadnjih letih postala gorivo avtoritarnosti, kot pravi filozof Mladen Dolar. \n\nKako vzeti zagon širjenju nestrpnosti, predsodkov in sovraštva, to bo eno ključnih vprašanj.  \n\nDa bodo punce odraščale pametne, vztrajne, radovedne, močne. Pa seveda enako tudi fantje.\n\nAja, pa še to, ali ne kliče zgodba recimo Nike Kovač po kakšnem scenariju, filmu?\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 0, "end": 32}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 465, "end": 469}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 568, "end": 576}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 674, "end": 763}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 677, "end": 690}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 696, "end": 727}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 735, "end": 751}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 766, "end": 824}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 834, "end": 934}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 944, "end": 1048}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 980, "end": 1012}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1015, "end": 1048}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1470, "end": 1592}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 1508, "end": 1538}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1596, "end": 1921}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1598, "end": 1602}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 1700, "end": 1708}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 1728, "end": 1736}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 1889, "end": 1894}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2003, "end": 2097}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2041, "end": 2050}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2129, "end": 2206}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2623, "end": 2817}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2690, "end": 2697}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2820, "end": 2828}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2820, "end": 2903}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3011, "end": 3089}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3063, "end": 3075}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3092, "end": 3247}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3509, "end": 3572}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3509, "end": 3542}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3874, "end": 3986}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4545, "end": 4711}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5143, "end": 5183}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 5203, "end": 5366}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 5953, "end": 6059}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6069, "end": 6108}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 6358, "end": 6486}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 6490, "end": 6701}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6582, "end": 6589}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6874, "end": 6970}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 6973, "end": 7247}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 7015, "end": 7108}], "article_id": "4474", "lang": "sl", "text": "Vojna v Ukrajini se tiče vseh nas\n\nZnanec mi je pred dnevi, ko sva se srečala in začela kramljati, najprej dejal, da ga politika ne zanima, da se v razprave glede dogajanja v Ukrajini ne bo spuščal. Vojna se ga ne tiče. Živi za rekreacijo in obišče kakšno kulturno prireditev.\n\nŠporta in kulture pa ne gre mešati s politiko. V nadaljevanju pa se je vendarle razgovoril. Krivdo za, imenoval ga je prepir, je porazdelil med obe strani, pravzaprav je dodal še tretjo, Zahod. Kritizirali pa naj bi se le Rusi.\n\nStališče, ki me ni pustilo neprizadetega. Vloge v ukrajinski tragediji so jasno opredeljene. V Ukrajini ne gre za nekakšen prepir med dvema sosednjima državama, ampak za rusko invazijo, za neizzvan, nelegalen in nemoralen napad Putinovega režima na Ukrajino. Gre za vojno, nekaj, kar bi moralo skrbeti vsakega med nami.\n\nZakaj je ravnanje ruskega predsednika Putina tako skrb vzbujajoče pravzaprav zavržno in vse obsodbe vredno?\n\nRusija neusmiljeno tepta mednarodno pravo, začenši z Ustanovno listino OZN-a, biblijo današnje svetovne ureditve. Ta v členu 2 (4) prepoveduje uporabo sile ali grožnjo z njo zoper ozemeljsko celovitost in politično neodvisnost druge države. S t. i. memorandumom iz Budimpešte iz leta 1994 se je Rusija še dodatno izrecno zavezala, da bo spoštovala suverenost in ozemeljsko celovitost sosednje Ukrajine v zameno za njeno odpoved nuklearnemu orožju, ki je ostalo na njenem ozemlju po razpadu Sovjetske zveze. Pred dnevi je Rusija tudi ignorirala ukaz Meddržavnega sodišča, najvišjega sodnega organa OZN-a, da nemudoma konča svoje vojaške operacije v Ukrajini.\n\nZ grobo vojaško silo si Rusija skuša podrediti sosednjo državo in jo vključiti v svoje vplivno območje. Odreka ji njeno suverenost, odreka ji pravico, da sama odloča o svoji notranji ureditvi in zunanji politiki, o svoji prihodnosti. Še več, v zadnjih svojih nastopih ji ruski predsednik celo odreka pravico do njenega obstoja. Ob obsodbi tega početja v Generalni skupščini OZN-a na začetku tega meseca, so ruskemu predsedniku stopili v bran le diktatorji Belorusije, Sirije, Severne Koreje in Eritreje. Ob vsem tem pa rusko vodstvo svoji javnosti z raznoraznimi propagandnimi prijemi Rusijo prikazuje kot žrtev. Ukrajina naj bi ogrožala Rusijo (drugo največjo vojaško silo na svetu, oboroženo z nuklearnim in drugim najsodobnejšim orožjem) in to z nacifikacijo svojega vodstva in militarizacijo ukrajinske države ter genocidom, ki naj bi ga ta izvajala nad rusko manjšino na vzhodu države v Donecku in Lugansku. Ogrožala pa jo naj bi tudi širitev Nata proti vzhodu, čeprav naj bi ji bila dana obljuba, da se to ne bo zgodilo. Dokazov za svoje trditve Rusija ne predloži, čeprav je imela glede genocida pred kratkim priložnost v postopku pred Meddržavnim sodiščem, ki pa se ga ni udeležila, ampak spet enostavno ignorirala. Groteskno je primerjati ukrajinskega predsednika Zelenskega, po rodu Juda, z nacisti. Njegova družina in ukrajinski narod sicer sta pod slednjimi v drugi svetovni vojni utrpela veliko gorja, ki ga zdaj, sodeč po žrtvah, beguncih in razdejanju ruski agresor lahko preseže. V vseh teh letih, odkar je prišel na oblast, ruski predsednik tudi ni prišel na dan z dokumentom, ki bi dokazoval zavezo o neširitvi Nata proti ruskim mejam. Ni bil Nato tisti, ki bi se hotel za vsako ceno širiti proti vzhodu celine. Nasprotno, vzhodno- in srednjeevropske države in narodi (vključno z nekaterimi v sami Sovjetski zvezi) so bili tisti, ki so za vsako ceno želeli na Zahod. Ti so se želeli iztrgati iz sovjetskega oziroma ruskega objema ter podrejenosti in zatiranja. Vse do prve ruske agresije na Ukrajino pred osmimi leti na vzhodu celine Natove infrastrukture in dodatnih sil praktično ni bilo. Par tisoč Natovim vojakom, nameščenim v vzhodnih članicah zavezništva po prvem napadu, se je v zadnjih tednih pridružilo še nekaj. Spomnimo, šlo je za čas, ko je Rusija na mejah Ukrajine in v zahodnem delu države brez pojasnila nakopičila 190 tisoč pripadnikov svojih oboroženih sil. Države članice zavezništva Nata so do ruske aneksije Krima leta 2014 krepko zmanjševale obrambne proračune in število ameriških vojakov v Nemčiji oziroma Evropi se je do takrat z nekaj sto tisoč po koncu hladne vojne zmanjšalo na nekaj deset tisoč. Nato ali kakšna njegova članica niso nikoli napadli Sovjetske zveze ali njene naslednice Rusije. Obratno pa je bilo kar nekaj vojaških posredovanj Sovjetske zveze in Rusije v sosednjih državah (Nemška demokratična republika – 1953, Madžarska – 1956, Češkoslovaška – 1968, Gruzija – 2008, Ukrajina – 2014).\n\nInvazija v Ukrajini in njena podreditev predstavljata le del širših prizadevanj ruskega predsednika, da Rusiji povrne veljavo nekdanje Sovjetske zveze in carske Rusije. Prizadevanj, da se kolo zgodovine zavrti nazaj in da se evropski in s tem tudi svetovni politični, varnostni in pravni red postavi na drugačne temelje, kot so bili izgrajevani po drugi svetovni vojni. V njem bi bilo zelo malo prostora za enakopravno sodelovanje med državami, za obstoj mednarodnih organizacij ter mednarodnega prava in veliko za uveljavljanje gole sile in diktata močnejših, ki razpolagajo z nuklearnim orožjem. Tudi z njim je na začetku invazije grozil ruski predsednik. Pred našimi očmi se v teh dneh podira evropska ureditev, zajeta v helsinškem sklepnem dokumentu iz leta 1975, ki ga je podpisala Sovjetska zveza in nasledila Rusija. Ta je nastal v krogu prizadevanja Konference oziroma Organizacije za varnost in sodelovanje v Evropi. Spomnimo na njegova načela: 1) suverena enakost držav, 2) vzdrževanje od uporabe in grožnje z uporabo sile, 3) nedotakljivost meja, 4) teritorialna celovitost držav, 5) miroljubno reševanje sporov, 6) nevmešavanje v notranje zadeve, 7) spoštovanje človekovih pravic in temeljnih svoboščin, vključno s svobodo mišljenja, vesti, vere in prepričanja, 8) enakost pravic in samoodločbe narodov, 9) sodelovanje med državami, 10) izpostavljanje obveznosti mednarodnega prava v dobri veri. Gre za načela, za katera verjamem, da so oziroma bi morala biti pri srcu tudi ljubiteljem kulture in športa. Rusija je v preteklih tednih prekršila prav vse.\n\nNe gre za nekakšno filozofsko, teoretično razmišljanje, ampak za nekaj zelo konkretnega, kar občutimo, vidimo, če nismo ravno slepi, že tudi zunaj ukrajinskih meja. Ne gre le za begunce, ki so preplavili Evropo in ki smo jih tako toplo sprejeli. Vojna se odraža na pretrganih gospodarskih, trgovinskih povezavah, na višjih cenah energentov in blaga ter na višji inflaciji itd.\n\nUpam, če ne že omenjeno, da bodo mojega apolitičnega znanca o potrebi ne samo obsodbe ruske agresije, ampak tudi njene takojšnje zaustavitve prepričale grozljive podobe, ki prihajajo z dežele ob Dnepru v teh dneh. Mislim na namerna vsakodnevna bombardiranja bolnišnic, šol, vrtcev, stanovanjskih poslopij, gledališč in trgovskih centrov. Mislim na uporabo prepovedanih kasetnih bomb. Gre za vojna hudodelstva. Z njimi skuša ruska vojska ubiti voljo Ukrajincev do odpora, do obrambe. Do nje, tako individualne kot kolektivne, imajo Ukrajinci po Ustanovni listini OZN-a (čl. 51) in običajnem mednarodnem pravu vso pravico. Pri obrambi svoje demokratične ureditve in svobode upravičeno pričakujejo našo solidarnost in pomoč. Njihovo preživetje je stvar vseh nas.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 56, "end": 79}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1728, "end": 1797}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2129, "end": 2141}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 2147, "end": 2275}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2147, "end": 2275}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2680, "end": 2761}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2806, "end": 2818}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2836, "end": 2970}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2932, "end": 2970}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3105, "end": 3114}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3119, "end": 3124}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 3227, "end": 3359}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 3434, "end": 3574}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3510, "end": 3531}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3766, "end": 3856}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3778, "end": 3799}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 3874, "end": 4007}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 4049, "end": 4111}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 4222, "end": 4285}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4249, "end": 4270}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4342, "end": 4443}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 4364, "end": 4443}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 4544, "end": 4580}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4568, "end": 4580}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4845, "end": 4944}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5220, "end": 5336}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5282, "end": 5314}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5415, "end": 5457}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 5475, "end": 5536}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 5561, "end": 5697}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5585, "end": 5597}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5660, "end": 5670}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5741, "end": 5785}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 5790, "end": 5955}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5810, "end": 5830}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 5997, "end": 6029}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 6033, "end": 6148}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 6211, "end": 6327}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6211, "end": 6327}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6304, "end": 6327}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 6485, "end": 6618}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6827, "end": 6929}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6979, "end": 7039}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 7091, "end": 7099}], "article_id": "4475", "lang": "sl", "text": "﻿Poslanci potrdili deklaracijo o Palestini in Izraelu: “Tudi vojne imajo pravila”\n\nDržavni zbor je danes z 49 glasovi za in brez glasov proti podprl deklaracijo o razmerah v Palestini in Izraelu, ki so jo predlagali koalicijski poslanci.

Deklaracija poziva k takojšnji prekinitvi sovražnosti in spopadov v regiji ter izraža neomajno podporo rešitvi dveh držav, ki bi jo dosegli s pogajanji na podlagi meja iz leta 1967 in bi vključevala dve suvereni, demokratični državi.\n\nPoslanci so z 49 glasovi za in brez glasov proti podprli deklaracijo.

Do hujše zaostritve je prišlo 7. oktobra ob raketnih napadih in vdoru pripadnikov palestinskega oboroženega gibanja Hamas iz Gaze na ozemlje Izraela, ko je bilo ubitih 1.200 ljudi, večinoma civilistov. Izrael je še isti dan odgovoril s silovitimi povračilnimi napadi na palestinsko enklavo. Slednje je nato začasno ustavil minuli teden ob sprejetju dogovora o prekinitvi ognja, ki je trenutno še v veljavi.\n\n“Deklaraciji ne sme ali ne more nasprotovati nihče v tem državnem zboru”\n\n“Trenutno humanitarno premirje, kolikor je sicer samo po sebi spodbudno, žal še ne zagotavlja, da se bodo razmere kmalu umirile,” je prepričan Stojanovič.\n\nIzraelske sile so v napadih iz zraka in po kopnem v manj kot enem mesecu ubile skoraj 15.000 ljudi, med njimi preko 6.000 otrok, zaradi česar je Stojanovič Gazo označil za grobišče otrok.\n\n“Deklaracija je predvsem humanitarne narave, zaradi česar ji v resnici ne sme ali ne more nasprotovati nihče v tem državnem zboru,” je prepričan Stojanovič. Ob tem je pozval k razmisleku o naslednjem koraku, ki naj bi bil priznanje neodvisne Palestine.\n\nDržavni sekretar na zunanjem ministrstvu Marko Štucin je ob tej priložnosti pojasnil stališče MZEZ, ki da podpira priznanje Palestine šele po tem, ko pride do prekinitve spopadov in se sprte strani sporazumejo o rešitvi dveh držav.\n\nMatej T. Vatovec je v imenu Levice povedal, da so podobe iz Gaze nekaj, česar človeštvo v 21. stoletju ne bi smelo več dovoljevati. Pri tem je za krivca označil Izrael oz. “skrajen režim”, ki mu vlada. “Kar se dogaja na okupiranih območjih, kar se dogaja v Gazi, kar se dogaja na Zahodnem bregu, ni nič drugega kot zločin proti človeštvu,” je povedal in dodal, da bi tudi sicer morali v razpravah o izraelskih politikah uporabljati ustrezne označevalce, kot so med drugim apartheid ali genocid.\n\nPozdravil je dejstvo, da slovenska vlada razmišlja o priznanju Palestine, pri čemer pa je izrazil upanje, da postopek ne bo trajal predolgo, saj da se palestinska ozemlja pod pritiskom nezakonitih izraelskih naselbin vztrajno krčijo.\nStališča SD je predstavil Predrag Baković, ki je odgovor na vprašanje, ali gre pri uničevanju bolnišnic, šol in uradov Združenih narodov v Gazi za zločine proti človeštvu, prepustil mednarodnemu kazenskemu sodišču. V SD sicer obsojajo napade na civilno infrastrukturo. “Ukazi k evakuaciji severnega dela Gaze, blokada humanitarne pomoči in neselektivni napadi na bolnišnice ter šole predstavljajo ravno tiste vrste kolektivnega kaznovanja, ki ni dovoljeno niti opravičljivo pod nobenim pogojem,” je prepričan.\n\nMednarodna skupnost mora storiti vse, kar je v njeni moči, da se prepreči širjenje konflikta, ki bi lahko destabiliziral celotno regijo, je dejal Baković. Kot je še poudaril, vojaška sila nikoli ne bo prinesla trajne rešitve tega konflikta.\n\nLenart Žavbi je v imenu Gibanja Svoboda povedal, da obsojajo teroristične dejavnosti Hamasa, a da njihovo nasilje ne daje pravice za kolektivno kaznovanje vseh Palestincev. “V tem konkretnem konfliktu je jasno razvidno, da so nekateri pozabili, da imajo tudi vojne svoja pravila in da ima tudi pravica do samoobrambe svoje meje,” je izpostavil Žavbi. Poslance desnice je pozval, naj vendarle podprejo deklaracijo.\n\nV SDS skrbi, da bi Slovenija postala migrantski žep\n\nBranko Grims je v predstavitvi stališč glavne opozicijske stranke SDS predstavil amandma, s katerim bi DZ vlado pozval, naj ustavi vsa plačila palestinskim oblastem v okviru razvojnega sodelovanja, opravi pregled mednarodnega razvojnega financiranja države ter zagotovi, da slovensko financiranje ne bo zlorabljeno za posredno podporo terorističnim organizacijam. SDS predlaga tudi sprejetje ukrepov za prepoved širjenja antisemitizma, nošenja transparentov ter protestov v podporo Hamasu, prepoved javnega poveličevanje simbolov Hamasa in libanonskega gibanja Hezbolah ter določitev kazni za te kršitve.\n\nGrims je namreč prepričan, da se voditelji Hamasa bogatijo na račun finančne pomoči, ki jo “naivna Evropa in naivna Slovenija” pošiljata Palestincem. Krivdo za humanitarno krizo v oblegani palestinski enklavi Grims pripisuje Hamasu, ki da koristi civiliste za živi ščit. Izpostavil je skrb, da bi se vojna z Bližnjega vzhoda prelila na evropska tla. Še posebej ga skrbi, da bi Slovenija postala migrantski žep, med prišleki pa bi po njegovem prepričanju lahko bili tudi pripadniki Hamasa, v kolikor niso že tu.\n\nMatej Tonin je v imenu NSi povedal, da je potrebno k tej tematiki pristopiti razumsko. “Če bomo še naprej z navijaškim pristopom podpirali eno ali drugo stran, potem se bodo seveda politične sile in konflikti množili naprej in konflikt se bo podaljševal,” verjame Tonin. Po njegovem mnenju zato zdaj ni čas za priznanje Palestine, edina stvar, ki jo Slovenija lahko naredi, pa je, da podpre organizacije, ljudi in projekte, ki si prizadevajo za mir.\n\nBaković je v odgovor predlagateljem amandmaja povedal, da kazenski zakonik že ureja področje izražanja antisemitizma, Hamas pa da EU že opredeljuje za teroristično organizacijo. Spomnil je tudi, da Slovenija trenutno ne podpira projektov v Gazi, pač pa Palestincem pomaga samo s humanitarnimi sredstvi. Prav tako je poudaril, da so v Bruslju nedavno ugotovili, da dosedanja evropska sredstva niso šla v roke Hamasu, obenem pa so napovedali strožji nadzor nad sredstvi.\n\nStojanovič je povedal, da so shodi legitimen izraz stališč, Nataša Sukič (Levica) pa, da na shodih ni videla izrazov podpore Hamasu, zgolj Palestini.\n\nIz vrst opozicije je bilo sicer v parlamentu slišati več očitkov na račun predlagateljev, češ da v razpravo med pripravo predloga niso vključili druge strani. V imenu predlagateljev je Stojanovič navedbe, da se o deklaraciji niso posvetovali s pristojnim ministrstvom, označil za napačne, zavrnil pa je tudi očitke o navijaštvu, ki da se lahko razbere iz deklaracije.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 329, "end": 430}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 364, "end": 372}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 652, "end": 663}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 1305, "end": 1373}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 2049, "end": 2060}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 2427, "end": 2487}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3383, "end": 3468}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3813, "end": 3828}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3831, "end": 3912}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 3846, "end": 3854}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 3916, "end": 4105}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 4109, "end": 4135}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4158, "end": 4213}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 4257, "end": 4363}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 4570, "end": 4661}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4667, "end": 4706}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 4872, "end": 4979}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6798, "end": 6816}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6827, "end": 6844}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 6949, "end": 6990}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 7919, "end": 8033}], "article_id": "4476", "lang": "sl", "text": "Zakaj praznujemo dan žena? Je boj za enakost še potreben?\n\nLjudje 8. marec kot poseben dan za ženske praznujemo že več kot stoletje, kot opozorilo na neenakosti med spoloma pa služi še danes. Ženskam v Afganistanu so talibani lani med drugim prepovedali visokošolsko izobraževanje, v Iranu so izbruhnili množični protesti, potem ko je moralna policija 22-letnico \"podučila\" o nošenju hidžaba, čez nekaj dni pa je v bolnišnici umrla. Razlike med spoloma je poudarila tudi ruska invazija na Ukrajino, ženske so bolj ranljive, kar se tiče dostopa do hrane, bolj so podvržene revščini, poroča pa se tudi o vse več nasilju nad ženskami. V ZDA medtem denimo bijejo bitko proti prepovedi splava. A vendar smo ljudje v zadnjih letih dosegli tudi nemalo sprememb na bolje.\n\nMednarodni dan žena je zrasel iz delavskega gibanja in postal priznan letni dogodek Združenih narodov (ZN). Začetki segajo v leto 1908, ko je 20.000 žensk na pohodu skozi New York zahtevalo krajši delovni čas, boljše plačilo in volilno pravico. Leto pozneje je Socialistična stranka Amerike razglasila prvi nacionalni dan žena.\n\nIdejo, da bi ta dan postal mednaroden, je predstavila Clara Zetkin, komunistična aktivistka in zagovornica pravic žensk. Zamisel je predlagala leta 1910 na mednarodni konferenci delavk v Københavnu. Tam je bilo 100 žensk iz 17 držav, ki so se soglasno strinjale z njenim predlogom.\n\nPrvič so ga nato v Avstriji, na Danskem, v Nemčiji, Švici, pa tudi v Trbovljah praznovali leto kasneje. Stoletnico smo praznovali leta 1911, letos tako praznujemo že 112. mednarodni dan žena. Zadeva je sicer uradna postala leta 1975, ko so ta dan začeli praznovati Združeni narodi.  \n\nMednarodni dan žena je postal datum za praznovanje napredka žensk v družbi, politiki in gospodarstvu, medtem ko politične korenine dneva pomenijo organiziranje stavk in protestov za ozaveščanje o stalni neenakosti.\n\nZakaj prav 8. marec?\n\nClara sicer za mednarodni dan žena ni predlagala točnega datuma. Datum je bil formaliziran med vojno stavko leta 1917, ko so ruske ženske zahtevale \"kruh in mir\", štiri dni po stavki pa je bil car prisiljen pristati na njihove zahteve, začasna vlada pa je ženskam podelila volilno pravico.\n\nZačetek stavke je po julijanskem koledarju, ki so ga takrat uporabljali v Rusiji, padel na nedeljo, 23. februarja. Po gregorijanskem koledarju je bil to 8. marec, ki je tako postal uraden datum dneva žena. \n\nKako se praznuje dan žena?\n\nVečini je znana ideja, da se na ta dan ženskam podarja cvetje. O tem priča tudi promet v cvetličarnah, ki se v treh ali štirih dneh okoli 8. marca podvoji, če ne celo potroji.  \n\nDan praznujejo tudi v Rusiji, na Kitajskem pa imajo številne ženske 8. marca po priporočilu državnega sveta celo pol prostega dneva. V Italiji mednarodni dan žena ali la Festa della Donna praznujejo s podarjanjem cvetov mimoze. Izvor te tradicije ni jasen, vendar se domneva, da se je začela v Rimu po drugi svetovni vojni.\n\nV ZDA so ženskam posvetili kar cel mesec, mesec marec je namreč mesec ženske zgodovine. Predsedniška poslanica, izdana vsako leto, tako počasti dosežke ameriških žensk.\n\nZakaj potrebujemo dan žena?\n\nŠtevilne ženske po svetu se morajo danes še vedno boriti za svoje pravice in to ne le v manj razvitih državah. Zaradi vojne, nasilja in političnih sprememb so bile v zadnjem letu posebej ranljive ženske v Afganistanu, Iranu, Ukrajini, pa tudi v ZDA.  \n\nV Afganistanu je ponoven vzpon talibanov oviral napredek na področju človekovih pravic, saj so ženskam in dekletom prepovedali visokošolsko izobraževanje, prav tako ne smejo opravljati večino del zunaj doma, brez moškega spremljevalca ne smejo oditi predaleč od doma, v javnosti pa si morajo zakrivati obraz. \n\nV Iranu je proteste sprožila smrt Mahse Amini, 22-letne ženske, ki jo je 13. septembra lani v Teheranu aretirala t. i. moralna policija. Žensko naj bi \"podučila\" o nošenju hidžaba, čez nekaj dni pa je v bolnišnici umrla.\n\nOd takrat so se demonstracije nadaljevale po vsej državi, pri čemer so številni Iranci – tako ženske kot moški – pozivali k boljšim pravicam žensk in spremembi trenutnega političnega vodstva. \"Ženska, življenje, svoboda\" je slogan protestov. Oblasti so jih prikazale kot nemire in se odzvale s silo. V protestih je umrlo več kot 500 ljudi.\n\nPo poročanju Združenih narodov so razlike med spoloma še bolj opazne tudi zaradi ruske invazije na Ukrajino. Poročajo namreč o velikih razlikah med spoloma, kar se tiče dostopa do hrane in posledično podhranjenosti. Izpostavili so razlike v podvrženosti revščini, poročajo pa tudi o vse več nasilju nad ženskami. Zaradi zvišanja cen in pomanjkanja je ta trend opazen tudi drugod po svetu, ne le v Ukrajini.  \n\nBitko v nekaterih zveznih državah bijejo tudi Američanke. Naj spomnimo, da je 24. junija lani vrhovno sodišče ZDA razveljavilo \"Roe proti Wadu\", zgodovinski del zakonodaje, ki je ščitil pravico do splava. Na milijone ljudi je tako napolnilo ulice v več zveznih državah, kjer so protestirali proti prepovedi splava. Tamkajšnje ženske zdaj pomoč iščejo tudi na primer v Mehiki, kjer je splav od leta 2021 dekriminaliziran. \n\nV zadnjih letih beležimo tudi spremembe na bolje\n\nKljub naštetemu je v zadnjih nekaj letih prišlo tudi do pozitivnih sprememb.  \n\nNovembra lani je Evropski parlament po 10-letnem boju sprejel zakon za zagotovitev, da bo v upravnih odborih javnih družb do julija 2026 zastopanih več žensk. \"Veliko žensk je usposobljenih za najvišje položaje in z našo novo evropsko zakonodajo bomo poskrbeli, da bodo resnično imele možnost, da te položaje tudi zasedejo,\" so sporočili iz EU.\n\nMedtem so bili v Armeniji in Kolumbiji posodobljeni zakoni o starševskem dopustu, Španija pa je sprejela zakone, ki podpirajo menstrualni dopust in širijo dostop do splava.\n\nMednarodni olimpijski komite je poročal o spolno najbolj uravnoteženih zimskih igrah, pri čemer so ženske predstavljale 45 odstotkov športnikov v Pekingu 2022. Čeprav enakost spolov ni bila dosežena, so nove smernice spodbujale bolj uravnoteženo pokritost ženskega športa.\n\nTudi Svetovno prvenstvo Fifa za ženske leta 2023 se je razširilo, saj v njem sodeluje 36 ekip. Ameriška nogometna zveza je pred tekmovanjem dosegla zgodovinski dogovor o enakovrednem plačilu svojih moških in ženskih ekip, s čimer je postala prva v tem športu, ki je obema spoloma obljubila enako plačilo. Igralke so si morale to sicer izboriti s številnimi zahtevki in tožbami, svoj prav pa so zagovarjale več kot pet let. \n\nKaj pa mednarodni dan moških?\n\nDan žena prazujejo tako ženske kot tudi moški, ki podpirajo enakopravnost spolov. Poznamo pa tudi dan, namenjen moškim – 10. marec je namreč dan mučenikov. Praznik ima sicer svoje korenine v krščanskem izročilu. Po legendi se je v četrtem stoletju 40 vojakov elitne legije uprlo ukazu, da se odpovejo krščanstvu. Vrgli so jih v ledeno mrzel ribnik, kjer so tragično preminuli. \n\nPraznik so si ljudje izmislili nekje po drugi svetovni vojni kot protipol prazniku žena. Rekli so: \"Če ženske praznujejo, morajo pa tudi moški,\" je pred leti za naš portal pojasnil etnolog Janez Bogataj. Bogataj meni, da ta praznik danes nima kakšnega pretiranega pomena. Prepričan je, da moški ne potrebujejo praznika, ki bi bil protiutež dnevu žena. \"Če bi bili res enakopravni, potem bi vsi praznovali celo leto,\" je prepričan. \"Ta praznik kaže na neko krizo v sodobni družbi,\" zaključuje Bogataj. Po tradiciji se sicer moškim na ta dan kot simboličen opomin, da se mučeništvo v njihovem življenju še vedno dogaja, pa tudi kot znak partneričine pozornosti, podarjajo suhe slive, trnje in klobasa. \n\nPo poročanju BBC-ja pa je moškim po svetu namenjen še en dan, in sicer 19. november. Ta datum kot dan moških poznamo šele od 90. let, a ga ZN ne priznavajo. Kljub temu ga ljudje praznujejo v več kot 80 državah po vsem svetu. Dan naj bi slavil vse pozitivne stvari, ki jih moški prinašajo svetu, svojim družinam in skupnostim, pravijo organizatorji, ki dodajajo, da je namen praznika izpostaviti pozitivne vzornike, ozaveščanje o dobrem počutju moških in izboljšati odnose med spoloma. \n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 33, "end": 97}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 62, "end": 67}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 334, "end": 342}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 345, "end": 389}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 629, "end": 691}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 650, "end": 665}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 679, "end": 691}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 740, "end": 917}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 920, "end": 1156}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1209, "end": 1232}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 1339, "end": 1356}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1359, "end": 1639}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 1695, "end": 1766}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 1770, "end": 1783}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1859, "end": 2199}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1862, "end": 1871}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1862, "end": 1977}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1920, "end": 1931}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1984, "end": 2031}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2016, "end": 2021}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2037, "end": 2143}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2086, "end": 2093}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2203, "end": 2407}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2220, "end": 2240}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 2249, "end": 2407}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2526, "end": 2545}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2625, "end": 2786}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2790, "end": 2797}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2809, "end": 3098}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2903, "end": 2910}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 3101, "end": 3256}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3149, "end": 3256}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 3260, "end": 3348}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3287, "end": 3293}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3416, "end": 3566}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3418, "end": 3422}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3663, "end": 3671}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3694, "end": 3793}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3770, "end": 3777}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3904, "end": 3910}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3960, "end": 3965}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3967, "end": 4077}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4080, "end": 4206}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4184, "end": 4206}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4220, "end": 4232}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4354, "end": 4360}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4703, "end": 4711}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4766, "end": 4784}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 4792, "end": 5048}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4837, "end": 4845}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 5075, "end": 5089}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 5075, "end": 5089}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5083, "end": 5089}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 5092, "end": 5166}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5169, "end": 5199}], "article_id": "4477", "lang": "sl", "text": "Ob takšni miselnosti oblastnikov je edina rešitev za prometni kolaps vrnitev na sistem »par/nepar«\n\nZadnja nesreča na ljubljanski obvoznici, kjer se je tovornjak, skoraj brez zaviranja, zaletel v avtomobila pred seboj, sila trka pa jih je porinila v drugo tovorno vozilo, kar je povzročilo požar in posledično smrt treh ljudi, je res grozljiva. A nič novega in prav tako nič nepričakovanega. Promet na slovenskih cestah (še posebej avtocestah) eksponentno raste in se je v zadnjih desetih letih povečal za približno 30 %. Samo trenutna medletna rast je okoli 6 %. Na določenih odsekih ljubljanske obvoznice so številke še večje. V času dopustniških »selitev narodov« pa sploh že neobvladljive. Zamaški, nesreče, upočasnjen prometni tok.  \n\nStrokovna javnost na problem omejitev obstoječe cestne infrastrukture, še posebej avtocestne mreže, v taki obliki kot je danes, opozarja že petnajst, intenzivno pa vsaj deset let. A kot na drugih področjih tudi o prepotrebnih prometnih rešitvah država predvsem govori in planira, naroča študije, plačuje elaborate, vmes pa si, prav po birokratsko, kakršnekoli rešitve oteži z dodatnimi omejitvami obstoječe zakonodaje – recimo obveznimi poročili o vplivih na okolje –, kar lahko traja in traja, saj mora biti t. i. »javnosti« zagotovljen vpogled v dokumentacijo, izražanje mnenj, dajanje pripomb …\n\nKam to pelje, vemo. In namesto da bi država pospešeno reševala problematiko zagotavljanja pretočnosti s širitvijo na tretji pas, sprejme uredbo, ki otežuje pridobitev gradbenega dovoljenja zanj na že obstoječi avtocesti. Namesto poostritve nadzora in urejanja prometa v toku, ukine avtocestno policijo. Namesto pospešene posodobitve mreže javnega prevoza, se iz Maribora v Ljubljano z vlakom vozimo dlje kot v času Avstro-Ogrske.\n\nKako dolgo še? To retorično vprašanje si zadnje čase lahko zastavljamo na več področjih. Od zavoženega zdravstva, kjer namesto dejanskih rešitev raje demonizirajo posamezne skupine in izumljajo nove prispevke, ter šolstva, ki je uspelo kadrovsko sesuti samo sebe, do gospodarstva, kjer poleg tega, da bi podjetnike »sterali« v morje, ne znamo več meriti niti letne rasti BDP, na oceni katere temelji državna poraba in zadolževanje.\n\nMedtem poslušamo populistične floskule o tem, da bo zdravstvo rešeno z ukinitvijo dopolnilnega zavarovanja, da bo šolstvo boljše, ko bomo učiteljem (spet) zvišali plače, da bo proračun rešen z novimi davki. A dejstvo je, da sama kvantiteta ne določa kvalitete. Kot tudi varnosti in pretočnosti v prometu ne moremo rešiti z demagoškimi izjavami o nepotrebnosti tretjega pasu, ker s tem samo vzpodbujamo še več prometa, ali nerealistično idejo o vsesplošni selitvi cestnega prometa na železnice, ki enostavno ne zdrži strokovne presoje, na kar opozarja prometni strokovnjak Gregor Ficko.\n\nLunapark\n\nSkratka. Kot marsikje sta tudi promet in predvsem politika reševanja njegove eksponentne rasti ujeta v labirint populističnih in nedomišljenih rešitev, sprejemanja dodatnih vprašljivih zakonodajnih omejitev ter drobljenja strokovne vsebine med ministrstva, agencije, direkcije in logistične sektorje. In nihče v tej državi (podobno kot v zdravstvu) pravzaprav nima niti približno ideje, kaj bomo, recimo čez približno 4 leta, ko tretjega pasu še vedno ne bo.\n\nNajvečja ironija je, da bi famozni »tretji pas« pravzaprav ponekod že zdavnaj lahko imeli. Narejene so bile študije, pripravljeni načrti, vloženi zahtevki. A hudič je v podrobnostih in teh nikakor ni mogoče domisliti na ministrstvih, za katere sploh ne vemo, kako se po zadnji reorganizaciji vlade imenujejo. Kaj šele katero ministrstvo in kdo na njih je za določeno vsebino pristojen. Je pa to krasni »lunapark« za že omenjeno t. i. »javnost«, ki lahko sodeluje, predlaga, pregleduje, pripominja … se skratka izživlja in zraven služi s popolnoma dezorientiranim sistemom, kjer glasna manjšina vodi indoktrinirano večino v prihodnost popolnega kolapsa.\n\nS cest med žabe in metulje\n\nA kdo sploh lahko jamra? Veliko jih je dobilo to, kar so volili, na referendumih izglasovali, v anketah pa še vedno zadovoljno podpirajo. Od »učinkovitih« in »pravočasnih« ukrepov vlade ob poplavah do pravičnih in edino pravilnih obdavčitev »kapitalističnih pujsov«. Vmes pa še glorifikacija solidarnostnih sobot in ukinjanje koncesionarjev oz. privatnega zdravstva kar v celoti. V tem smislu rešitev prometnega kolapsa ob odsotnosti kakršnihkoli dolgoročnejših rešitev ni daleč od preproste vrnitve k sistemu »par/nepar«. Na ta način lahko v enem zamahu skoraj prepolovimo udeležence v cestnem prometu, z dragimi energenti, prisilnim zelenim prehodom in potovalnim časom, ki je za relacijo Primorska–Ljubljana daljši, kot je bil v 70. letih, pa sploh dokončno prepodimo večino iz cest nazaj na nedotaknjene zelene travnike med žabe in metulje.\n\nKer dokler v tej državi njeni državljani ne bomo ZAHTEVALI (ter se v skladu s tem tudi odločali ob volilnih skrinjicah) dostojnega javnega zdravstva, neideološkega šolskega sistema, depolitiziranih javnih servisov in tudi pretočnih in varnih cest, preboja ne bo. Kaj šele tretjega pasu. Bomo pa umirali. Zaradi čakalnih vrst ali pa preobremenjene in nevarne cestne infrastrukture. Je v tej državi komu mar za to?\n\nVprašanje je, ponovno, zgolj retorično.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Slogans", "start": 0, "end": 71}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 30, "end": 56}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 74, "end": 137}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 197, "end": 336}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 260, "end": 336}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 263, "end": 279}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 393, "end": 413}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 393, "end": 535}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 962, "end": 977}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1015, "end": 1028}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 1246, "end": 1539}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1624, "end": 1647}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 1908, "end": 2187}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1908, "end": 2187}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1953, "end": 2007}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2091, "end": 2101}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2466, "end": 2476}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 2640, "end": 2782}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2785, "end": 2817}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2897, "end": 2919}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2996, "end": 3005}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3017, "end": 3058}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 3061, "end": 3288}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 3061, "end": 3121}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 3124, "end": 3182}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 3291, "end": 3344}], "article_id": "4478", "lang": "sl", "text": "Protestiramo, ker naše delo v kapitalističnem patriarhatu ni nič vredno!\n\nZa kapital je jedrna družina s hraniteljskim modelom nujna enota, saj vzdržuje obstoječo delovno silo ter oblikuje bodočo.

Za mlajše ženske se pričakuje, da bomo kmalu noseče, šle na porodniško ter kasneje koristile bolniško in dopuste za naše otroke. Ker so bolniška nadomestila izplačana zgolj v 80 % višini plače, nas močno prizadene visoka stopnja revščina. Zaradi ekonomske odvisnosti od družinskih članov težje zapustimo nasilne intimnopartnerske odnose. Zaradi zaprtosti v zasebnost doma pa imamo omejen dostop do javnih dobrin in storitev.\n\nHraniteljski model omogoča, da se zaposlitev in dohodek ženske tudi v novodobnih kapitalističnih sistemih obravnava kot dodaten prispevek oz. dopolnilo k domnevno že obstoječemu družinskemu dohodku. Slednji naj bi bil še vedno v domeni moških hraniteljev, ne glede na naš dejanski partnerski ali zakonski stan ali pa dejanski zaposlitveni status našega partnerja.\n\nTa politika nas strukturno odriva na rob kot pomožno, podcenjeno in še bolj izkoriščano delovno silo. Potiska nas v podrejeni položaj v družini in deluje kot eden osnovnih mehanizmov kapitalizma, ki omogoča, da je polovica človeškega dela prosto dostopen in vedno razpoložljiv vir. To se na institucionalni ravni utrjuje s subvencijami za zaposlovanje za polovičen delovni čas, dodatkom za vzdrževane družinske člane, pokojninskimi reformami in drugimi ukrepi na zdravstvenih, delovnopravnih, stanovanjskih in izobraževalnih področjih.\n\nReproduktivno delo v kapitalizmu za plačilo največkrat spada med podplačane in pogosto prekarne oblike dela na trgu, hkrati pa predstavlja le minimalen odziv na najbolj pereče družbene probleme. Kolektivno podružbljanje gospodinjskih in varstvenih opravil bi namreč zahtevalo množično prerazdelitev dohodka v prid tistim, ki ga ustvarjamo, ne pa tistih, ki si ga prilaščajo. Dokler do tega ne pride, bo plačano reproduktivno delo v zasebni sferi zgolj obliž na globinsko rano, saj se kapitalistični produkcijski odnosi ne bodo odpravili.\n\nNe bomo več životarile za mezdo, medtem ko se iz našega dela drugi bogatijo. Zahtevamo, da se reproduktivno delo v čim večji meri podružbi. Zahtevamo javne domove za ostarele, vrtce, menze, pralnice! Ustvariti moramo takšno družbo, ki bo prepoznala vrednost reproduktivnega dela in ga prenesla na skupnost. Ker pa naše delo trenutno ni nič vredno, protestiramo!\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 70, "end": 113}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 318, "end": 519}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 393, "end": 519}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 629, "end": 706}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 651, "end": 706}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 758, "end": 873}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 876, "end": 969}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1000, "end": 1067}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1070, "end": 1193}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1206, "end": 1380}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1715, "end": 1842}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1715, "end": 1749}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1860, "end": 1872}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1977, "end": 2090}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2078, "end": 2090}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2093, "end": 2097}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2093, "end": 2199}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2202, "end": 2328}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2449, "end": 2457}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2466, "end": 2668}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2540, "end": 2549}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2855, "end": 2869}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 2906, "end": 3001}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 3005, "end": 3024}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 3005, "end": 3178}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3336, "end": 3345}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3412, "end": 3439}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3735, "end": 3762}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3830, "end": 3842}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3864, "end": 3886}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3877, "end": 3886}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3889, "end": 3990}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3920, "end": 3926}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 4109, "end": 4148}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4207, "end": 4362}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4364, "end": 4379}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4381, "end": 4391}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4395, "end": 4697}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4573, "end": 4586}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4829, "end": 4837}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 5186, "end": 5415}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5271, "end": 5280}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5373, "end": 5391}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5568, "end": 5576}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6050, "end": 6056}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6079, "end": 6154}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6584, "end": 6601}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 6810, "end": 7007}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6905, "end": 7257}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 7260, "end": 7417}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 7509, "end": 7533}], "article_id": "4479", "lang": "sl", "text": "Opomnik, da NATO trenutno ne meče bomb na evropske civiliste\n\nK sreči večina Evropejcev tega opomnika ne potrebuje. Niti ga ne potrebujejo voditelji zahodnih držav, ki so ob Putinovi invaziji na Ukrajino presenetljivo enotni, kljub dolgoletnim naporom ruskega predsednika, da s kibernetsko vojno to enotnost razgradi. Vseeno pa je moč v zahodnih evropskih državah zaznati manjšinski argument, da je za Putinovo invazijo na Ukrajino v resnici kriv NATO oziroma Američani, ker da s svojo širitvijo na vzhod ogrožajo Rusijo. Kljub temu, da gre za manjšinsko mnenje, se manifestira v različnih pojavnih oblikah in ideoloških barvah, vsem pa je skupno, da noben od teh argumentov v dani situaciji pač ni na mestu.\n\nŠiritev NATO zavezništva na Vzhod se ne dogaja, ker želijo Američani okupirati največjo jedrsko silo na svetu, v kar je Putin menda prepričal dobršen del populacije, drži pa, da želijo preventivno zamejiti potencialno grožnjo, ki jo predstavlja Putinova vojska. Kot kaže z dobrim razlogom; tudi jaz sem bil presenečen, da so imeli Američani glede nečesa prav. Drži tudi, da Američani zasledujejo interese v regiji, predvsem ekonomske, šele potem obrambo demokratičnih vrednot, ali kaj. A vendar, širitev se dogaja predvsem zato, ker vzhodnoevropski narodi Rusijo – sploh pa Rusijo pod vodstvom Putina – zaradi zgodovinskih razlogov dojemajo kot primarno varnostno grožnjo in ker jim je jasno, da jim sprejetje (ne nasilna aneksija) v zahodno sfero vpliva omogoča neprimerno boljši način življenja in višji življenjski standard, njihovim otrokom pa boljšo prihodnost, kot jim bo kadarkoli na voljo pod Putinovo sfero vpliva. Z vojno v Ukrajini je manko kakršne koli kompetitivne vizije Putin tudi dokazal. Preteklost, prihodnost in sedanjost torej narekujejo državam bivšega sovjetskega prostora, da iz tega prostora čimprej pobegnejo.\n\nKar se raznih imperializmov tiče, bi jaz na mestu Ukrajincev tudi vzel tistega, ki za pridružitev zahteva široko podporo ljudstva, kot tistega, ki pride v državo s tanki in meče kasetne bombe na to isto ljudstvo (kar je, mimogrede, vojni zločin). Vraga, tudi če bi bil Rus, bi Vladimirja Putina takoj zamenjal za kakšen dodaten Starbucks na ulicah Moskve. Pumpkin spiced latte nudi boljši življenjski standard kot Putin, ne da bi ogrožal suverenost in teritorialno integriteto Rusije. In tudi če bi me skrbela erozija narodne kulture zavoljo zahodnih vplivov, bi lahko v ameriško kavo še zmeraj zlil en štamperle vodke. Čeprav glede na to, kako so ljudje stali v vrstah za McDonalds, preden so zlati loki za njih zaprli svoja vrata, morda nekaj pove o preferencah ruskega ljudstva, ne glede na Putinove javnomnenjske ankete.  \n\nA ruski državljan nima nikakršnih demokratičnih vzvodov, s katerimi bi vplival na politični sistem v lastni državi, o čemer pričajo tudi nedavni protivojni protesti, da ne omenjamo medijskega mrka, ki prepoveduje vojni reči vojna. (Primerjajte s protesti proti in medijskim poročanjem o iraški ali afganistanski vojni, na primer.) Največja, celo edina, prepreka med ruskim državljanom in kolikor toliko svobodnim življenjem pač ni NATO – ampak Vladimir Putin. In isto zdaj velja za ukrajinskega državljana.\n\nSkratka, splača se vprašati, ali NATO in Zahod res predstavljata grožnjo ruskemu ljudstvu in suverenosti Rusije, kot svojim državljanom zatrjuje domnevno patriotski Putin, ali pa predstavljata grožnjo Putinovi Rusiji in njegovemu mafijskemu državnemu aparatu.\n\nA če se Putin počuti ogroženega s strani zveze NATO, ima na voljo povsem moralno sprejemljivo obrambno strategijo, in sicer ponuditi vzhodno-evropskim državam boljše življenjske pogoje, višji življenjski standard, večjo varnost pod svojo sfero vpliva, kot bi jih imele te države na voljo pod \"zlobnim\" zahodnim imperijem. V tem primeru ima kot vodja svetovne velesile lahko kolikor hoče blažilne cone med njim in svojimi namišljenimi sovražniki. Ampak ali ima kdo kakršne koli iluzije, da je Putin to zmožen ponuditi? Če bi bil, te vojne ne bi bilo. Invazija na suvereno in neodvisno državo ter pobijanje civilistov v njej pa pač ni moralno sprejemljiva strategija; kot to ni bila ameriška invazija na Irak, če želite zadostiti \"kaj pa oni\" ugovoru. In mimogrede, Putin trdi, da so Ukrajinci in Rusi v bistvu \"isti narod.\" Sledeč tej teoriji torej trenutno za namen zaščite Rusov pred zunanjim sovražnikom pobija … Ruse? Precej nenavaden patriotizem.\n\nKljub temu nekateri ljudje ali prikimavajo Putinu, čeprav so bili vsi njegovi nedavni javni nastopi polni strateškega zavajanja in zgodovinskega revizionizma, ali pa pravijo, da ubogi avtokrat ob imperialističnih apetitih NATO-pakta ni imel druge izbire, kot da pobija ženske in otroke v sosednji državi. S tem dejansko pravijo, da ukrajinski državljan, ki si želi demokratično participacijo v lastni državi, varnost pred zgodovinsko agresivno Rusijo, ter upanje, da bodo njegovi otroci lahko živeli bolje, kot živi sam, pač nima te iste pravice in privilegija, ki smo ju imeli mi sami, ko smo se o tem demokratično odločali leta 2003. Češ, geografska lega njihove države jim ne daje niti pravice do nacionalne varnosti, medtem ko so Putinove varnostne skrbi bojda utemeljene in razumljive. Karkoli že NATO pomeni kje drugje po svetu, za Ukrajino pomeni predvsem varnost pred leviatanom na Vzhodu, ki se v preteklosti ni izkazal kot dobrohoten bratski narod, ampak vse prej kot genocidni imperator (spomnimo na Holodomor). Zanimivo, s kakšno lahkoto lahko nekateri ljudje pod varnim zavetjem NATO-letal obsodijo 44 milijonov ljudi na brezizhodno revščino in jih tako rekoč žrtvujejo na oltarju \"globalnega varnostnega ravnovesja.\"\n\n(Na hitro o tem ravnovesju: dolgo časa je bilo to ravnovesje sredi Berlina in južno dol prek Evrope. Danes v državah vzhodno od te ločnice ne bo slišati veliko teorij o tem, kako je NATO kriv za Putinova dejanja. Potem je bilo ravnovesje naenkrat nekje na vzhodni poljski meji, pa se globalni red ni zrušil. S pridružitvijo baltskih držav je bilo ravnovesje že na ruski meji, pa tudi ni nihče napadel Rusije, kljub njenemu šibkemu obrambnemu položaju. Zdi se, da je \"globalno varnostno ravnovesje\" precej fleksibilno, hočem reči.) \n\nPotem je tu še na videz zmeren in realpolitičen argument, da bi lahko Ukrajina vsaj delno popustila ruskim zahtevam in se obvezala k nevtralnosti, nato pa se počasi približevala Evropi, kar prav tako legitimira Putinovo invazijo. Za primer dobre prakse s tega naslova se seveda ponujata Švedska in Finska, obe nevtralni in obe visoko razviti EU državi. A splača se omeniti, da ima za razliko od nordijskih držav Ukrajina to geostrateško smolo, da so pri njih nedavno odkrili nahajališča naravnega plina, s katerimi bi lahko na evropskem energetskem trgu konkurirala Rusiji, ki je do sedaj uživala profitabilen status edine petrodržave na kontinentu. Tudi če se Ukrajina obveže k vojaški nevtralnosti, obstajajo ekonomski razlogi, zaradi katerih bo Putin želel Ukrajino ohraniti karseda revno in nezmožno razvijati kapacitete za črpanje tega resursa (kar je z aneksijo Krima in podporo separatistom v Donbasu počel zadnjih osem let), obenem pa s čim strožjim nadzorom nad ukrajinskim političnim sistemom poskrbeti, da tudi zahodne korporacije ne ponudijo tovrstnih uslug (kar je počel pred Majdanom). Kapitulacija in obveza k nevtralnosti tako Ukrajini ne omogočata ne približevanja Zahodu (npr. v obliki članstva v EU), ne izboljšanja življenjskega standarda.\n\nNazadnje, predvsem na zahodnoevropskem levem političnem polu se pojavlja argument tipa \"Putin je avtokrat, ampak\". Tovrstni argument sicer obsoja Putinovo invazijo, podpira protivojne pr\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Doubt", "start": 238, "end": 321}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 428, "end": 487}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 491, "end": 572}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 575, "end": 669}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 598, "end": 603}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 625, "end": 638}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 730, "end": 817}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 731, "end": 736}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 752, "end": 757}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 842, "end": 965}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1009, "end": 1093}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1129, "end": 1237}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1591, "end": 1655}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 1967, "end": 2096}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2241, "end": 2248}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2516, "end": 2603}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2516, "end": 2529}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2606, "end": 2697}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 2636, "end": 2695}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2666, "end": 2695}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 2699, "end": 2798}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2761, "end": 2798}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2818, "end": 2870}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2862, "end": 2870}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3111, "end": 3116}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3150, "end": 3154}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 3165, "end": 3213}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3259, "end": 3365}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3271, "end": 3326}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3384, "end": 3444}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 3384, "end": 3478}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3664, "end": 3700}, {"tag": "Red_Herring", "start": 3731, "end": 3791}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 3795, "end": 3895}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 4077, "end": 4259}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4208, "end": 4235}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 4271, "end": 4396}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4298, "end": 4308}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 4541, "end": 4620}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5065, "end": 5091}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5124, "end": 5344}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 5347, "end": 5396}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 5530, "end": 5608}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5615, "end": 5654}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 5657, "end": 5716}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 5657, "end": 5673}], "article_id": "448", "lang": "sl", "text": "Edini, ki bo preprečil tretjo svetovno vojno\n\nČlanstvo v evropskem vojaškem paktu, ki bi se temeljito razlikoval od interesov Nata, bi bilo verjetno za Rusijo spet zanimivo.\n\nKo Marsovci gledajo na naš planet, verjetno težko razumejo, da je vprašanje, s katerim potnim listom ali zastavo kdo maha, pomembnejše od življenja. Na tisoče ljudi umira zato, ker se eni na eni strani fronte streljajo s tistimi na drugi strani fronte. Nihče se ne vpraša, kje bi bilo življenje za te ljudi boljše.\n\nNaženejo jih ali pa se nekateri kar sami od sebe nastavljajo pred puške in granate. Če ni zastava vzrok za morijo, pa je lahko kakšna »božja« knjiga, ki je edina resnična in prava. Tak Marsovec, ki ničesar ne razume, bi morda pomislil, da »bedaki ubijajo druge bedake iz neumnih razlogov«, kot je izjavil pisatelj Robert Jordan.\n\nSeveda, saj Marsovec ne razume, kako pomembni so zaslužki vojaške industrije in vojni dobički, in ne razume »priložnosti«, ki se odprejo po vojni. Marsovec tudi težko razume, zakaj bi kdo uvedel sankcije proti drugi državi, s katerimi najbolj škodi sebi, ne pa tisti državi. Prav tako ne razume politika, ki trdi, da je »ustaviti vojno« zelo nevarno, čeprav na tisoče njegovih državljanov umira na fronti in v zaledju.\n\nOb vojni med Ukrajino in Rusijo se je poučno spomniti kubanske krize leta 1962. Grozila je jedrska vojna med ZDA in Sovjetsko zvezo (SZ). Kaj je bil takrat vzrok za konflikt? ZDA so leta 1961 svoje jedrske rakete jupiter namestile v Turčiji in Italiji, torej tik pred »vrata« SZ, kar so Sovjeti razumeli kot ogrožanje lastne varnosti. Sočasno je Cia pripravljala invazijo na Kubo in strmoglavljenje tamkajšnje vlade.\n\nAli vse to spominja na širjenje Nata na vzhod in vlogo, ki jo je Cia odigrala pri oranžni revoluciji leta 2004 ter zamenjavi vlade v Ukrajini? Tokrat Rusija ni namestila svojih jedrskih konic na Kubo, ampak je več let opozarjala, da širitev Nata tik pred svoja »vrata« razume kot ogrožanje lastne varnosti.\n\nPri kubanski krizi smo imeli srečo, saj sta se Kennedy in Hruščov dogovorila, da pod nadzorom ZN oba umakneta svoje jedrske konice. ZDA iz Turčije in Italije, SZ pa s Kube. Castro je izjavil, da ne bo sprejel novega orožja pod pogojem, da ZDA zagotovijo, da ne bodo izvedle invazije na Kubo. Državnika sta celo ugotovila, da je neposreden pogovor koristen, in sta leta 1963 vzpostavila medsebojno neposredno komunikacijsko linijo, v javnosti poznano kot rdeči telefon. Takrat ZDA na srečo niso izjavljale, da je treba SZ vojaško premagati.\n\nNi bilo pametnjakoviča, ki bi trdil, da je treba mir zagotoviti z več orožja in več oboroževanja. Znana je Kennedyjeva izjava: »Človeštvo mora končati vojno, preden vojna pokonča človeštvo.« Če bi sodobni zahodni politiki tedaj reševali kubansko krizo, bi bilo naše civilizacije takrat konec. Zahodni politiki pozive h končanju vojne danes označujejo za izdajstvo. Zaman čakamo na politika, ki bo preprečil tretjo svetovno vojno. Takega, ki bo v 24 urah končal vojno v Ukrajini, preprečil konflikte med Palestino in Izraelom, pomiril napetosti v Aziji in normaliziral odnose s Kitajsko. Ali obstaja tak junak?\n\nSamo en politik trdi, da je ta junak. Trump. »Sem edini, ki bom preprečil tretjo svetovno vojno,« izjavlja v svojih predvolilnih govorih. A EU, kjer so politiki prestrašeni in javno mnenje skrbno manipulirano, reagira na njegove obljube nerazsodno. Res se je Trump zlagal ali zavajal v svojem predsedniškem mandatu 30.573-krat, so prešteli pri Washington Postu, kar naj bi bilo 21-krat na dan. Žal te prakse, da bi šteli laži politikov, niso obvezne za vse politike, in zato ne vemo, ali je to veliko ali malo. Čutimo pa, da tudi drugi politiki niso imuni za laži ali dezinformacije. Pa tudi multinacionalke ne, posebej ko gre za nove oblike izkoriščanja delavcev in okolja.\n\nAli ni vseeno, če se politik zlaže 21-krat na dan, če le s svojo politiko prepreči vojne in uničenje? Ali bodo ZDA pod Trumpom izstopile iz pakta Nato in prispevale k njegovi razpustitvi? Ko je bil Varšavski pakt leta 1991 razpuščen, so mnogi zahtevali tudi razpustitev pakta Nato. Če bi se to zgodilo, ne bi bili priča širjenju Nata na vzhod, v članicah ne bi zapravljali toliko denarja za orožje in ne bi imeli svetovne norije oboroževanja. In manj bi bilo mrtvih.\n\nZdi se, da sta strah in posledično militarizem v EU zdaj tako razširjena, da se mnoge države ne bodo hotele odpovedati vojaškemu paktu. A vojaški pakt brez ZDA bi lahko imel popolnoma drugačne geopolitične cilje, druge voditelje in bi bil podrejen politiki, ne pa obratno. Vanj bi lahko sprejeli tudi Rusijo in s tem podprli obojestransko sinergijo interesov. Izkazalo se je, da se članice vojaškega pakta med seboj ne napadajo. Ali to zveni preveč utopistično? Leta 1991 je Rusija pisno obvestila Nato, da je njen dolgoročni cilj članstvo v paktu. Deset let kasneje je tudi Putin večkrat nakazal, da je naklonjen tej ideji. Članstvo v evropskem vojaškem paktu, ki bi se temeljito razlikoval od interesov Nata, bi bilo verjetno za Rusijo spet zanimivo.\n\nTrumpu očitajo upad liberalne demokracije. Toda demokracija upada tudi v EU. Ali res koga še preseneča, če se poskuša državni voditelj okoriščati, kot očitajo Trumpu, zaposluje svoje privržence, poskuša omejiti sodno oblast, ki bi mu lahko gledala pod prste, ali zaganja gospodarstvo z ukrepi, ki ne spoštujejo varovanja okolja?\n\nAli ni v vsakem politiku tudi nekaj teh lastnosti? Ni dvoma, da so pomembni svoboda, demokracija, varovanje okolja in kakovost življenja. A najprej je potreben mir in nato vse drugo. Naj Trump prepreči tretjo svetovno vojno in v enem dnevu konča vojno v Ukrajini, saj drugi politiki tega ne znajo niti nočejo.

Odmeven in uspešen Evropski projekt je na sporedu že 22 let! Sedem slovenskih občin je v projektu sodelovalo od samega začetka, kasneje se je priključila tudi večina drugih. Letos je projekt nosil ime Trajnostno povezani.\n\nNa spletni strani evropskega tedna mobilnosti najdemo naslov: »Kako je avtomobil postal sovražnik dobrega življenja?«. Avtu težko naložimo tako breme, lahko pa ga naložimo tistemu, ki ga vozi. Enako kot že leta govorimo, da je s prometnovarnostnega vidika narobe govoriti, da je avto povzročil prometno nesrečo. Je možno, se strinjam, a je sila redko. Voznik avtomobila jo.\n\nTežava je drugje – v tem, da smo se ljudje s pomočjo avtomobila, ki za svoje premikanje porablja fosilna goriva in s tem seveda onesnažuje okolje, v dobrem stoletju tako udobno, dobro in trajnostno povezali, da je prehod na drugačno obliko mobilnosti pač težek, predvsem pa postopen. Uporaba vojaške terminologije v tem primeru ne koristi kaj prida, ker sovražnik ni avto. Kot na primer ni hiša, ki ljudi v njej ogreva na kateri koli neobnovljiv vir energije. Če že, je sovražnik naš način življenja. Tega smo očitno razvili v smer, da zemlji več jemljemo, kot pa ji pustimo, da se lahko spet obnovi.\n\nTi šment\n\nNa spletni strani evropskega tedna mobilnosti je tudi naslov: »Zakaj je promet tak problem?«. Pod naslovom je kratek splošen opis in zavihek preberi več. Ko kliknemo nanj, pa se izpiše: »Ti šment. Stran ne obstaja.« Res ni tako enostavno, kot se zdi na začetku. Ni ene sistemske rešitve, vsaj ne še. Ne pomeni pa, da nič ne moremo narediti. Vsak lahko naredi kakšno spremembo v svojem življenju, ki bo bolj smotrno porabljala vire energije.

Še nekaj dni prej, 8. marca, bomo obeležili mednarodni dan žensk, ki ga bomo ženske letos preživele, obtežene z bremeni nove normalnosti. Biti ženska v pandemiji pomeni biti na prvi bojni liniji v borbi proti virusu v službi, izgubiti delo, zapustiti delo, ker moraš skrbeti za dom, družino, gospodinjstvo in obolele, delati od doma in zraven delati za dom, skrbeti za lastno zdravje in zdravje tistih, za katere moramo skrbeti, kadar zbolijo, biti doma prestrašena zaradi nasilja in negotove prihodnosti – nič nenavadnega, kajne?\n\nNa svetu je v sektorju zdravstva in socialnega varstva zaposlenih več kot 230 milijonov ljudi, med njimi je 67 % žensk, kljub temu pa moški, zaposleni v zdravstvu, zaslužijo 28 % več od žensk, pri čemer lahko dejstvu, da ženske opravijo manj delovnih ur, pripišemo 7-odstotno, dejstvu, da moški opravljajo drugo delovno mesto, pa 10-odstotno plačilno vrzel. 11-odstotna razlika v plačilu ostaja nepojasnjena, skrita v prepričanjih, da je žensko delo manj pomembno in manj vredno ter celo da je žensko primarno okolje drugje. Kje? Gotovo ne za omizjem Svetovne zdravstvene organizacije, za katerim sedi in odloča zgolj 20 % žensk.\n\nJe to okolje dom, kamor smo se v strahu pred virusom morali zapreti? V tem domu zdaj – če nismo ena izmed 47 milijonov žensk, ki jih bo zaradi izgube zaposlitve spričo epidemije doletela ekstremna revščina – delamo za službo, v kateri smo plačane manj od moškega sodelavca, in zraven opravljamo še več gospodinjskega in skrbstvenega dela, ki ga je doma nujno opraviti. Zanj seveda nismo plačane, smo pa ga že pred epidemijo opravljale nekajkrat pogosteje od moških, s katerimi si dom delimo.\n\nRaziskava Univerze v Sussexu je matere kot primarnega starša, na katerega pade vsa skrb za otroka v času zaprtja, identificirala v 74 % primerov, ta številka pa se ni bistveno znižala, če so te matere opravljale tudi delo od doma – takšnih je bilo 67 % žensk. Mogoče pa od doma sploh ne delamo – mogoče smo na čakanju ali pa zaradi dejstva, da se ženske koncentrirano zaposlujemo v podcenjenih sektorjih, ki jih bo kriza najbolj prizadela (turizem, gostinstvo, trgovina ipd.), in v nezanesljivih oblikah zaposlitve, svojega prihodka, ki bi nam omogočal neodvisnost, nimamo več. Postale smo ujete v odvisnost od drugega in o svoji prihodnosti razmišljamo omejeno, pravzaprav podrejeno. \n\nKako smo (pre)živele?\n\nŽe pred razglašeno epidemijo je po podatkih, ki jih je objavil NIJZ – torej v času pred porastom stisk, ki jih je povzročil ali poglobil covid-19, v Sloveniji pa jih je sprejemljivo reševati z zlorabo alkohola – čezmerno pilo 250.000 ljudi. Ker vsak tak človek prizadene štiri ljudi v svoji bližini, to pomeni, da smo v epidemijo, negotovost in vsesplošen stres vstopili z milijonom prebivalstva, ki posredno trpi zaradi alkoholizma – tudi takšni so domovi, v katere smo se zaprli.\n\nPo drugi strani ima 73 % Slovencev izkušnjo z nasiljem v družini. Za psihičnim nasiljem trpi več kot polovica žensk v Sloveniji, kot vemo, pa je vsaka druga do dopolnjenega 15. leta doživela fizično in/ali spolno nasilje – to je realna slika pravljičnosti slovenskih domov, ki postane še jasnejša, če dodamo podatek, da manj kot 40 % žensk, ki so žrtve nasilja, o tem spregovori s prijatelji ali družino, na formalne institucije, kakršna je denimo Policija, pa se obrne manj kot 10 % žrtev. Od kod takšne številke in kako kar naenkrat pride do strašne tragedije, ko pa sosedje po navadi nič ne vidimo in nič ne slišimo?\n\nSmo opazili porast nasilja nad ženskami, o katerem je poročala tako slovenska policija (20 %) kot nevladne organizacije, ki nudijo pomoč in podporo žrtvam v zadnjem obdobju? Oboji so ob tem opozarjali še na dejstvo, da je bilo ob prvih zaprtjih klicev manj, kot so pričakovali, kar bi nas moralo takrat še posebno skrbeti. Nam je (bilo) o stiskah, ki jih doživljamo vsak dan, dovoljeno govoriti, nas je kdo spodbudil, da se z njimi soočimo in prosimo za pomoč? Ali pa nam je bilo sporočeno, da moramo biti hvaležne za ta čas z družino, ki nam je bil podarjen, in da so virus in ukrepi ustvarili pogoje za pravljično idilo? Kakšna ženska pa si, če ne uživaš, kadar si doma? Kakšno družino si si ustvarila, če v njej nisi srečna?\n\nEno leto življenja v epidemiji je postreglo z neštetimi tekmovanji, kaj je najpomembnejša stvar, ki bi jo v epidemiji veljalo zaščititi, a le redkokdo je ob tem pomislil na to, da je v teh razmerah, ob tem zgodovinskem spominu in ob nevarnih praksah mnogih držav, ki se imajo za izvoznice demokracije in enakosti, a so izredne razmere izkoriščale za kršenje temeljnih pravic žensk, nujno potrebno zavarovati vse tiste korake, ki smo jih vsi – tako ženske kot moški in kot družba – napravili za to, da je naš položaj manj neenak. To kaže, v kako trdovratne patriarhalne vzorce mišljenja smo vpeti. Kakšna mati pa si, če se ti ne zdi dragocen vsak dodaten trenutek z otrokom?\n\nZakaj se moramo spreminjati ženske, namesto da bi spremenili sistem?\n\nOd žensk se pač pričakuje drugačno žrtvovanje v procesu reševanja vsakega problema, tudi če je ta problem svetovna družbeno-ekonomska kriza ali zdravstvena epidemija. Kot da ne bi z enako pozornostjo in enakimi očmi opazovali zdrsov na področju naših pravic, našega položaja na trgu dela, s tem naše (mogoče) svobode in naše vloge v partnerstvu in družini, se (pre)mnogim še vedno zdi, da ne bo nič tragičnega, če ženske iz epidemije izstopimo tako, da se vrnemo nazaj domov, k skrbi za druge. Tja, kamor smo bile poslane že večkrat in od koder se nato s težavo, čez kup ovir premikamo naprej.\n\nNaj nam bo zato dovoljeno, da vsaj ob 8. marcu, mednarodnem prazniku žensk, dnevu, ki obeležuje stoletja našega poguma in naše moči, ko smo iz ničesar počasi postajale nekdo – nekdo s pravicami, glasom,  zahtevami in vizijo – opozorimo na to, da bi bilo morebiti primerno že končno spremeniti kolesje tega sistema, ki nas na vsakem koraku poustvarja v drugotne, namesto da poslušamo tiste, ki nam pridigajo, da bi se morale spremeniti me same. Kakšna ženska pa si, če nimaš otrok in o tem vsem sodiš?\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 60, "end": 89}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 92, "end": 165}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 168, "end": 275}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 198, "end": 216}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 278, "end": 400}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 587, "end": 607}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 895, "end": 924}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1070, "end": 1144}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1070, "end": 1144}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1095, "end": 1115}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1218, "end": 1579}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1218, "end": 1265}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 1287, "end": 1324}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1464, "end": 1494}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1542, "end": 1579}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1582, "end": 1688}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1721, "end": 1737}], "article_id": "4482", "lang": "sl", "text": "Civilna iniciativa proti migrantskemu centru v Beli krajini brez obvestil ne more ukrepati\n\nPoti in načini tujcev, ki nezakonito prečkajo državno mejo, se spreminjajo. V zadnjih dneh je čedalje več ilegalnih migrantov spet zaznati na območju Občine Črnomelj, v krajih ob Kolpi. V zadnjih petih dneh (od petka zjutraj do danes, torka, 7. februarja, zjutraj), so na tem območju prijeli kar 117 migrantov.\n\nPrijeli so jih v krajih: Zilje, Vinica, Suhor, Stari trg ob Kolpi, Preloka, Pribinci, Draga pri Sinjem vrhu, Dolnji Suhor pri Vinici, Žuniči, Sečje selo, Drenovec in Sodevci.\n\nPorast nezakonitih migrantov je zaznala tudi Civilna iniciativa proti migrantskemu centru v Beli krajini. Na svoji Facebook strani so zapisali: “Zadnje dneve se zopet obračate na nas, saj naj bi se zelo povečalo število videnih skupin po obmejnih belokranjskih vaseh. Obveščajte nas, tukaj ali v zasebno sporočilo. Brez tega ne moremo ukrepati.”\n\nPodatkom civilne iniciative pritrjujejo tudi v Policijski upravi Novo mesto. Dejstvo pa je, tako je slišati iz obmejnih belokranjskih vasi, da policija ne zaznava vseh nezakonitih migrantov, ki gredo skozi njihove vasi. V policiji pa navajajo, da jih je treba o zaznanih gibanjih obvestiti. Migranti so tudi tu, kot kaže, zamenjali taktiko. Še pred nekaj časa so se usedli in sami poiskali policijo. Zdaj je drugače.\n\nMigranti zaenkrat ne povzročajo težav, kot so jih bili domačini vajeni pred časom. Vendar pa je tudi lahko zavajajoče. Dejstvo je namreč, da so vodeni. Za njimi ali med njimi pa lahko pridejo tudi drugače misleči posamezniki in skupine. Ker gre za območje, ki bo s pomladjo in poletjem tudi turistično zaživelo, je treba biti pozoren tudi na to.\n\nZato, kdor koli opazi tujce, ilegalne migrante, na svojem območju, naj pokliče policijo in hkrati obvesti civilno iniciativo.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 0, "end": 9}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 360, "end": 370}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start":

In globoka hvaležnost gasilcem, vojski, prostovoljcem, civilni zaščiti in sploh vsem, ki pomagajo ljudem v nesreči.\n\nNaši predniki so takim katastrofam rekli sodni dan. Bog (za ateiste narava) da nam sodi. Za naše pregrehe. Za katere? Kdo je kriv? Kaj lahko naredimo? To se sprašujemo. Je kriv referendum o vodah? Je kriva politika? Je kriv pohlep? Kapitalizem? Po neki raziskavi Episcentra večina meni, da smo za neurja \"krivi ljudje\". Zahodni pokrščanski človek je na splošno rad česa kriv: suženjstva, lakote v Afriki ali pa \"podnebne krize\".\n\nSredstva za samopomoč\n\nIskanje vzroka ali krivca je zelo človeški način za soočanje s problemom. Najdba psihološko pomaga, tudi če je odkritje napačno. Drugo, kar psihološko pomaga, je, da nekako ukrepamo, da imamo občutek, da imamo na zadeve vpliv. Recimo zvonimo proti toči. Ali molimo. Ali namesto plastičnih uporabimo papirnate slamice. Vse to ima terapevtski učinek na človeka.\n\nKlavdija Vrečar Kot piše Judea Pearl v knjigi \"The Book of Why\" je kavzalnost tisto področje človekovega intelekta, kjer umetna inteligenca še močno zaostaja za človeško. Hočemo, da imajo zadeve vzrok. Da ni naključij. Tiste malo manj inteligentne, pa nekaj bolj človeške, pa ne zanima toliko, zakaj se je nekaj zgodilo, ampak koga bi lahko okrivili.\n\nPa so spet tisti, ki jih imamo za malo manj inteligentne (spomnimo se jih iz horoskopa in covida), odkrili, da so krivi programi tajnih služb, ki v Italiji v podzemnih tovarnah delajo točo in jo pošiljajo v Slovenijo. In da pomaga razliti malo kisa okrog hiše. Tisti, ki se imajo za bolj inteligentne, pa so razložili, da si tisti prvi izmišljajo zarote, ker niso pripravljeni sprejeti krivde za vreme nase. Da je namreč kriv njihov oplov dizel, ki ima toplogredne izpuste. In da bi pomagalo, če bi se več vozili s kolesom.\n\nTežava je, da imata kis in kolo približno enak učinek. Človek se skozi tisočletja ni veliko spremenil. Sodni dan je še vedno sodni dan.\n\nOtroške solze za boljše vreme, prvič\n\nSlabo vreme so si primitivna ljudstva razlagala kot jezo bogov. Ameriški Maji so verjeli, da morajo za ohranjanje ravnovesja v naravi darovati kri in žrtvovati ljudi. Živim so pulili srca ali jim odirali kožo. Otroke so metali v kraška brezna s sladko vodo, da bi bilo več dežja. Ali pa so jim brusili zobe in lomili kosti, da bi zbrali čim več otroških solz in potem te darovali bogovom − tudi zaradi dežja.\n\nKo so se konec srednjega veka v Evropi zgodile podnebne spremembe − ne, ni bilo topleje, ohladilo se je −, krščanski človek krivde ni pripisal muhavosti bogov (naš Bog je ljubosumen, ne pa muhast), ampak je iskal krivca. Tudi takrat so se našli taki, ki so trdili, da sta mraz in pozeba nastala zaradi grešnosti ljudi. Ne, takrat ne, ker bi se preveč vozili z avtomobili in se prevečkrat s toplo vodo prhali.\n\nKljub morda drugačnim občutkom je letošnje poletje spet eno najbolj vročih v zgodovini meritev.

Tudi tistim iz Slivnice. Študija Wolfganga Behringerja (\"Climactic Change and Witch-Hunting: The Impact of the Little Ice Age on Mentalities\" Climate Change 43, No. 1,1999, 335−351) je na primer pokazala, da je vrhunec dejavnosti lova na čarovnice v Nemčiji sovpadal z najhladnejšo fazo male ledene dobe.\n\nOtroške solze za boljše vreme, drugič\n\nNekateri tudi danes ugotavljajo, da ni več ravnotežja v naravi. Da grešni človek povzroča slabo vreme, da je treba ukrepati in da bodo potrebne žrtve. Da pa imamo samo še pet let časa. So rekli pred petimi leti. Letos spet pravijo, da imamo samo pet let.\n\nOpogumljeni s slavo Grete Thunberg Mladi za podnebno pravičnost podnebja ne izboljšujejo s solzami bolečine, ampak s solzami strahu in jeze. Da če ne bomo ukrepali, bodo posledice katastrofalne. Ženske, ki se jim zdi napredno, da nimajo otrok (ker jih moški tudi nimajo), so našle izgovor, da jih ne bodo imele in se bodo tako borile proti podnebnim spremembam. Jih bodo imeli pa kje drugje. Otroke.\n\nKatastrofisti so znali povedati, da so letos v Sloveniji podnebne spremembe povzročile prve žrtve. Hude ure od nekdaj povzročajo žrtve. Zadnja leta jih je kvečjemu manj. Globalna statistika je jasna − zaradi ekstremnega vremena je človeških žrtev čedalje manj. Ker smo čedalje bogatejši.\n\nLeve in desne zablode\n\nLevica na podlagi pravih informacij o podnebnih spremembah predlaga nespametne ukrepe. Desnica na podlagi lažnih informacij predlaga razume ukrepe. (Levico in desnico je tukaj treba tule jemati zelo, zelo na okroglo.) Prava informacija je, da se planet segreva tudi zaradi dejavnosti ljudi.\n\nNespametno pa je zaradi tega opustiti razvojni model, ki dviga standard ljudi in odpravlja revščino. Nespametno je ukinjati kapitalizem, ki edini lahko kreira bogastvo, ki je potrebno za prilagajanje spremembam in ustvarjanje inovacij za čistejše tehnologije.\n\nLažne so vse mogoče za lase privlečene teorije, od tega, da ni segrevanja, da je bilo pred x 00.000 leti topleje, pa do tega, da segrevanje z dejavnostjo ljudi nima nič.\n\nJe pa razumno, da se drugačni klimi prilagajamo. Pametno je omogočiti podjetnikom, da inovirajo − da bo čista energija tudi brez posegov države cenovno konkurenčna. In da razvijejo geoinženirske rešitve, ki bi lahko ohladile planet − če se izkaže, da je toplejši slabši.\n\nZanikovalec podnebnega prevrevanja\n\nAvtor tega zapisa ni zanikovalec globalnega segrevanja. Je pa zanikovalec podobnega katastrofizma in podnebnega prevrevanja, kot nas poskušajo prestrašiti. Spremembe so, problem je, ni pa nerešljiv. Nič ne kaže, da ne bi na planetu v prihodnje še več ljudi še boljše živelo.\n\nSta zgolj opozarjanje na podnebne spremembe in protestiranje dovolj? | Foto: Getty Images Sta zgolj opozarjanje na podnebne spremembe in protestiranje dovolj? Foto: Getty Images Mnogo manj pozornosti je treba namenjati raznim Gretam in društvom mladih in starih za podnebno pravičništvo. Probleme bodo rešili inovatorji, ne demonstranti. Razen če je problem, kot sem tudi že slišal, da je ljudi preveč. Tega pa znajo rešiti tudi demonstranti.\n\nPrilagajanje je zapostavljeno, ker nazadnjaki ne verjamejo, da se podnebne spremembe dogajajo (in ne bi naredili nič), naprednjakom pa se zdi, da kolikor bo slabše, toliko lažje bo klimo mogoče izkoristiti za svetovno revolucijo (in ne bi naredili nič). In smo brali, da klime niso rešitev in da se je nova vlada odpovedala urejanju vodotokov iz evropskih sredstev.\n\nSkratka\n\nKdo je torej kriv za vremensko katastrofo? Ne, niso ne čarovnice ne tovarne toče. Tudi ni sosed, ki ne ločuje odpadkov. Tudi si niste sami krivi, ker še kar kurite centralno kurjavo na olje. Ni prišla sodba sodnega dne zaradi naših grehov do narave. Imeli smo pač smolo. Nihče ni kriv.\n\nLahko pa vsak kaj naredi. Lahko na hišni prag potresete pepel, razlijete kis okrog hiše, v gnoj zapičite narobe obrnjene vile, prevrnete stole v hiši, vržete mačko v jezero, nehate jesti govedino, se več vozite s kolesom, se redkeje prhate s toplo vodo, uporabljate kosmat pribor iz furnirja namesto plastičnega ali pa plešete, če vas to pomirja in izpolnjuje.\n\nAli pa pokrijete nasade s protitočnimi mrežami, zgradite nadstrešek za avto, sklenete zavarovanje, bolj natančno spremljate radarsko sliko. Lahko pritisnete na oblast, da uredi vodotoke, zagotovi vodi več prostora in malo manj liberalno dovoljuje graditi, kjer pametni ljudje nekoč niso gradili.\n\nLahko tudi izbirate politike, ki bodo počeli razmeroma poceni stvari, ki imajo velik učinek na obvladovanje vremenskih neprilik jutri, in ne tistih, ki bi ukazovale pregrešno drage omejitve, ki bodo morebiti nekaj malega ohladile planet čez 50 ali 100 let.\n\nNaloga vsake generacije je, da poskrbi, da svet, ki ga je podedovala od prednikov, še boljšega zapusti svojim potomcem. Da bodo imeli boljšo hrano, boljšo pijačo, boljše zdravstvo, boljše šole, boljša domovanja, boljše ceste, boljše delo. In seveda tudi boljše in varnejše okolje za življenje.\n\nŠe vsaka generacija do zdaj je ravnala tako in mi moramo tudi. Še posebej zdaj, ko je pol Slovenije pod vodo, moramo verjeti, da jo bomo nazaj zgradili boljšo, kot je bila. In jo tudi bomo.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3, "end": 21}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 67, "end": 73}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 76, "end":

Vladimir Putin je po Hitlerju in Stalinu zdaj prvi evropski politik, ki je po padcu berlinskega zidu pobil daleč največ ljudi doslej. Toda v ameriški reviji The New Republic so se kljub njegovi grozljivi statistiki iz Ukrajine odločili, da bo najhujši vojni zločinec leta 2023 vendarle izraelski premier Benjamin Netanjahu, okrutni morilec Palestincev v Gazi, kjer med žrtvami prevladujejo predvsem otroci in ženske.\n\nGaza se pod izraelskimi bombami pred očmi vsega sveta spreminja v apokaliptično mrtvašnico. Število mrtvih je v prvih dneh novega leta že preseglo mejo 22.000. V nevladni organizaciji Save the Children opozarjajo, da je v Gazi umrlo že več otrok kot v vseh vojaških spopadih zadnjih treh let skupaj. Za izraelske generale so palestinski otroci povsem legitimne tarče. Nobenega usmiljenja nimajo za nikogar. Dokaz več, da gre v resnici za načrtno uničenje vsega, kar živi in stoji v tem največjem zaporu na svetu.\n\nKonvencija o genocidu za Izrael ne obstaja\n\nZa mnoge analitike gre v tej vojni zdaj za šolski primer genocida. In to v času, ko je bila pred dobrimi 75 leti, natančneje 9. decembra 1948, sprejeta konvencija Združenih narodov o genocidu. Na zasedanju Generalne skupščine ZN je bila tistega zgodovinskega dne potrjena soglasno. Brez enega samega vzdržanega glasu ali glasu proti.\n\n\"Ta vojna je nekaj posebnega tudi zato, ker vojni zločinci zelo redko tako odkrito in javno napovedujejo, kaj je njihov cilj. Brez vsakršnih skrivalnic in zanikanj. Izraelska soldateska zdaj počne ravno to,\" pravi profesor John Cox z Univerze Severne Karoline, kjer vodi center za holokavst, genocid in študije človekovih pravic.\n\nZa lakoto trpi že pol milijona ljudi\n\nNjihov plan, ki močno spominja na nacistično politiko iztrebljanja, je zelo jasen: popolno uničenje infrastrukture, vseh zdravstvenih ustanov, blokada dostopa do vode, hrane in goriva. Cilj je torej popolnoma izčrpati in izstradati palestinsko prebivalstvo. Po ocenah Združenih narodov za lakoto zdaj trpi že najmanj pol milijona prebivalcev Gaze. Ker ni čiste vode, se v Gazi širijo nalezljive bolezni.\n\nNa posnetku iz soseske Šedžaija – zgodilo se je osmega decembra lani – je lepo videti, kako je izraelska vojska zažgala tovornjak, ki je v Gazo pripeljal hrano in vodo. To je povsem v skladu z znano izjavo obrambnega ministra Joava Gallanta, da v Gazo ne smejo ne elektrika ne hrana ne voda in ne gorivo. In tudi v skladu z nedavnim jeznim izpadom ministra za (ne)varnost Itamarja Ben Gvira, ki se je razjezil na upravo izraelskih zaporov, ker da palestinskih zapornikov v ječah ne stradajo dovolj …\n\nV Gazi zaradi takšne genocidne politike izraelskih oblasti ni več nobenih možnosti za preživetje. Ali smrt zaradi bomb, bolezni in lakote ali pa odhod iz Gaze. Za vedno.\n\nNova palestinska nakba\n\nGlavni arhitekt tega peklenskega uničevalnega načrta je seveda Benjamin Netanjahu, premier z najdaljšim stažem v izraelski zgodovini, ki bo oktobra letos dopolnil 75 let. Za slabo leto je mlajši od konvencije ZN o genocidu …\n\nToda za izvedbo uničevanja ne skrbi sam, ampak ima pri tem vrsto nadvse brutalnih pomočnikov. Minister za kmetijstvo Avi Dihter je že novembra govoril o novi nakbi, arabski besedi za katastrofo, ki je Palestino doletela 1948, ob nastanku izraelske države, ko je moralo svoja ognjišča zapustiti več kot 750.000 Palestincev.\n\nTa zgodba se zdaj v resnici ponavlja. Pred očmi vsega sveta, ki molči tako, kot je molčal takrat. Ajelet Šaked, nekdanja notranja in pravosodna ministrica, je denimo predlagala, da bi Izrael po uničenju Gaze moral pritisniti na države po vsem svetu, da bi sprejele Palestince. Vsaka od 20.000 do 50.000 pregnancev.  \n\nDani Danon, nekdanji izraelski veleposlanik v Združenih narodih in tesni zaveznik Benjamina Netanjahuja, je ponosno oznanil, da se je nanj obrnilo že več latinskoameriških in afriških držav, ki so voljne sprejeti izgnance iz Gaze. Vsi bi od tod seveda odšli prostovoljno, je cinično pojasnjeval Danon.\n\nNa \"prostovoljni\" način so Jude iz varšavskega geta nekoč odpravljali nacisti. Tistim, ki so bili pripravljeni takoj oditi, so ponujali tri štruce kruha in kilogram marmelade, je v svoji knjigi zapisal Marek Edelman, eden od voditeljev vstaje v varšavskem getu. Za prostovoljni odhod se je takrat javilo toliko Judov, da jih ni bilo mogoče spraviti na vlake.\n\nVsi so seveda končali v taboriščih smrti, je dodal Edelman.\n\n\"Prostovoljna\" izselitev\n\nPodoben načrt zdaj Judi pripravljajo za \"prostovoljni\" odhod več kot dveh milijonov prebivalcev Gaze. Na svetu ni ta hip nikogar, ki bi si Izraelce upal ustaviti. Ne Joe Biden, ne Bruselj. Še več. Po nekaterih informacijah naj bi bil posrednik v pogovorih s tujimi državami za \"prostovoljno preselitev\" Palestincev celo nekdanji britanski premier Tony Blair, znan po svoji korumpiranosti, ki pa je te govorice odločno zanikal. Toda kjer je dim, je tudi ogenj. In kjer so Izraelci, tam ni več (živih) Palestincev.\n\n Kdaj bo Netanjahu sedel v Haagu?\n\nGaza je, kot kaže razplet dogajanja, obsojena na to, da bo zravnana z zemljo. Uničevanju ni videti konca. A kljub temu se v zahodnem svetu še ni pojavil politik, ki bi Netanjahuju, zločincu brez primere, v obraz zabrusil, da bo za zločine prej ali slej treba odgovarjati. Joe Biden je rusko agresijo na Ukrajino denimo razglasil za genocid, pred tragedijo v Gazi pa si z neznosno lahkotnostjo vztrajno zapira oči.\n\nKot prva je izraelsko vlado zaradi genocida v Gazi na Meddržavnem sodišču v Haagu zdaj prijavila Južna Afrika. Kdo bo naslednji, ki se ji bo pridružil v zahtevi po preiskavi in sojenju? Morda Slovenija?

Ženska potrebuje transparentno informacijo, da se v njej razvija človeško bitje, ki mu bo s splavom odvzeto življenje\n\nV ponedeljek so v parku Zvezda poleg Kongresnega trga organizatorji Pohoda za življenje postavili 190 zastavic, ki simbolizirajo 190 šolskih razredov otrok, ki jim vsako leto življenje odvzame postopek splava. Organizatorji so dogodek poimenovali dan tihega spomina na te otroke, z zastavicami pa simbolično pokazali, koliko teh otrok je.\n\nTihi spomin je prekinil incident, ko je več mladih deklet zastavice pometalo po tleh. Podrle bi tudi transparent, ki je obveščal, za kaj gre pri akciji, če ga ne bi eden od prostovoljcev Pohoda za življenje prijel in s tem preprečil, da bi ga zrušili. Posnetek dogajanja je zaokrožil po družbenih omrežjih in začeli so se vrstiti odzivi, tudi posledice. Ena takih je denimo, da je predsednica republike Nataša Pirc Musar iz svojega mladinskega posvetovalnega odbora odslovila Saro Štiglic, eno izmed aktivistk, ki je podirala zastavice. Primerna in normalna posledica za destruktivno obnašanje.\n\nCelovito in transparentno informiranje\n\nManj normalni pa so odzivi, denimo stranke Levica, ki jih je presenetila novica, da je mlada aktivistka zaradi mirne, nenasilne in simbolne akcije za obrambo pravice do splava izgubila svetovalno mesto pri predsednici republike. Ne le Levica, da je žrtev v resnici Štigličeva, je prepričana tudi Nika Kovač, ki pravi, da zastavice v parku Zvezda predstavljajo tiho in sistematično nasilje. Nadalje se v odzivu zavzame za pravico do splava in poudari pomembnost dostopnih in transparentnih informacij o splavu ter poudari, da ne sme nihče pritiskati na ženske, ki se odločajo za splav. Za tiho in sistematično nasilje označi tudi oglase, transparente, molitve pred porodnišnico in podobno.\n\nPrav zanimiva je ta kontradiktornost Kovačeve, ko se hkrati zavzema za informiranost žensk glede splava in vse, ki informirajo, označi za nasilneže.\n\nGlede informiranja se vsekakor z Niko Kovač strinjam. Prav je, da Slovenke vedo, da je splav v Sloveniji legalen in da ga opravlja ginekološka klinika. Do desetega tedna se opravi na zahtevo, kasneje pa s soglasjem komisije. A to še zdaleč niso transparentne in dostopne informacije.\n\nPrav in edino pošteno je tudi, da dekle, ki razmišlja o splavu, dobi informacijo, da se v njej razvija človeško bitje, ki mu bo s postopkom splava odvzeto življenje, oz. konkretneje – bo brutalno umorjen z izstradanjem v primeru kemičnega splava oz. z razkosanjem v primeru kirurškega splava. Prav je tudi, da ve, da obstajajo skupine, ki ji bodo pomagale pri vzgoji, če bo otroka obdržala, in tudi pari, ki bodo z velikim veseljem posvojili in ljubeče vzgajali njenega otroka, v kolikor njegovega življenja ne bo končala s splavom, če sama tega ne zmore ali želi.\n\nTransparentno informiranje ženski pove tudi, da splav za žensko predstavlja hudo travmo, da je po umetnem splavu večja verjetnost spontanega splava v kasnejših nosečnostih, da splav pogosto povzroča depresijo, poveča samomorilnost, pri večini žensk pa kasneje tudi obžalovanje. A če so že zastavice v spomin na umrle v splavu za nekatere nasilje, kako naj se ženska potem sploh celovito informira?\nHuda travma\n\nŠele resnično celostno informiranje omogoča svobodno odločitev. Gibanja za življenje, še posebej v Sloveniji, se zavedajo, kako huda travma je splav, zato žensk, ki so ga storile, nikakor ne označujejo za morilke ali kaj podobnega. Tega od njih ne boste slišali. Zavedajo se, da so prav one, takoj za njihovimi otroki, največje žrtve postopkov splava, saj travmo, ki jim je od tega ostala, nosijo celo življenje. Še več, prav zaradi nastrojenosti aktivistk, kot sta Kovačeva in Štigličeva, pogosto o svoji travmi celo težko spregovorijo. Da jim bodo prisluhnili, brez obsojanja, pa obljubljajo v več pro-life organizacijah, ki delujejo pri nas.\n\nZastavice v spomin na pred rojstvom umrle otroke tako še zdaleč niso nasilje. Je pa nasilje akcija, ki ta spomin ruši, tepta, če hočete. Zato vprašanje za Niko Kovač – kako na to teptanje spomina gledajo vse ženske, ki so utrpele splav, pa njihovim otrokom ne dovolite niti spomina, pač pa ga označujete za nasilje?\n\nZanimiv je tudi odziv profesorice Fakultete za družbene vede Metke Mencin, ki prav tako hvali povzročiteljice incidenta, češ da z rušenjem instalacije dekleta niso odrekala pravice do izražanja ter da je neprimerno, da se pusti na miru tiste, ki problematizirajo liberalno zakonodajo. Da za svojimi dejanji stoji, je zapisala tudi Sara Štiglic, ki ne razume, zakaj jo je predsednica odslovila iz mladinskega posvetovalnega odbora.\n\nKdo vodi državo in vzgaja prihodnje generacije\n\nDogajanje pa opozarja tudi na radikalizacijo, ki smo ji priča v naši državi. Nika Kovač namreč vodi strateški svet za preprečevanje sovražnega govora. Metka Mencin poučuje na Univerzi v Ljubljani socialno in politično psihologijo ter identiteto, njen sin, Vid Čeplak Mencin pa je bil skupaj s Štigličevo član sveta predsedničinega posvetovalnega odbora in je po odslovitvi Štigličeve tudi sam protestno odstopil. Tretji član je svetnik Gibanja Svoboda. Zdaj ima tako predsednica odlično priložnost, da ob popolnitvi izpraznjenih mest poskrbi tudi za nekoliko večjo svetovnonazorsko pluralnost svojih mladih svetovalcev.\n\nCelotna narodna skupnost pa ima priložnost, da razmisli, kakšno vrednost daje človeškemu življenju. Ga bomo res za lastno ugodje nasilno odstranili ali sprejeli in varovali? To so težke odločitve, boleče, še posebej za marsikoga, ki se je že odločil, še posebej, če to odločitev obžaluje. Zato je res ključno informiranje o vseh vidikih, tudi pomoči pri soočanju s posttravmatskim sindromom.\n\nGovoriti o bolečih dejstvih ni nasilje\n\nNekatera dejstva so boleča. Govorjenje in informiranje o njih pa zaradi tega še ni nasilje. Kot ni nasilje govoriti o holokavstu, suženjstvu in nasilju nad ženskami, pa to še zdaleč ni prijetno. V svobodni in demokratični družbi se o teh stvareh pogovarjamo. In če na podlagi dejstev kdo pride do kakšnih spoznanj, mu pri soočanju z njimi pomagamo in jih ne prikrivamo za njegovo domnevno udobje. Ali še več, zagovornikom pravice do življenja a priori vzamemo legitimnost nastopanja in zagovarjanja svojega stališča, kot to ena za drugo zdaj počnejo stranke vladne koalicije.\n\nZagovornice splava so tudi vedno dobrodošle, da svoje stališče argumentirano zagovarjajo. V odprti razpravi lahko pridemo do novih spoznanj in boljše ureditve, kot jo imamo v tem trenutku. Ampak to se ne počne s teptanjem zastavic, temveč z argumenti. Razen če te je preveč strah, da bi, podobno kot pred stoletji in desetletji suženjstvo in holokavst, tudi končevanje življenj nerojenih in ostarelih postalo oz. ostalo za večino ljudi nekaj nepredstavljivega.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 792, "end": 818}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1486, "end": 1506}], "article_id": "4486", "lang": "sl", "text": "V Sloveniji se tudi uradno končuje epidemija covida-19\n\nUraden preklic epidemije ne pomeni tudi konca bolezni\n\nKončuje se epidemija novega koronavirusa, ki jo je Slovenija razglasila 12. marca.

Obe navedeni dejstvi se marsikomu zdita kontroverzni, a kot bomo videli, sta še kako prozorni.\n\nA najprej na kratko k stanju na fronti, ki ostaja nespremenjeno: ukrajinska protiofenziva počasi napreduje. Poudarek je na počasi, saj glede na verodostojna poročila včasih govorimo o napredku v smislu nekaj deset metrov, včasih o kakšnem kilometru. Še vedno se pozna nezmožnost Zahoda, da bi zagotovil zadostno količino artilerijskega streliva za ugodnejši potek osvoboditve.\n\nZadnje čase se sicer vse več govori o večjih dobavah zahodnih lovskih letal, s katerimi bi ob primerni onesposobitvi zaenkrat še dokaj dobro delujoče ruske zračne obrambe vzpostavili premoč v zraku ter tako odprli pot kopenskim prodorom. A časovnice so še neznane in glede na bližajočo se jesen bi od omenjene kombinacije letos težko pričakovali večje uspehe na terenu. \n\nSedaj pa k »zanimivejšemu« delu dogajanja: je Prigožin živ ali mrtev, in če je res slednje, kdo temu botruje? Kot smo že pojasnjevali v enem od prejšnjih prispevkov, so se ob poročanju o strmoglavljenju njegovega letala pojavile mnoge teorije. Pojdimo od manj do bolj verjetnih.\n\nPrvič, Prigožin je mrtev, letalo pa so sestrelili Ukrajinci. Ta teorija ne drži vode, saj bi, če bi Ukrajina lahko sestreljevala letala tako daleč od svojega ozemlja, sestrelila še marsikaj drugega, obenem pa bi Prigožina Ukrajinci eliminirali že prej.\n\nDrugič, Prigožin je uprizoril svojo smrt in se umika iz javnega življenja. To bi sicer bilo verjetno, a glede na njegovo upornost in kritike kremeljskega režima s predsednikom Putinom na čelu je daleč najverjetnejša teorija, da je bila sestrelitev naročena s strani ruskih oblasti. Prigožin je Putina s svojim upornim pohodom pošteno ponižal. In vemo, da Putin ne odpušča. Treba je dati zgled ostalim.\n\nKot se je nedavno pošalil ameriški sekretar za obrambo Anthony Blinken: kot ima NATO politiko odprtih vrat, ima Rusija politiko odprtih oken, in z mirno vestjo lahko verjamemo, da se je Prigožin pridružil desetinam vplivnih Rusov, ki so si drznili nasprotovati carju.\n\nS tem, ko je preminil tudi sam Wagner, torej ustanovitelj skupine Dimitrij Utkin, je neonacistična plačanska vojska tako rekoč obglavljena. Videti je, da ji ne preostane drugega, kot da se vključi v redne (belo)ruske strukture, profesionalni del pa bo po pričakovanjih ostal v Afriki, kjer Rusija za svoje interese potrebuje nadzor nad surovinami ter po potrebi zaneti kakšno vojno, kar so prvotne naloge Wagnerja. \n\nNekaj o slovenski (ne)iskrenosti pri podpori Ukrajini\n\nNazadnje pa še k tretji temi: Slovenija se je pridružila izjavi G7 o podpori Ukrajini, s čimer smo uradno obsodili rusko agresijo na svojo sosedo ter podprli ozemeljsko celovitost države. Ob tem izkazujemo podporo tudi iniciativi G7, preko katere naj bi njene članice Ukrajini pomagale pri razvoju vojaških kapacitet in kibernetske varnosti. S tem je Slovenija kot država jasno in glasno opustila retoriko »v vojni ni zmagovalcev« ter kako je za vse kriv Zahod, ki se bojda širi proti materi Rusiji. Smo na strani Ukrajine in niti slučajno Rusije. \n\nVse lepo in prav, osebno nova stališča brezpogojno podpiram. Če pa jih sprejema slovenska vlada, človek podvomi v iskrenost. Spomnimo se Golobovega bruseljskega lapsusa, Kučanovih pisem ter pretresenosti Fajonove ob vohunski aferi. Trenutne zunanjepolitične odločitve v zvezi z Ukrajino so sicer smele, pa vendar: ali odražajo intimno opcijo vladajočih? \n\nPrej bi rekel, da gre za neko deklarativno držo, s katero se vlada trudi pomiriti Zahod. Težko se je namreč znebiti občutka, da kljub vsem lepim besedam v dejanjih marsikdaj prevlada intimna predanost vladajočih Rusiji, bodisi v poslu, financah ali obveščevalni dejavnosti in še čem. Če povzamem: čeprav govorimo za Ukrajino, na omenjenih področjih lahko obilno pomagamo Rusiji. Več od lepih besed bi pomenilo pošteno čiščenje vpliva ruske sfere moči v naši državi.\n\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 17, "end": 22}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 251, "end": 256}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 475, "end": 674}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 811, "end": 891}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 909, "end": 1081}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1084, "end": 1163}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1168, "end": 1243}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1231, "end": 1243}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1713, "end": 1737}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1741, "end": 1857}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1860, "end": 2017}], "article_id": "4488", "lang": "sl", "text": "Začetek podnebne fronte\n\nPodnebna ljudska skupščina je izrazila nezadovoljstvo nad posodobljeno verzijo nacionalnega energetskega in podnebnega načrta\n\nMladi za podnebno pravičnost in druge okoljske ter delavske organizacije so se povezale v podnebno fronto, danes pa so pred prostori vlade organizirali Podnebno ljudsko skupščino, kjer so od vlade zahtevali bolj ambiciozne cilje pri reševanju podnebne krize, predvsem v nacionalnem energetskem in podnebnem načrtu (NEPN).\n\nVlada je namreč ravno v času skupščine sprejemala posodobljeno verzijo NEPN, ki pa ne sledi zavezujočim ciljem pariškega podnebnega sporazuma in po mnenju skupščine ne upošteva resnosti okoljske krize. Vlado pozivajo »k dopolnitvi in spremembam načrta na način, da se upošteva strokovna mnenja, okoljske organizacije in širšo javnost«, saj je bila pri oblikovanju sedanjega NEPN civilna družba popolnoma zapostavljena. Zavračajo tudi javna posvetovanja, ki jih je pred sprejetjem NEPN organizirala vlada, saj »služijo sama sebi in pristojnim omogočajo izkazovanje zgolj simboličnega sodelovanja z javnostjo«. Dodajajo, da vlada izmed njihovih 200 predlogov ni upoštevala praktično nobenega. \n\nZahtevajo povišanje podnebnih ciljev, ki bodo lahko preprečili podnebni zlom, in upoštevanje pariškega podnebnega sporazuma, ki predvideva znižanje emisij za vsaj 65 odstotkov do leta 2030 glede na leto 2005. Želijo večji poudarek na varovanju narave in biodiverzitete, »ki je ključni dejavnik v blaženju podnebnih sprememb.

O nekaterih dogodkih se včasih več let ni mogoče pogovarjati, ker so nas, ko so se zgodili, tako izčrpali, tako obremenili, da nam je pogosto že sama misel nanje pretežka. In med te teme za malodane celoten planet spada prav epidemija. To seveda ni še en zapis o epidemiji covid-19, ampak o tem, da bo nekatere dogodke, ki so se zgodili zlasti v prvem letu epidemije, vse težje raziskati, vse manj bo dokumentov, ki jih danes odgovorni še morajo hraniti, vse manj ljudi se bo verodostojno spominjalo dogodkov, vse težje bo iz tistega časa potegniti kakšno prihodnje znanje. Še najtežje pa bo tiste, ki so bili odgovorni za to, da sprejemajo odločitve, pripraviti do tega, da bodo javnosti pojasnili, kako so se sprejemale te (zdaj vemo, da napačne) odločitve.\n\nTi procesi potekajo v več državah, razlogi so različni. A tudi slovenska policija in tožilstvo morata prav glede obdobja epidemije opraviti svoje delo in raziskati, kako in zakaj so se sprejemale odločitve vlade Janeza Janše, ki so vodile k temu, da je Slovenija po smrtnosti zaradi covid-19 na devetem mestu med vsemi državami sveta in da je rekorderka po številu umrlih v domovih za starejše.\n\nČe povzamemo: Janševa vlada se je maja 2020 odločila, da starostnikom v domovih za starejše občane selektivno ne bo nudila pomoči in v skladu s temi navodili jih bolnišnice niso sprejemale, ampak so jih pustili umreti v domovih. Če se to bere preveč kruto, če zveni skrajno in neprimerno, naj raje citiramo kar zapis same Janševe vlade na Twitterju z dne 27. maja 2020, ki je namreč še mnogo bolj neposreden: »Moramo se soočiti z dejstvom, da med starostniki, zlasti med oskrbovanci DSO, živi veliko ljudi, ki se jim življenje počasi izteka. Pri njih premeščanje v bolnišnico, samo zato, ker so okuženi z novim koronavirusom, ni smiselno.« Nobenih kriterijev ni bilo, v nekem trenutku so bolnišnice pač prenehale sprejemati okužene iz domov za starejše – prav njihovo bivališče je bila edina diagnoza za nesprejem in opustitev zdravljenja. Zaposleni v domovih so bili popolnoma obupani, a v bolnišnicah so se navodil praviloma držali, včasih je kdo zaradi družinskih ali prijateljskih zvez vseeno prišel v bolnišnico, nekaterih so se včasih preprosto usmilili in jih mimo pravil vlade sprejeli. Kar seveda zadevo še oteži. Kako v bolnišnicah razlagajo to lastno selektivnost?\n\nDa bi se ubranili kakršnihkoli očitkov, da manipuliramo s podatki, naj citiramo kar izjavo Janševega direktorja NIJZ Milana Kreka, dano 11. januarja 2021: »Leta 2020 je v Sloveniji umrlo 2891 ljudi s kovidom. Od tega je umrlo 1682 ljudi v domovih starejših občanov in 1209 ljudi iz preostale populacije, ki ne sodi med oskrbovance domov.« To pomeni, da je bil leta 2020 delež starostnikov iz domov za starejše med vsemi mrtvimi kar 58-odstoten, še huje, leta 2020 je s covidom umrl vsak deseti stanovalec domov za starejše. Za primerjavo: v Italiji takšna preiskava poteka, ker je bil delež umrlih stanovalcev domov za starejše v tej državi 35-odstoten oziroma skoraj polovico nižji kot v Sloveniji. A Italije ne boste našli na seznamu prvih desetih držav po smrtnosti zaradi covida – je šele na 22. mestu. Slovenija je na devetem.\n\nZdaj, ko je znano, da je tudi v boju z epidemijo vse odločitve sprejemal takratni predsednik vlade Janez Janša, ostali pa so se mu podredili, danes pa te moči nima več, je torej čas, da se te nepotrebne, a dejanske smrti začnejo preiskovati – ne samo zaradi odgovornosti, ampak ker je treba vzpostaviti sistem odgovornosti in sistem ravnanja za prihodnje podobne dogodke, ki se zdijo v času popolne globalizacije in podnebnih sprememb še kar neizogibni. A najprej je treba opraviti preiskave, kako je sploh mogoče, da je do te odločitve prišlo (kdo je določil, da se nekaterim sme odvzeti pravica do zdravstvene oskrbe, kdo si je vzel pravico, da ljudem vzame njihovo pravico do oskrbe, in predvsem, zakaj so temu sledili ljudje, ki o tem odločajo samostojno, ker jim tako zapoveduje njihov poklic, torej zdravniki). Tri leta po sprejemu te res nesprejemljive odločitve je namreč še vedno vse zavito v meglo, nobenih odgovorov ni, predvsem pa ni raziskave. Oziroma če stvari postavimo drugače: če je v slovenskih domovih za starejše toliko ljudi več kot v sosednjih državah, pri čemer so si domovi v Italiji, Avstriji in Sloveniji zelo podobni, tudi tam nimajo vsi svoje sobe itd., je treba ugotoviti, koliko je k temu višjemu odstotku prispevala prav omenjena odločitev vlade – ker je namreč to edina odločitev, v kateri se Slovenija resno razlikuje od drugih držav. Tudi drugod so namreč imeli večje izbruhe prav v domovih za starejše. Pri čemer bi ravnanje vlade še lahko razumeli, če bi bile bolniške postelje dejansko zasedene (kot so trdili) in če dejansko ne bi imeli takrat na voljo medicinskega osebja (kot so trdili). Oboje je namreč že postavljeno na laž: prostih postelj je bilo tudi v najtežjih trenutkih po maju 2020 vedno dovolj, pa tudi medicinsko osebje je bilo na voljo, ni bilo pa vpoklicano (prav tako zaposleni v zasebnih ordinacijah).\n\nPreprosto si kot država ne moremo privoščiti, da ti dogodki ne bi bili preiskani. Če ne zaradi drugega, zaradi svojcev. Ti še vedno ne razumejo, zakaj njihovi najbližji niso bili deležni pomoči. Le zaradi napačnega naslova?\n\nDanes vemo, da je bila represija, ki jo je izvajala Janševa vlada v času epidemije, nedopustna, protiustavna in nezakonita. Vemo tudi, da represija ni dala želenih rezultatov – slovenski boj z epidemijo je bil namreč med najbolj neuspešnimi na svetu. Zdaj je treba preiskati še ostalo. \n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 0, "end": 49}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 85, "end": 167}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 169, "end": 308}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 310, "end": 386}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 388, "end": 448}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 1022, "end": 1168}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1156, "end": 1168}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1460, "end": 1479}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2270, "end": 2342}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 2346, "end": 2377}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2430, "end": 2498}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2543, "end": 2603}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 3081, "end": 3143}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3267, "end": 3346}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3437, "end": 3583}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3566, "end": 3583}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3766, "end": 3813}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 4159, "end": 4284}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 4327, "end": 4594}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 4597, "end": 4761}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4731, "end": 4761}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 4764, "end": 4907}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4964, "end": 5071}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 5074, "end": 5270}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5214, "end": 5270}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5449, "end": 5563}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5948, "end": 5957}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5959, "end": 5995}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5999, "end": 6104}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 6109, "end": 6228}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 6232, "end": 6580}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6384, "end": 6494}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6421, "end": 6432}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 6699, "end": 6845}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 7492, "end": 7514}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 7517, "end": 7556}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 7559, "end": 7611}], "article_id": "449", "lang": "sl", "text": "Muslimani, migranti, kulturni marksizem, diktatura, državljanska vojna in sobivanje\n\n\"Prihajajo muslimanski teroristi in begunci, ki si bodo pokorili krščansko Evropo.\" \"Na pohodu je kulturni marksizem, katerega cilj je ponovna vzpostavitev komunistične diktature, kar pomeni, da nas bodo spet metali v jame.\" \"Radikalni desničarji pozivajo k oboroževanju, preti nam državljanska vojna.\" Po deželi se plazijo strahovi, spodbujani s te ali one strani. Z ene bolj, z druge manj. Načini političnega boja so pač različni.\n\nV teh časih, ko se vse bolj zapiramo v mehurčke in se naelektreno ozračje v družbi kaže v jezi in izključevanju ter celo v odkriti sovražnosti, so osebna srečanja tista, kjer spoznamo, da so ljudje mnogo boljši, kot se nam morda zdijo, če jih spremljamo le na družbenih omrežjih ali prek medijev. Pogovor o vrednotah, ki so nam kljub vsem razlikam skupne, čeprav jih razlagamo in živimo v različnih duhovnih in filozofskih kontekstih, so lahko primerno seme za boljšo skupnost.\n\nSpodbujen s spominom na Forum za dialog med vero in kulturo, ki ga je pred leti organiziral katoliški duhovnik Milan Knep in je na srečanja vabil različne, a misleče ljudi, sem na domačijo v Dobu pri Domžalah povabil nekaj nosilcev različnih pogledov na dogajanje v družbi. Ni se zbrala skupina ljudi, prišli so posamezniki, ki znajo slišati drugačne od sebe in poskušati razumeti, zakaj se njihova stališča razlikujejo. In predvsem nimajo do njih odklonilnega, zaničevalnega odnosa.\n\nV teh dneh so v Dobu potekale slovesnosti ob 800-letnici prve omembe kraja in naj bo to srečanje dodatni kamenček k temu dogajanju, kamenček, usmerjen v prihodnost. Lepo je bilo za isto mizo ob krušni peči v 200 let stari slovenski kmečki hiši videti predstavnike islamske, pravoslavne in katoliške skupnosti, dva bivša politika, filozofe in v veliko čast nam je bilo, da nas je prišla pozdravit tudi predsednica države.\n\nSrečanje je bilo neformalno, brez pripravljenih referatov, edino pravilo je bilo, da naenkrat govori le ena oseba. Tok razmišljanja sem poskušal moderirati sam, kar pa niti ni bilo nujno potrebno. Naše druženje se je zavleklo tja proti polnoči.\n\nImam Muslimanskega kulturnega centra Ljubljana Nevres Mustafić se je moral najprej soočiti s provokativnim vprašanjem, ali bodo muslimani v prihodnjih letih z mečem in ognjem prišli nad Evropo. \"Bistvo vere je upanje za človeka. Pri tem absolutno ne pride v poštev uporaba sile. Tako sveta knjiga Koran kot Mohamed s svojim življenjem pričata o tem,\" se je odzval imam.\n\n\"Povsem drugo pa je, ko islam izkoriščajo nekateri, ki jih ne vodijo verski vzgibi. Muslimani, kristjani in judje imamo monoteistično etiko, kjer ne vidim dosti razlik. Te so na teološki ravni. Pogovarjati se je treba o tem, kaj so skupne vrednote, tako med vernimi kot neverujočimi,\" je dodal Mustafić.\n\nKatoliški duhovnik Branko Cestnik je menil, da smo vsi na tržnici idej. V tem smislu tudi staranje prebivalstva v Evropi – povprečna starost slovenskega duhovnika, pa tudi kmeta, je dobrih 60 let – Cestnik vidi kot priložnost in ne kot pokop krščanstva. Podobno na to kot na novo priložnost gleda tudi papež Frančišek, je izpostavil.\n\nStarešina Pravoslavne cerkve v Ljubljani protojerej Borislav Livopoljac je ob tem poudaril, da je treba \"svojega Boga znati videti tudi v svojem bratu\". \"To je bistvo našega življenja,\" je poudaril.\n\nSkupno so zaključili, da so se na žalost pojavljale osebe oziroma gibanja, ki so različne vere izkoristile v namene, ki z dejanskim naukom nimajo nikakršne povezave. V imenu tega ali onega boga za lastne sprevržene koristi.\n\nDuhovnik Milan Knep je medtem izpričal svojo osebno izkušnjo, kako ima v veri zavetje, kamor se z molitvijo, branjem in pripravo na mašo zateče pred vsakodnevno medijsko ponudbo, ki je velikokrat, kot pravi, predvsem propaganda.\n\nIn tako je pogovor prisotnih preskočil na medije kot usmerjevalce našega dojemanja sedanjosti. Filozof, pesnik in prevajalec Gorazd Kocijančič je izpostavil izjemen prepad med sprejemanjem in predelovanjem informacij. Kot je poudaril, \"propagande, ki smo ji izpostavljeni, miselno ne predelujemo\".\n\n\"Nekoč smo poznali različne oblike askeze. Danes bi lahko bila ta askeza odvrnitev od medijev – osvoboditi se vezi medijev, ki so neke vrste žile tehnološke civilizacije,\" je menil Kocijančič.\n\nOb tem je omenil kolega filozofa in pisatelja Pavleta Raka (ki je bil sicer prav tako povabljen na srečanje, a je trenutno v samostanu na grškem polotoku Atos), ki je opazil, da neki menih bere tri leta star časopis. Na vprašanje, zakaj to počne, mu je ta odvrnil: \"Saj je vedno isto.\"\n\nNekdaj eden najvplivnejših politikov v državi Gregor Golobič meni, da so mediji, ki so bili nekoč protagonisti razsvetljene rabe uma, v veliki meri zgubili ta status. Poleg prevlade logike kapitala jih hendikepirajo tudi družbena omrežja, ki potencirajo stanje postresnice, kjer je vse res in hkrati nič ne drži.\n\n\"Stopnja prevaranosti in samoprevaranosti je visoka, zamaskirana v to, da si je nekdo sam ustvaril neko mnenje, da se je domnevno sam dokopal do neke informacije. Kakor je seveda smiselno, da bi po zgledu Finske npr. skozi šolski sistem pridobili veščine presoje informacij, pa ostaja odprto vprašanje, ali si ljudje povečini sploh želijo biti nedezinformirani. Na volitvah tako pogosto, in ne le pri nas, zmagujejo popolnoma neuresničljivi programi, pri čemer se te fiktivnosti zavedajo tako politiki kot volivci,\" je opozoril Golobič.\n\nČe je bilo še pred desetletji videti, da bo internet pripomogel k iskanju resnice, je sedaj jasno, da jo zamegljuje. Širina ponudbe omogoča prosto jemanje z menija glede na vsakršni okus.\n\nNa srečanje sem povabil še nekaj prijateljev in uglednih osebnosti. Čeprav jim ni uspelo priti, pa so mi vseeno poslali nekaj misli. \n\nFilozofinja in sociologinja dr. Renata Salecl se je lepo navezala na razmišljanje Golobiča. \"Danes je odnos med resnico in lažjo veliko bolj zapleten, kot je bil nekoč. Mnoge oblastnike danes sploh ne zanima, kaj je resnica. Tisti, ki jih vleče v smer avtoritarizma, pa največ profitirajo od tega, da ljudje ničemur več ne verjamejo.\"\n\nGeograf in pedagog ter predvsem okoljevarstvenik dr. Dušan Plut je opozoril, da se končno začenjamo bati tudi samih sebe. \"Človeška vrsta je pravzaprav neverjetno brezskrbno, s paradigmo stalne rasti populacije in potrošnje, že krepko stopila v geološko obdobje antropocena. Postala je namreč največja in hkrati muhasta sila, ki izčrpava in degradira planetarni ekosistem, naš edini dom ... Tako se strahovom pred Drugimi pritajeno pridružuje še strah – pred samim seboj.\"\n\nFizik, sociolog in profesor na ljubljanski teološki fakulteti dr. Igor Bahovec pa se je zavzel predvsem za dialog. \"Če v Sloveniji kaj manjka oziroma če je kaj, kar bi bilo dobro poživiti, je pristni dialog oziroma kultura srečanja, dialoško iskanje odgovorov ipd.\"\n\nV tem smislu je podprl naše srečanje in vsako tovrstno pobudo, \"ki se napoti po poti iskrenega iskanja\". \"Mislim, da je potencial takšnih srečanj v tem smislu velik,\" mi je sporočil in napovedal, da se nam naslednjič pridruži.

Nekaj prijetnega. Sanje, za katere je morda bolje, da jih ne razlagam ženi. A me medtem zbudi neprijeten občutek. Nekoliko me zebe. Poskušam zaspati, da bi se sanje nadaljevale. Kolikor se spomnim, se sicer nikoli ne nadaljujejo. Ne gre. Naj grem po dodatno odejo? Za to je treba vstati. Res zoprno.\n\n... ampak ne tako zoprno\n\nNaj s poltople postelje stopim do idiličnih jaslic in posredno v kraje, kjer je Jezus hodil pred dva tisoč leti. Mnoge zebe. In nimajo odeje, da bi se pokrili. S tem, da to, da jih zebe, niti ni največja težava. \n\nV trenutku, ko je pred mano težka naloga vstati in vzeti dodatno odejo, nekje drugje nekdo vkleščen pod ruševinami s šibkim glasom kliče na pomoč. Njegova roka je našla pot izpod betona in poskuša s krpanjem narediti pot za izhod. Le roka. So njegovi otroci, žena, starši zasuti in mrtvi?\n\nVečina prebivalcev Gaze nima več domov. Do Netanjahujevega končnega cilja: od 42 odstotkov ozemlja, kolikor so ga Palestincem leta 1947 določili Združeni narodi, do nič odstotkov. Popolno očiščenje. Mrtvi in pohabljeni otroci so kolateralna škoda. Krog je sklenjen – Netanjahu v ogledalu vidi Hitlerja.\n\n7. oktobra je Hamas storil zločin. Kaj pa vsi oktobri po tem datumu in leta pred tem? Kdo ima vse manj ozemlja in vse več pobitih, je jasno. Je to borba za iztrebljenje Hamasa, da vržeš tisoče granat na Gazo, jim ukineš vodo, hrano, elektriko, gorivo? Vseeno jim je, ali jih pobijejo ali bodo umrli zaradi okužb, lakote. Genocid. Dosledno. Brez milosti. S pod stavbami izmaličenimi ženskami, otroki brez nog, rok, oslepelimi ...\n\nZločin in kazen\n\nVseeno jim je! Del jih bodo pobili, del pregnali. Usmerjajo jih v smrt in razčlovečenje: \"Pojdite iz severne Gaze v južno Gazo. Tam bo varno.\" Nato raketirajo južno Gazo. \"Pojdite v mesto Rafa na jugu Gaze. Tam bo varno.\" In raketirajo. \"Pojdite v begunsko taborišče, tam bo varno.\" Raketirajo. Ta Hamas je pa res povsod, kajne?\n\nZa Evropo to pomeni tisoče novih beguncev in vzpodbujanje frustracij, jeze, brezupa … Pogoji za nabor novih teroristov. Ko se bo nekdo razstrelil sredi množice in božičnega vzdušja nekje v Evropi ali ZDA, bomo tudi zgolj \"pokazali na 7. oktober\" in zamahnili z roko: \"Dobili smo, kar smo iskali. Povračilni ukrepi, pač.\"\n\nTo, da se je v času po 7. oktobru podpora Palestincev Hamasu povečala, izraža le njihov obup, nemoč in jezo, kar se bo v prihodnje odrazilo še kje. Mladenič, ki ni mogel izpod ruševin izkopati stisnjenega dekleta, ki se je stegovalo k življenju, bo nekje našel krivca. Tako kot je Hamas težava za Palestince, je Netanjahu problem za Izraelce. Zaradi obeh bo ogromno žrtev na obeh straneh. Na palestinski zdaj, na izraelski v prihodnje. Vsako dejanje ima svoje posledice.          \n\nKdo je gospodar vojne?\n\nIn kdo bo ustavil to, kot se je izrazil Boštjan Videmšek, popolno razčlovečenje pred našimi široko zaprtimi očmi, ko se v popolnem opustošenju trga družbeno tkivo? Nemočni Združeni narodi? Ali je kdo naredil dovolj, da se to ustavi? Nihče. Večina te možnosti nima.\n\nPogled tistih, ki bi lahko, se žal ne sklada z njihovo agendo. Američani in Britanci? Njihova vojaška letala z bombami dnevno oskrbujejo Izraelce. Trgovci so težko za ukinitev donosnega posla. ZDA s pomočjo Izraela geostrateško obvladujejo na nafti ležeči Bližnji vzhod.\n\nIn kdo obvladuje precejšen del največjih bank in finančnih tokov? Judi ali Palestinci? In pomembne medije? Kdo finančno in medijsko gradi kandidate za ameriški kongres in senat, ki morajo biti po tem, ko to postanejo, uslužni svojim sponzorjem? Težko bi rekli, da Palestinci.\n\n\"Vesel Božič\"\n\nKaj poganja ta planet? Dobrota? Ne, pohlep. Želja po več. \n\nO nujnost imeti \"več\", nas dnevno prepričujejo oglasna sporočila. Še posebej v prednovoletnem času, ko se med nas priplazi blaznost potrošniške ideologije v vsej svoji veličini. Za čaščenje zlatega teleta, prodati več, si je prisvojila tudi božič. \"Kaj boste jedli, kaj boste kupili?\" je odmevalo iz medijev v adventnem času.\n\nNekatere moti, da jim trgovci ne voščijo za božič. Verni, ki nam je božič čas božjega učlovečenja, ne potrebujemo voščila trgovcev. Jezus je trgovce nagnal iz templja. Se pa ob tem sprašujemo, zakaj Bog ne ustavi trpljenja. Ne bo ga, človeku je namreč dal svobodno voljo. Dal nam je svobodo, da se sami odločamo, in za osnovo imamo deset božjih zapovedi.\n\nRes v božjem imenu?\n\nZelo priročen ni Bog le za pospeševanje prodaje, temveč tudi doseganje političnih ciljev. Mnogi s prstom kažejo na vero, češ, zaradi vere se ljudje pobijajo. Ne, vera le služi za izgovor. Služi tistim, ki imajo koristi v pobijanju in umiranju.\n\nTe dni je po spletu zaokrožilo zelo slikovito iskanje vzgibov za vojne: so Rusi in Ukrajinci v vojni zaradi vere? Ne, oboji so pravoslavci. Kaj pa Izrael? Oni so Judje. In Palestinci? Muslimani, suniti. Kdo podpira Palestince? Iran. So oni muslimani? So, ampak šiiti, ki se ponavadi ne razumejo s suniti. Aha.\n\nZa koga so pa Albanci? Za Jude. Ampak Albanci so muslimani. So, ampak imajo radi Ameriko, ta pa je z Izraelci. Dobro, potem so Srbi iz Bosne gotovo proti Izraelu. Ne, oni so za Izrael. No, če so muslimani iz Albanije za Izrael, potem so gotovo tudi muslimani iz Bosne za Izrael. Ne, oni so za Palestino. Kaj pa bosanski Hrvati? Oni so tam v federaciji z muslimani. Torej so za Palestino? Ne, ne, Hrvati iz Bosne so za Izrael. Srbi so sigurno za Palestino, ki ni priznala Kosova, in proti Izraelu, ki ga je priznal? Jok, Srbi so za Izrael. In Ukrajinci? Za Izrael. Potem so Srbi zagotovo za Ukrajino, če so za Izrael? Ne, za Rusijo so. Hm, zapleteno.\n\nNaj poskušam vseeno kaj zadeti … Hrvati? Za Izrael. Torej so tudi za Rusijo? Ne, za Ukrajino. A so potem Rusi za Izrael? Ne, Rusi so za Palestino, ki jo podpira Iran, ta pa je ruski zaveznik. Ok, potem morajo biti muslimani iz Bosne sigurno za Rusijo, ker iranski muslimani držijo z Rusi, ki je za Palestino, in Ukrajina je za Izrael. Saj je tako? Jok, muslimani iz Bosne so za Ukrajino in proti Rusiji, ker so Srbi iz Bosne za Rusijo …\n\nZdaj mi ni nič več jasno … Kaj je pa s Turki? Turki so muslimani, torej so za Palestino? Tako, tako … Oni so predvsem proti Kurdom. Kaj je zdaj s Kurdi? Kurdi so večinoma ateisti. Torej so zagotovo s Kitajci. Ne, Kurdi so z Američani. Torej so Turki proti Američanom, če so Američani s Kurdi? Ah, kje pa … Turki so v Natu, ameriški zavezniki. Kaj pa Sirci, oni so muslimani? So torej s Turki? Ne, streljajo se s Turki. Če so Turki proti Kurdom, so torej Sirci s Kurdi? Ne, tudi z njimi se streljajo. So torej Sirci za Izrael? Daj, no, Sirija je s Palestino stoodstotno …\n\nPohlep rojeva smrt\n\nŽelja po imeti več in biti na oblasti žene voditelje do skrajnosti. Če je treba, tudi v vojno. Zanje je zunanji sovražnik bistven, kajti le ob tem, skupnem sovražniku, se ljudstvo oklene oblastnikov in jim podaljša sedenje v predsedniških prostorih.\n\n\"Več\" je beseda, s katero oglaševalci prodajajo, kar ljudje potrebujejo ali ne. \"Več\" je beseda, ki utira pot pohlepu, in pohlep je razlog za gorje in osrednji uničevalec tega planeta.\n\nZačne se že pri želji imeti več všečkov. Najprej bi jih imeli deset, potem je uspeh sto, a le vedno višje številke nas začasno potešijo. Žal želja po več ne ostaja le pri všečkih. Pohlep nas žene h kopičenju, želji po obvladovanju. Za \"več\" so najvplivnejši odločevalci pripravljeni gaziti do kolen v tuji krvi. Res je, ko je krvi že čez kolena, jim je nekoliko neugodno. Pa še to zaradi njihove volilne baze in ne trpečih. In neugodno jim ni nič bolj kot takrat, ko je treba vstati za dodatno odejo.\n\nListje je odpadlo, drevo je golo. Letos drugače kot doslej?

Če je na dan žena lahko prisluhnila svoji kolegici, predsednici republike Nataši Pirc Musar, ki je svoj poprejšnji nefeminizem nadgradila z obratom in premierno pojasnila javnosti, da je feministka, menda celo po svoji DNK strukturi, je Urška Klakočar Zupančič na isti dan izbrala drugačno možnost in ugotavljala, da ji feminizem res ne leži. Še huje, raje ga je še enkrat grobo problematizirala.\n\nNaj spomnim: obe političarki sta bili celo nominirani za Bodečo nežo, ker sta v preteklem letu izrazili svoj odločen »ne« feminizmu. Drži, da nobena od njiju ni izrekla eksplicitno seksistične izjave, je pa obema spodletelo pri začetni razlagi, kaj je s feminizmom narobe, s čimer sta razkrili globoko nerazumevanje vprašanj, povezanih s položajem žensk. Na letošnji 8. marec, kar res ni nesimbolično, se je njuna skupna pot razcepila: ena se je v feminizmu zapoznelo prepoznala, druga ga odločno zavrača.\nFeminizem ne spoštuje obeh spolov enako\n\nPredsednica parlamenta, za katero se je na začetku zdelo, da je s svojimi rdečimi čevlji in tudi brez njih promotorka žensk v politiki, zaradi česar ji je feminizem blizu, je lani decembra odkrivala svojo ekvidistanco do spolov: »Ne, ne bi se označila kot feministka, zato ker v bistvu spoštujem oba spola enako, zavzemam se za vsakogar, kateremu so kršene, lahko rečeva, človekove pravice ali kakšne druge pravice, kakšne druge svoboščine. Za vsakogar, ne glede na to, ali je ženska, ali moški; mlad ali starejši; ali veruje, ali ne veruje, ne glede na to kakšne narodnosti je in etnične pripadnosti, spolne usmerjenosti in tako naprej.«\n\nSpol.si in kolektiv Rdeče zore, ki podeljujeta kislo nagrado, sta utemeljila njeno nominacijo z razlago, da feminizem ni obrat od šovinizma v drugo smer, ampak ima za cilj njegovo izkoreninjenje. Razen tega, so še dodali, zajame feminizem širše polje od problematike spola in z njim povezane enakosti, zaradi česar je njena izjava res deplasirana.\n\nNamesto da bi predsednica parlamenta sprejela kritiko na svoj račun in se izobrazila, je ob vprašanju o tem reagirala maksimalno kontrastno glede na predsednico parlamenta. Če je slednja presenetljivo ugotavljala, da je feminizem vtkan v njen DNK, je na isti dan sama svojo nominacijo v studiu pri Urošu Slaku na POP TV komentirala takole: »Jaz sem to doživela tako. Šovinizem in seksizem napadata tvoje telo. Ta feminizem, ki pa je po mojem prestopil svojo mejo nekega sprejemljivega, spravnega feminizma in je šel v nek absurd, pa napada človeško, oziroma žensko dušo. Tako da ne vem, kaj je feministke tako zmotilo. Ampak tako pač je. Jaz sem se že navadila.«\n\nPravi in nepravi\n\nRazlika ne bi mogla biti večja. Predsednica republike je vmes odkrila svoje feministično bistvo, njena kolegica v parlamentu pa ravno nasprotno – svojega sovražnika. Zdi se celo, da gre za grobo kritiko podeljevalk Bodeče neže. Kako je sploh izpeljala svojo »analizo« napada na dušo?\n\nUrška Klakočar Zupančič je preprosto uvedla dihotomijo, ki si jo je sama izmislila in jo vpeljala: imamo spravni feminizem, kar je termin, ki ga še nismo slišali in ne vemo, kaj ta predstavlja, in na drugi strani absurdno napadalni feminizem, načenjajoč nič manj kot žensko dušo. Najbrž tudi njeno. Argumentacijska prevara je s tem jasno nakazana: razcepimo feminizem na »pravi« in »nepravi«, nato bičajmo »nepravega«, pri tem pa arbitrarno popačimo njegovo naravo in osnovno definicijo.\n\nZanjo je feminizem tistih, ki so ji podelili nagrado, očitno »nepravi«. Ampak kam nas pripelje tovrstna argumentacijska prevara? Če obstajata njegovi dve vrsti, »pravi« in »nepravi«, bi pričakovali, da bo kakšno dobro besedo za prvega našla tudi sama. Toda ne, ona ni feministka! Torej ni feministka niti po »pravem« feminizmu. S tem se zaplete v nasprotje v dihotomiji, ki jo je sama umetno ustvarila: zakaj človek ne bi bil na strani nečesa, kar je pravo? Kaj jo še naprej sili v potrditev, da ni feministka? Nekako se zdi, da je razcep, ki ga je vpeljala, zgolj slab izgovor.\n\nAnaliza DNK\n\nPredsednica parlamenta si je privoščila še brutalnejši korak. Ne le, da zavrača feminizem, primerjala ga je s šovinizmom in mačizmom, ki napadeta telo. Ker pa je duša nekaj plemenitejša od njega, je napad feminizma na dušo tolikanj nevarnejši. Povedano drugače: feminizem je zanjo hujši od šovinizma in seksizma! Zdaj vemo, kaj raje izbrati.\n\nČeprav bi pričakovali, da bo na dan žena poskušala najti kakšno toplo besedo v smeri enakopravnosti spolov, je v napačnem feminizmu, ki ga je sama skonstruirala, raje prepoznala največjega nasprotnika žensk. Le zakaj bi se na ta dan sploh pogovarjali o seksizmu in mačizmu, če imamo pred sabo resnejšega sovražnika! Zanimivo bi bilo slišati, ali lahko »pravi« in »nepravi« feminizem detektiramo že z analizo DNK – če je ta slučajno že vtkan vanjo. Kot je pri predsednici republike.

Na današnjem srečanju Varnostnega sveta ZN-a o Gazi je vodja humanitarne službe ZN-a Martin Griffiths poudaril pomen agencije. \"Če povem zelo preprosto in naravnost: naš humanitarni odziv na okupirano palestinsko ozemlje je odvisen, popolnoma odvisen od tega, ali je UNRWA ustrezno financirana in operativna,\" je Griffiths povedal 15-članskemu svetu. \"Aktivnosti reševanja življenj agencije ... več kot trem četrtinam prebivalcev Gaze ne bi smele biti ogrožene zaradi domnevnih dejanj nekaj posameznikov. Gre za izjemno nesorazmerje,\" je dejal.\n\nVeleposlanica ZDA pri ZN Linda Thomas-Greenfield je na zasedanju dejala, da je Washington odločitev o začasni prekinitvi financiranja sprejel neodvisno od drugih donatorjev.\n\n\"Naj bom jasna, to ni bil kaznovalni ukrep. Je pa poziv k prebujanju.

Palestinci izraelsko stran obtožujejo ponarejanja informacij, da bi očrnili delovanje agencije.\n\nV agenciji je zaposlenih okoli 13.000 ljudi, ki vodijo šole, klinike, institucije osnovnega zdravstva in druge socialne službe ter razdeljujejo humanitarno pomoč. \"Humanitarni sistem v Gazi propada,\" je še dejal Guterres. \"Izjemno sem zaskrbljen zaradi nečloveških razmer, s katerimi se sooča 2,2 milijona prebivalcev Gaze, saj se borijo za preživetje brez vseh osnov.\"\n\nUNRWA: Delavce smo odpustili preventivno, preiskava še poteka\n\nPredtem je tiskovna predstavnica UNRWA Tamara Alrifai dejala, da je agencija devet od 12 zaposlenih, ki jih je Izrael obtožil sodelovanja v napadu 7. oktobra, odpustila, a da je bil ukrep \"preventiven\", saj preiskava še poteka.\n\nČe bo preiskava pokazala, da so nedolžni, imajo pravico do vrnitve službe, je opozorila. Poudarila je, da Izrael pozna identiteto vseh 13.000 članov osebja UNRWA ter da je postopek za zaposlitev strog, vsakega človeka tudi varnostno preverijo.\n\nUNRWA vsako leto z Izraelom deli celovit seznam svojih delavcev v Gazi, na Zahodnem bregu in v Vzhodnem Jeruzalemu, je dodala Tamara Alrifai, ki je pojasnila, da od Izraela niso prejeli nikakršnih pripomb.\n\nPredstavniki več agencij ZN-a so objavili izjavo s svarilom glede financiranja UNRWA. Več držav je namreč prekinilo financiranje agencije, potem ko je Tel Aviv 12 njenim zaposlenim očital sodelovanje v napadu na Izrael 7. oktobra. To bi lahko imelo katastrofalne posledice za prebivalce Gaze in povzročilo popoln propad tamkajšnjega sistema zagotavljanja humanitarne pomoči, so opozorili.\nTisoči otrok so ostali brez enega ali obeh staršev\n\nMed žrtvami v Gazi, skupno jih je že več kot 27.000, je več kot 11.500 mlajših od 18 let, več tisoč otrok je postalo sirot. Kot navaja BBC, nedavno poročilo evromediteranskega monitorja za človekove pravice razkriva, da je brez enega ali obeh staršev ostalo več kot 24.000 otrok, podatki Unicefa pa kažejo, da je osirotelih oz. da je brez odrasle osebe, ki bi lahko pazila nanje, okoli 19.000 otrok. \"Številne med njimi smo našli pod ruševinami ali pa so izgubili starše v bombardiranju njihovega doma,\" je za BBC dejal vodja komuniciranja za Unicef Palestina Jonathan Crickx in dodal, da so druge našli na izraelskih nadzornih točkah, v bolnišnicah in na ulicah. \"Najmlajši pogosto ne morejo niti izgovoriti svojega imena, tudi starejši so običajno v takem šoku, da jih je težko identificirati in jih potencialno združiti z razširjeno družino.\"\n\nNetanjahu napoveduje boj do \"izpolnitve vseh ciljev\"\n\nIzraelski premier Benjamin Netanjahu je zavrnil poročila o dogovoru o prekinitvi napadov na Gazo in obljubil boj do \"izpolnitve vseh ciljev\". Netanjahu je pod vse večjim pritiskom družin zajetih talcev in širše izraelske javnosti, naj doseže dogovor s Hamasom. \"Ne bomo umaknili izraelske vojske iz Gaze in ne bomo izpustili na tisoče teroristov,\" je dejal.\n\nDogovor naj bi namreč v zameno za izpustitev talcev, zajetih 7. oktobra, vključeval tudi začasno prekinitev napadov, omogočanje dobave humanitarne pomoči in izpustitev neznanega števila palestinskih zapornikov v izraelskih zaporih.\n\nVodja Hamasa Ismail Hanija je medtem dejal, da preučujejo zadnji predlog za premirje, a da je njihova prednostna naloga \"popoln umik\" izraelskih sil iz Gaze in dolgoročno premirje.\n\nHanija naj bi danes ali v četrtek obiskal Kairo, kjer bo opravil pogovore o predlogu, ki so jim ga posredovali po nedeljskem srečanju predstavnikov ZDA, Izraela, Katarja in Egipta v Parizu.\nBolnišnica Al Amal ne obratuje več\n\nMedtem je izraelska vojska vdrla na območje bolnišnice Al Amal v Han Junisu na jugu okupirane Gaze. V bolnišnici ima sedež tudi palestinski Rdeči polmesec. Na območju bolnišnice je še ločena stavba, v kateri je zavetišče pred izraelskim bombardiranjem našlo več sto Palestincev. Izraelske sile so na območje vdrle ob močnem streljanju in tankovskem obstreljevanju, pri čemer je bilo ranjenih najmanj 10 ljudi, poroča Al Džazira. Nekateri ranjeni, ki so krvaveli, so v bolnišnici umrli, saj jih niso mogli prepeljati v Naserjevo bolnišnico ali druge delujoče ustanove.\n\nZaradi izraelskega obleganja Al Amal ne obratuje več, saj je bolnišnici zmanjkalo zdravstvenih potrebščin za kakršne koli posege. Prav tako nimajo goriva, ne deluje niti en električni generator.\n\nPalestinski Rdeči polmesec je sporočil, da je izraelska vojska ubila varnostnika v bolnišnici, medtem ko je stal ob stranskem vhodu. Človekoljubna organizacija je poročala tudi o dimnih bombah v bližini bolnišnice.\n\nIzraelske sile so napadle tudi bolnišnico Al Avda na severu Gaze, je dejal tamkajšnji zdravnik Mohamed Sala. Ta bolnišnica je že drugič tarča napadov v zadnjih dveh dneh.\n\nNadaljevanje bombardiranja juga Gaze\n\nJužni del Gaze je bil ponoči in zjutraj tarča nenehnih zračnih napadov in obstreljevanja izraelskih sil, poroča francoska tiskovna agencija AFP. Tarča je predvsem mesto Han Junis, v katerem je kombinacija stalnega bombardiranja in dežja številna območja spremenila v opustošeno polje blata in ruševin.\n\nPo navedbah prič je bil tarča obstreljevanja tudi Naserjev bolnišnični kompleks v Han Junisu, kamor se je po navedbah Urada ZN-a za koordinacijo humanitarnih zadev (Ocha) zateklo na tisoče razseljenih ljudi.\n\nIzraelska vojska je medtem sporočila, da so njeni pripadniki na severu Gaze ubili 15 domnevnih teroristov in v raciji v eni od tamkajšnjih šol zajeli še deset pripadnikov palestinskega gibanja Islamski džihad.\nV šoli odkritih najmanj 30 trupel\n\nAl Džazira poroča, da so na šolskem dvorišču na severu Gaze odkrili najmanj 30 trupel. Očividec, ki je odkril trupla, je dejal, da so jih našli med čiščenjem ruševin na dvorišču. Ugotovili so, da so pod kupi zakopana trupla. Ta so bila že razpadla, oči so imela prevezane, noge in roke pa zvezane.\n\nMinistrstvo za zdravje v Gazi je sporočilo, da je bilo v zadnjih 24 urah ubitih 150 Palestincev, 313 pa je bilo ranjenih.\n\nOd začetka napadov 7. oktobra so izraelske sile v Gazi ubile že 26.900 ljudi, od tega večinoma žensk in otrok, okoli 66.000 pa je ranjenih.\n\nBolnišnica Ibn Sina: Do zdaj še ni bilo atentatov v bolnišnicah\n\nMedtem odmeva torkova akcija izraelskih posebnih sil, ki so – preoblečene v zdravnike, druge zdravstvene delavce in civiliste – v bolnišnici Ibn Sina v Dženinu na okupiranem Zahodnem bregu usmrtile tri palestinske borce, ki so se tam zdravili.\n\nTiskovni predstavnik bolnišnice Tavfik Al Šobaki je dejal, da ni bilo nikakršnega streljanja oziroma izmenjave ognja, potem ko so izraelske sile vdrle v bolnišnico in ubile tri bolnike.\n\n\"Kar se je zgodilo, je precedens. Nikoli še ni bilo atentata v bolnišnici. Bile so aretacije in napadi, a nikoli atentata,\" je dejal.\nVarnostni svet o začasnih ukrepih ICJ-ja\n\nV sredo bo na temo začasnih ukrepov, ki jih je Meddržavno sodišče (ICJ) pred nekaj dnevi sprejelo glede dejanj Izraela v Gazi, zasedal Varnostni svet ZN-a.\n\nRavno pred zasedanjem je Izrael potrdil, da je v podzemne tunele v Gazi spustil \"večje količine morske vode\", kar je bil eden od primerov, ki jih je Južna Afrika navedla v svoji tožbi o genocidu zoper Izrael.\n\nTo bi namreč lahko povzročilo \"dolgoročno onesnaženje vodonosnikov in prsti\" ter \"dodatno degradacijo in propad vodne in kanalizacijske infrastrukture v Gazi\".\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Doubt", "start": 533, "end": 719}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 569, "end": 589}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 986, "end": 990}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1007, "end": 1078}, {"tag": "Red_Herring", "start": 1081, "end": 1274}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1554, "end": 1617}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1572, "end": 1578}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1730, "end": 1753}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1982, "end": 1993}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2090, "end": 2123}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2675, "end": 2729}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 3230, "end": 3295}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3338, "end": 3372}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 3375, "end": 3573}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3868, "end": 3982}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3960, "end": 3967}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3985, "end": 4034}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4047, "end": 4308}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4913, "end": 4966}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5013, "end": 5024}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5027, "end": 5110}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5927, "end": 5968}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5937, "end": 5968}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6005, "end": 6179}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 6413, "end": 6432}], "article_id": "4493", "lang": "sl", "text": "Golobov zeleni prehod k Putinu za Jankovića\n\nS pozivom naj Zoran Janković ustavi gradnjo kanalizacijskega voda čez vir pitne vode v glavnem mestu, je ta teden iz ZDA presenetila predsednica Nataša Pirc Musar. V ozadju pa je vlada zavrnila evropske načrte za zmanjševanje uvoza ruskega plina, ker namerava vlada za “zeleni prehod” župana glavnega mesta Jankovića uvoz plina močno povečati. Na ruski plin se premier Robert Golob spozna. Ob elektriki iz edine nuklearke je ruski plin v preteklosti preprodajal kot šef državnega GEN-I.\n\nZadnje tedne pa se precej sramoti z nenavadnimi izmikanji odgovorom na vprašanja, zakaj je velike vsote denarja od tam nakazoval Martinu Berishaju na Kosovo, Vesni Vuković v SEEM M. & C …\n\nPirc Musarjeva iz ZDA kot premierka kritizira Jankovića\n\nPirc Musarjeva je ob vodi kritizirala Jankovića, da ekološko tvegan projekt izvaja brez dogovorov in strokovnih presoj možnih posledic. Veliko presenečenje pa je bila njena kritika, ker vemo, da je Janković stric sedanje vlade. Golob je bil v preteklosti podpredsednik Jankovićeve Pozitivne Slovenije. Janković pa je z Milanom Kučanom z javno podporo lani močno prispeval, da je kot “novi obraz” z Gibanjem svoboda na volitvah poslancev dosegel tretji najvišji delež v zgodovini volitev poslancev. Višjega sta le še Janez Drnovšek z LDS leta 2010 in SMC z Mirom Cerarjem leta 2014.\n\nDodatno nenavadno je bilo, ker se je Pirc Musarjeva iz ZDA oglasila kot predsednica vlade in ne kot le predsednica republike, ki ima le simbolno oblast in se v dnevne posle vladanja ne vtika. Da slabo dela, je udarila po ministru za naravne vire in prostor Urošu Brežanu.\n\nTo je eno od petih nedavno na novo ustanovljenih ministrstev, s katerimi smo dobili po številu eno najbolj obilnih vlad v Evropi. Za nenavadnost, da se je Pirc Musarjeva oglasila kot šefica vlade, je bil nekoliko kriv premier Golob sam. V ZDA je na konferenco OZN o vodi v delegacijo, ki jo je vodila Pirc Musarjeva, poslal kar dva ministra svoje obilne vlade. Ob Brežanu še zunanjo ministrico in šefico SD Tanjo Fajon. Najbrž z logiko, da Pirc Musarjeva sama, ker je še nova, ne bi zmogla. Fajonova se zadnje tedne trudi še, da ne bi propadla v boju z Belorusijo za sedež nestalne članice varnostnega sveta OZN. Brežan se je iz ZDA pred Pirc Musarjevo oglasil s sporočilom, da ima Janković za gradnjo kanalizacijskega voda čez vir pitne vode vsa dovoljenja, koristi projekta pa so večje od potencialnih nevarnosti. A Pirc Musarjeve to ni ustavilo, da od Jankovića ne bi zahtevala ustavitve gradnje, povrhu pa ministra Brežana pozvala, naj takoj pripravi spremembo zakonodaje, ki ni dovolj jasna in dovoljuje “nekatere obvode”.\n\nRecimo, da nihče ne opravi resne presoje možnih posledic na okolje.\n\nPozneje se je Pirc Musarjeva nekoliko dopolnila, da ni zahtevala ustavitev del, le krajšo prekinitev za pogovor. Kar je takoj sprožilo razprave, kdo vse je poklical Pirc Musarjevo. So jo le odposlanci Jankovića, ki ima težave tudi s kmeti, ki jim prekopava zemljo, ti pa so zadnje dni protestirali celo s traktorji. Ali pa je poklical sam Kučan, kot je namignil predsednik opozicijske SDS Janez Janša, ki nenavadni Jankovićevi gradnji že dolga leta nasprotuje:\n\nRuski plin za vlado zeleni prehod\n\nDa vlada eno govori, zaradi Jankovića pa dela nekaj povsem drugega, je dodatno pokazala odločitev ta teden, ki jo je večina medijev spregledala. Vlada se je odločila, da bo zavrnila dopolnitev evropske uredbe za zmanjšanje uvoza plina iz Rusije za petnajst odstotkov, ker bo Janković Ljubljano začel ogrevati na plin in bomo uvoz močno povečali. Janković je nekoč neuspešno poskušal olastniniti Mercator, pozneje pa so ga v času vlade Alenke Bratušek iz njegove stranke s prodajo propadajočemu hrvaškemu Agrokorju prevzele ruske banke po pol nižji ceni kot bi jo dobili za isti posel v času vlade Boruta Pahorja nekaj leti prej. Janković je že po ruski okupaciji Krima odšel v Moskvo prevzet odlikovanje, s katerim ga je nagradil diktator Vladimir Putin. Nagrade ni vrnil niti po napadu Rusije na Ukrajino. Jankovića najdemo tudi ob vseh množičnih obiskih iz Moskve v Slovenije zadnja leta, celo na večerji šefov pravosodja obeh držav se je pojavil in na zadnjem obisku Marjana Šarca, ki je kot zadnji šef slovenske vlade potoval v Moskvo tik pred tem, ko je vrgel puško v koruzo.\n\n“V enoti TE-TOL, ki jo upravlja Energetika Ljubljana, d. o. o., bo namreč predvidoma letos začela delovati plinsko parna enota, ki bo nadomestila premog. Gre za dolgoročnejšo investicijo, ki je bila v fazi realizacije že pred začetkom vojne v Ukrajini. To bo predvidoma vodilo do povečanja povpraševanja po plinu v Sloveniji za približno 15-20 %. Slovenija tako pričakuje, da bo v končnem besedilu predloga to dejstvo z ustrezno izjemo upoštevano, saj meni, da države članice za ukrepe zelenega prehoda ne bi smele biti kaznovane. V nasprotnem primeru Slovenija predloga uredbe Sveta ne bo podprla.”\n\nKo medije ureja stranka, ki je proti Natu in za Putina\n\nGolobu volivci na referendumu niso zavrnili obilne vlade, zamižali so tudi, ko je Golobova oblast odločila, da se s skrbjo za starejše ne mudi in je prestavila dodatne ukrepe, ki jih je na področju dolgotrajne oskrbe starejših uzakonila prejšnja vlada. Zdaj prihajajo posledice tega. Država izgublja evropski denar, ki ji je bil za to področje že dodeljen:\n\nNa referendumu je bil še zakon, s katerim vladajoče stranke poskušajo takoj odstaviti celoten vrh RTV Slovenija, da bi Svoboda, SD in Levica lahko še tam nastavile svoje direktorje in urednike. Projekt je obstal na ustavnem sodišču.\n\nPomembna podrobnost je, da je ministrstvo za kulturo, ki je pristojno za področje medijev, številni največji mediji pa so v državni lasti in močno državno financirani, premier Golob prepustil stranki Levica, ki je za izstop iz Nata in proti vojaški pomoči Ukrajini, češ da to, če se Ukrajina upira agresiji, ovira “mir”. Namesto besede “mir” bi lahko uporabili tudi “Putinove kolonialne in ozemeljske načrte”.\n\nZnano je, da sta Putin in Moskva po Evropi in svetu močno podpirala skrajno leve in desne politike, stranke in medije in dobre odnose je zanesljivo krepil tudi denar, ki je tekel in še teče na prikrite načine.\n\nLe kaj bi Golobu pri zelenem prehodu z dodatno porabo plina, ki praviloma pride iz Rusije, skrbjo za vodo z Jankovićevo kanalizacijo čez vodne vire in ob medijih Levice, ki je proti zahodnemu zavezništvu demokratičnih držav Nato, lahko še šlo narobe?\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 166, "end": 213}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 166, "end": 213}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 216, "end": 315}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 377, "end": 450}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 453, "end": 531}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 602, "end": 678}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 756, "end": 795}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 799, "end": 889}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 879, "end": 889}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1235, "end": 1326}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1550, "end": 1618}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1622, "end": 1722}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1875, "end": 1979}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1931, "end": 1979}], "article_id": "4494", "lang": "sl", "text": "Pet žensk toži zvezno državo Teksas zaradi zakona proti splavu\n\nNa državnem sodišču v Austinu je pet žensk, ki trdijo, da niso mogle prekiniti nosečnosti kljub temu, da je bilo ogroženo njihovo zdravje in življenje, vložilo tožbo proti zvezni državi Teksas zaradi strogega in nejasnega zakona proti pravici do splava.\n\nV tožbi, ki so jo vložile v ponedeljek, ženske trdijo, da teksaški zakon, ki je eden najstrožjih v ZDA, povzroča zmedo med zdravniki.

Prekinitev nosečnosti je dovoljena le, če je ogroženo življenje nosečnice, zdravnike pa je strah kazenskega pregona.\n\nNe bi smeli dopustiti, da mora nekdo čakati na zdravstveno oskrbo, dokler ni na pragu smrti, je opozorila Nancy Northup, izvršna direktorica Centra za reproduktivne pravice, ki zagotavlja pravno zastopanje žensk. Odkar je vrhovno sodišče ZDA razveljavilo prelomno odločitev iz leta 1973, ki je Američankam zagotovila pravico do splava, so se v zveznih državah ZDA sprožili številni podobni pravni izzivi.\n\nV teksaški tožbi je navedeno, da so eni od tožnic, Amandi Zurawski, omogočili splav šele, ko je prišlo do zastrupitve krvi. Druge štiri so morale odpotovati iz države, da so dobile ustrezno zdravniško oskrbo zaradi zapletov, povezanih z nosečnostjo. Zdravniki so sicer priporočili splav zaradi poslabšanja njihovega zdravstvenega stanja, vendar postopka umetne prekinitve nosečnosti v Teksasu nihče ni upal izvesti. \"Moj zdravnik ni mogel posredovati, dokler je utripalo srce zarodka ali dokler nisem bila dovolj bolna,\" je v torek na novinarski konferenci dejala Zurawskijeva.\n\nTiskovni predstavnik teksaškega pravosodnega ministra Kena Paxtona je v torek sporočil, da je minister zavezan storiti vse, kar je v njegovi moči, da bi zaščitil matere, družine in nerojene otroke.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 24, "end": 106}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 145, "end": 167}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 197, "end": 244}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 729, "end": 875}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 878, "end": 938}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1600, "end": 1655}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1795, "end": 1857}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1951, "end": 2023}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2074, "end": 2094}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2163, "end": 2216}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2219, "end": 2368}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2537, "end": 2552}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2619, "end": 2651}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2878, "end": 2960}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2963, "end": 3060}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3063, "end": 3162}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3166, "end": 3313}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3301, "end": 3306}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3338, "end": 3399}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 3401, "end": 3480}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 3451, "end": 3455}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 3497, "end": 3517}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 3497, "end": 3517}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 3529, "end": 3562}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3529, "end": 3544}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 3549, "end": 3562}], "article_id": "4495", "lang": "sl", "text": "Ukrajina: Kaj pa zdaj?\n\nVojaško stanje v Ukrajini veliko bolj škoduje gospodarskim motorjem EU kot pa Rusom.\n\nPočasi se izteka drugo leto ruske »posebne vojaške akcije« v Ukrajini. Vojaške razmere po ne preveč uspešni ukrajinski poletni ofenzivi so se nekako ustalile približno na zgornjih mejah štirih ukrajinskih pokrajin Hersona, Zaporožja, Donecka in Luganska. Te štiri pokrajine so skupaj s Krimom pod rusko oblastjo, s približno nekaj več kot desetimi milijoni prebivalcev, z več kot polovičnim deležem rusko govorečega prebivalstva: najmanj v Hersonu, ena četrtina, največ pa v Lugansku in Donecku, po tri četrtine. Ruska federacija si je te province prisvojila, na zahodu pa jih imamo za ukrajinske pod rusko okupacijo.\n\nV začetnem obdobju ruske vojaške intervencije je bil najbrž cilj zrušiti ukrajinsko vlado in vzpostaviti Ruski federaciji naklonjen politični režim. Ker to ni uspelo, je ruska vojska spremenila taktiko in cilje. Postopoma je vzpostavila nadzor nad zgoraj navedenimi pokrajinami. Letos pa je poslala svojega vojaškega stratega, da je s polaganjem min vzpostavil skoraj nepremakljivo frontno linijo, razen na mejah Luganska (tudi Harkov), kjer se frontna meja premika sem in tja okoli nekaj ukrajinskih mest (generala so potem umaknili v Moskvo!). Vojaška taktika se je popolnoma spremenila: ni več toliko tankovskih spopadov, droni pa so čedalje večja žrtev obrambe, na obeh straneh. Obe vojski z granatami neusmiljeno obstreljujeta območja frontne linije in zato obe iščeta nove in nove dobavitelje granat. Ukrajinski vojski je v zadnjem času uspelo prekoračiti Dneper.\n\nSe pa v zakulisju dogaja marsikaj, kar je zavito, skrito, na primer spori med politiko in vojsko v Kijevu in neenotna podpora v nekaj državah EU, čeprav večina članic še vedno stoji ob Ukrajini. Še vedno se ne iščejo izhodi za mirno rešitev vojaških spopadov.\n\nTreba je pogledati še ekonomsko stanje nekaterih držav zaradi vojaških spopadov v Evropi. Posledice so vidne, realnih, točnih podatkov s potrebnimi analizami pa ni. Stanje ekonomije je videti »čudno«. Nemčiji kot industrijski velesili so se vhodni energetski stroški povečali za okoli deset odstotkov, zato se je zelo zmanjšala njena konkurenčna sposobnost. Izgubila je velikega kupca, Rusijo (tudi industrijske opreme), ki ga ni mogla nadomestiti, finančna in vojaška pomoč Ukrajini sta načeli njene rezerve. Vsi so pričakovali, da bo Ruska federacija utrpela velik padec ekonomske moči, kar se je v prvi fazi tudi pokazalo. Zdaj pa že nekaj časa opazujemo preobrat: Nemčija razvojno navzdol, Rusi pa kljub ogromnim vojaškim izdatkom rahlo navzgor. Nemčija ni nadomestila izgubljenih kupcev, Rusiji pa je to uspelo, predvsem zato, ker je preusmerila energetski izvoz (tudi drugo, surovine) v azijske države, največ na Kitajsko. Ta je dobila ekonomski sunek, da se je ustavilo padanje družbenega proizvoda.\n\nSkratka, vojaško stanje v Ukrajini veliko bolj škoduje gospodarskim motorjem EU kot pa Rusom. Zavest o takšnem položaju še vedno ni tolikšna, da bi politiki EU začeli iskati miroljubne rešitve. Najbrž še vedno niso ugotovili, da imajo največjo korist od takšne evropske politike ZDA in Kitajska.\n\nPravo sliko napačne politike je pokazala predsednica evropske komisije, ki je takoj podprla ZDA in Izrael, ne pa takojšnje zaustavitve morije v Gazi. Zaradi tega in zaradi podcenjevanja posledic vojaških spopadov v Ukrajini in Izraelu bi se pa morali ona in njeni politični privrženci takoj in v temeljih spremeniti.\n\nKaj pa zdaj? Ukrajina mora zmagati. Ali res? Zmagati mora mir in zmagala bo EU!\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Doubt", "start": 385, "end": 450}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 467, "end": 553}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 467, "end": 486}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 566, "end": 711}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 795, "end": 848}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1202, "end": 1356}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1359, "end": 1548}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1889, "end": 1922}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 1995, "end": 2090}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 2160, "end": 2313}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2496, "end": 2715}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2584, "end": 2636}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 3053, "end": 3120}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 3388, "end": 3741}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3946, "end": 4094}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4207, "end": 4236}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4221, "end": 4236}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4529, "end": 4538}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4563, "end": 4647}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4614, "end": 4622}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4685, "end": 4706}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4712, "end": 4729}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4733, "end": 4843}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5154, "end": 5177}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5304, "end": 5321}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5555, "end": 5576}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5625, "end": 5642}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 6521, "end": 6689}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6727, "end": 6737}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6862, "end": 6872}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 6885, "end": 6933}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6908, "end": 6933}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6936, "end": 7072}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 7037, "end": 7072}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 7075, "end": 7086}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 7164, "end": 7185}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 7217, "end": 7334}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 7410, "end": 7420}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 7436, "end": 7489}], "article_id": "4496", "lang": "sl", "text": "Demokracija v času koronakrize v Sloveniji\n\nŽe več kot mesec dni potekajo protivladni protesti v različnih mestih po Sloveniji. Zaradi tega je tudi preklic epidemije in bližajočih se prvih 100 dni vlade pravi trenutek, da naredimo refleksijo protestniškega gibanja in stanja demokracije v Sloveniji.\n\nProtesti, ki so se začeli po razkritju spornih nabav medicinske in zaščitne opreme, so veliko bolj heterogeni in polni vsebine, kot pa poročajo mediji. Vendar tisto, kar močno bode v oči, je antipolitičnost protestov, pri čemer gre za veliko protislovje. Protesti, ki imajo za cilj zamenjavo vlade in politične oblasti v državi, se samodeklarirajo ne le kot nepolitični, temveč velikokrat tudi kot antipolitični. Šlo naj bi za protest civilne družbe, različnih gibanj in nevladnih organizacij, ki pa se po novem večinoma deklarirajo kot nepolitični. Celo politične stranke, ki sodelujejo na protestih, poudarjajo, da gre za nepolitične procese in proteste.\n\nČeprav je (ne)deklarirani cilj zamenjava politične oblasti, se v ospredje postavljajo teme, kot so več pravne države, svoboda medijev, strpnost, politična korektnost, zaščita narave, poštenost ipd. To naj bi bili tudi sinonimi za demokracijo. Vprašanje sodelovanja ljudstva v politični oblasti, ki je izraz moči ljudstva, ni na dnevnem redu, socialna in ekonomska vprašanja so potisnjena na obrobje. Sindikatov ni opaziti na protestih, v trenutni krizi pa so se zavezali nekakšnim pravnim formalizmom in se vse bolj nagibajo k najnižji korporativni zavesti, ki nadomešča politično delovanje. Iz protestov umanjka vprašanje naraščanja neenakosti in številnih odpuščanj, umanjka problem Gorenja, ki bo po vsej verjetnosti v slabih dveh letih zmanjšalo število zaposlenih za okrog 35 odstotkov, umanjka problem odpuščanja agencijskih delavcev v Revozu ipd. \n\nZakaj je ta zadeva tako problematična? Gre za paradoks, ki je značilen za neoliberalno kapitalistično družbo in državo. Situacija, v kateri se protesti, ki imajo za cilj spremembo politične oblasti, (samo)deklarirajo kot nepolitični, je izraz depolitizacije politike in družbe. Politika naj bi bila nekaj slabega, vsi politiki naj bi bili isti. Po drugi strani pa se je s popolnim umikom strank iz protestov, oziroma prepuščanju le-teh nepolitični civilni družbi, depolitiziralo tudi družbo kot tako. V ospredju se jasno kažejo predvsem liberalna in kulturna vprašanja, ki prevladujejo nad razrednimi in socialnimi problemi ter konflikti, ki so inherentni kapitalističnim družbam. Namesto vprašanja odpuščanj in reševanja velikih podjetij ter pričakovanja pomoči sedaj zasebnim bankam - oziroma triumf socializma za bogate - so v ospredju vprašanja svobode, morale, prava, kulture, svobode medijev ipd. Gre za zahteve, ki so vezane na liberalizem, moralo in pravo, ne pa za demokratično politiko. \n\nZaradi tega so ti protesti, če izvzamemo izjemno pomemben ekološki moment in emancipacijski naboj, ki ga prinaša v politiko, izraz dvojega: prvič, prevlade liberalnega uma nad demokratičnim; drugič, prevlade kulturnega boja nad razrednim. Oboje pa lahko pripišemo depolitizaciji družbe in tudi same politike. Namreč od Aristotela in njegove teze, da je človek v prvi vrsti politična žival (zoon politikon), smo prišli do stanja, v kateri se zdi, da je človek vse drugo, samo politično bitje ne. Človek naj bi bil predvsem zasebnik in podjetnik – pripadnik meščanske družbe. Ob tem pa je Aristotel zelo jasno izrazil socialno in razredno naravo demokracije, kar nam olajša razumevanje skepse in strahu vladajočih razredov pred demokracijo. Za Aristotela demokracija ne pomeni toliko vladavino večine, temveč predvsem vladavino revnih. Kot pravi Aristotel, gre prej za naključje, da je bogatih povsod malo, revnih pa povsod veliko. Vendar to ni ključni kriterij, po katerem se demokracija razlikuje od oligarhije. Osnovni kriterij za razlikovanje med demokracijo in oligarhijo ni številčnost, temveč vprašanje lastnine in bogastva. \n\nZgornja problematika izginjanja demokracije, ki je razvidna tudi na protestih v Sloveniji, sovpada s podobnimi procesi v Evropi v zadnjih desetletjih. V tem okvirju se vse bolj potrjuje, da se v Sloveniji, tako kot tudi v celotni EU, uveljavljata dva koncepta, ki pa sta oba antidemokratična. Prvi je zavezan liberalizmu, demokracije kot moči ljudstva pa ni nikjer in posledično sam koncept demokracije popolnoma umanjka. V ospredju so predvsem svoboda, lastnina, pravna država, svoboda medijev, enakost in enakopravnost vseh manjšin itd. V kolikor pa ljudstvo na volitvah ne izbere liberalcev, takoj letijo obtožbe, da je ljudstvo zavedeno, da gre na drugi strani za populiste, če ne že za kaj hujšega. Drugi koncept lahko opredelimo kot iliberalno demokracijo ali avtoritarno oblast, ki ohranja pravnoformalne postopke liberalne demokracije, pri čemer so liberalne komponente vse bolj zanemarjene. Tisto, kar oba koncepta zgrešita, je vprašanje razredov in neenakomerno razdeljene lastnine. Prvi koncept poskuša prek poudarjanja pomena pravic - predvsem svobode in svetosti zasebne lastnine - izriniti socialna in ekonomska vprašanja iz politike ter jih prepustiti tehnokratom; v drugem pa so za vse krivi tujci, begunci, migranti, drugi. V obeh primerih je emancipacijska politika neobstoječa, saj oba koncepta temeljita na utrjevanju kapitalizma in moči zasebnega kapitala. \n\nDemokracija, ki deluje po volji trga in kapitala\n\nV tem okvirju tretja Janševa vlada samo zaostruje procese, ki potekajo v Sloveniji že dobro desetletje: kulturni boj namesto razrednega in nekaj, čemur bi potencialno lahko rekli iliberalna demokracija. Kot alternativa temu pa se ponuja izpraznjena liberalna politika, ki temelji na izrivanju ljudstva iz političnega odločanja. Oba procesa sta usmerjena k oblikovanju tega, kar je Angela Merkel pred leti poimenovala \"Marktkonforme\" Demokratie – gre za demokracijo, ki deluje po volji trgov in kapitala. To pa je politično depolitizirana demokracija, v kateri ne obstaja demos. Dejstvo, da na protestih v veliki meri umanjka politizacija socialnih in ekonomskih problemov, ni slučajnost in je skladno s tem, da se nikjer ne izraža potreba po več demokracije – razen v obliki sodelovanja nevladnih organizaciji pri kapitalskih in državnih projektih. To je vse, kar je še ostalo od »demokracije« in na to je pristala tudi leva politika. \n\nProtesti prinašajo možnost, da se v okvirih nove ekonomske krize, v kateri lahko znova pride do zaostrovanj razrednih protislovij ter do še večje koncentracije kapitala, naslovi demokratična politika. Le-ta, izhajajoč iz Aristotela, temelji na emancipacijskem potencialu samovladanja in moči ljudstva ter je usmerjena v gradnjo alternativ obstoječem političnoekonomskem sistemu. Vendar pa je treba izpostaviti, da demokracija, ki je izpraznjena vsebina in v ospredju katere so izključno liberalna vprašanja, kot so svoboda, mediji, kultura ipd., ni demokracija, ampak je, kot pravi Yasha Mounk, nedemokratični liberalizem. Antipolitičnost večine slovenskega protestniškega gibanja ni izraz demokratične družbe, temveč odraz depolitizirane neoliberalne politike. Antijanšizem ni ne politika ne demokratična politika, še manj pa je to čakanje na novega liberalnega odrešenika pred vsakokratnimi volitvami. V tem kontekstu se zdi, da ima le ekološko gibanje potencial, da postane avantgarda demokratizacije slovenske politike, saj izkoriščanje narave povezuje s socialnimi in ekonomskimi protislovji kapitalizma ter naslavlja nujnost širše preobrazbe politike, ekonomije in družbe.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 30, "end": 205}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 165, "end": 186}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 239, "end": 257}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 269, "end": 360}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 363, "end": 461}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 374, "end": 392}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 437, "end": 461}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 500, "end": 518}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 554, "end": 573}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 596, "end": 618}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 648, "end": 656}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 721, "end": 738}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 741, "end": 1017}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 741, "end": 838}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 759, "end": 784}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 842, "end": 909}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 977, "end": 998}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1121, "end": 1134}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1137, "end": 1203}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 1205, "end": 1262}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1264, "end": 1393}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1395, "end": 1484}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1477, "end": 1483}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1514, "end": 1610}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 1568, "end": 1607}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1612, "end": 1735}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1766, "end": 1796}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1823, "end": 1839}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1850, "end": 1894}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1897, "end": 2101}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 2105, "end": 2144}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2115, "end": 2120}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2147, "end": 2293}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2295, "end": 2436}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2364, "end": 2379}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2439, "end": 2586}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2456, "end": 2479}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2619, "end": 2633}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2672, "end": 2714}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2689, "end": 2714}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2704, "end": 2714}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2821, "end": 2882}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2910, "end": 2975}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2920, "end": 2932}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2970, "end": 2975}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 3335, "end": 3551}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3640, "end": 3645}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3745, "end": 3870}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4050, "end": 4136}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4122, "end": 4128}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4850, "end": 4923}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4850, "end": 4858}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5050, "end": 5066}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 5069, "end": 5221}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5329, "end": 5346}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5359, "end": 5413}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 5600, "end": 5933}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5603, "end": 5632}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 6042, "end": 6141}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6085, "end": 6113}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6144, "end": 6324}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 6327, "end": 6508}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6327, "end": 6508}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6398, "end": 6408}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 6511, "end": 6683}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6511, "end": 6582}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6523, "end": 6582}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6585, "end": 6683}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 6686, "end": 6760}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6714, "end": 6730}], "article_id": "4497", "lang": "sl", "text": "Migracije – medijski fenomen\n\nEnaki posnetki, enake izjave, ista terminologija in isti sogovorniki, kot bi bili leta 2015 … Da bi bila repeticija popolna, so na RTV iz naftalina potegnili celo Mira Cerarja!\n\nMigranti so spet v medijih.

In ali niste opazili, da ste popolnoma enake prispevke pripravljali pred covidom, ko je bilo število migrantov za tretjino manjše? Kako točno ste se vsi skupaj odločili, da je ravno zdaj, septembra 2023, položaj »krizen«? Kaj sploh ta beseda pomeni? Resnega odgovora dejansko ni ponudil nihče. »Saj veš, o tem zdaj vsi poročajo, pa moramo še mi …« Novinarji bodisi nimajo dovolj znanja, da bi lahko racionalno obravnavali migracije, ali pa nimajo dovolj časa in avtonomije. Skupaj z nami so prepuščeni brezglavemu pozornostnemu ciklu, ki nas premetava iz ene moralne histerije v drugo, ne da bi obravnavane novice dejansko razumeli. Do novinarja pride usmeritev uredništva in že leti na teren po izjave ter poskuša pri tem delovati karseda pronicljivo ali kritično … Brez konteksta, brez analize, brez kakršnegakoli uvida v položaj onkraj: »Glejte to sranje – kaj bo vlada nardila?« Ko novinar poroča o prezeblih ljudeh v prenatrpanih taboriščih, jezno sprašuje državne sekretarje: »Zakaj ne storite več, da bi pomagali beguncem?« Ko zbira izjave zaskrbljenih lokalcev na meji, pa sekretarje v enaki pravičniški drži sprašuje: »Zakaj ne storite več, da bi odgnali begunce?«\n\nTega usklajenega medijskega bombardiranja s spektakularno predstavljenimi novicami o migrantih seveda ne moremo jemati kot »obveščanje prebivalstva«. Nasprotno, dejanski učinek je dezinformiranje in ustvarjanje vsesplošnega občutka, da je Slovenija »preplavljena s pribežniki«. Tako je mogoče, da v regiji, ki je stotine kilometrov od kakšne migrantske poti, srečaš upokojenko, ki »si ne upa več sama v hosto po gobe, odkar je toliko migrantov«! Zgodilo se nam je to, da so mediji smešno majhno število prehodov meje spremenili v »krizo«. Šestintrideset tisoč prosilcev za azil, kolikor jih je v osmih mesecih prečkalo državo (velika večina jih je namreč odšla iz nje še isti dan), pomeni približno 150 ljudi na dan. Za primerjavo je v istem obdobju to pot opravilo skoraj tri milijone turistov, da ne govorimo o več milijonih tranzitnih potnikov in sto tisoče dnevnih migrantov znotraj države … Edini razlog, da je v vsej tej gneči sploh mogoče zaznati obstoj peščice beguncev, je pomanjkanje prostora v azilnih domovih, kar prinaša občasno večjo koncentracijo tujcev na enem mestu in temu primerno slabe razmere. Povedano drugače: zgolj nekaj sto primerno razporejenih prenočišč bi zadostovalo, da »kriza« izgine. Žrtev tega pomanjkanja postelj pa kakopak niso zaskrbljeni domačini, ampak begunci sami.\n\nTežko bi rekli, da so pomanjkljive azilne zmogljivosti kakšna posebna novica, saj gre za stalnico slovenskega azilnega sistema. Razlog, da je danes to postalo očitneje, pa se ne skriva toliko v povečanem številu migrantov kot v spremenjeni mejni politiki Slovenije in EU. Ker so v letih pred covidom naši mejni organi sistematično zavračali prosilce za azil že na mejah in jih nasilno vračali prek Hrvaške v BiH, so se prosilci ustrezno prilagodili in se izogibali državnim organom; azilni domovi so bili temu primerno bolj prazni, migrantov pa na papirju manj, ker večine niso evidentirali. Ljudje so namreč prestrašeno hiteli skozi Slovenijo prek zelene meje, se lačni in žejni skrivali v gozdovih, umirali v rekah in gorah. Ta vrsta razpršenih migracij je tudi prinašala več incidentov – če si ljudje ne morejo legalno kupiti hrane v trgovini, se peljati z javnim prevozom ali prenočiti pod streho, morajo vse to pač storiti ilegalno. Tako je bilo leta 2019 pod ministrom Poklukarjem kljub na videz manjšemu številu migrantov stanje bolj kaotično. Danes se ta politika na mejah ne izvaja več – namesto nasilnega vračanja, ki migracije razprši po državi in spodbuja tihotapstvo, se ljudem dovoli urejeno vstopiti na enem območju in tam zaprositi za azil ter se registrirati v azilnem domu. Rezultati so izjemno pozitivni: policijska statistika kaže, da poteka vstop bistveno bolj urejeno, ni več smrti v gozdovih, ni kriminala ali incidentov z domačini, ni posla za tihotapce. Edina nepremišljena posledica te nove politike je prenatrpan azilni dom. Zato bi bilo primernejše kot o »migracijski krizi« govoriti o logistični nesposobnosti ministrstva za notranje zadeve.\n\nSprememba mejne politike, ki je kljub nekoliko večjemu številu prehodov naredila migracije bistveno bolj varne in urejene, za prosilce in za domačine, pa ima tudi ekonomski kontekst. Po velikih gospodarskih pretresih koronskega obdobja se gospodarstva celotne EU spoprijemajo s pomanjkanjem delovne sile, saj jim je ne uspe dobiti dovolj. Večjo prepustnost zunanjih meja in hitrejši dostop prosilcev za azil do trga dela moramo zato nujno razumeti tudi kot reševanje nemškega, avstrijskega in francoskega gospodarstva. Tu pa se skriva še odgovor na naše izvorno vprašanje: zakaj so medijske hiše ta pojav opazile šele danes? Jasno, ker bo z ohlajanjem gospodarstva in sušenjem investicijskih tokov nujno prišlo zapiranje meja. Tega se nedvomno zavedata tudi Robert Golob in njegov minister Poklukar, ki že mesece zagovarja zaostritve tujske zakonodaje, ohranitev panelne ograje na meji in povečevanje nadzora. Ko bodo prišli prvi signali iz Nemčije, Avstrije ali Italije, da imajo kapitalisti tam dovolj delavcev, bo stari mehanizem izgonov, skupaj z nasiljem, kaosom in smrtmi, znova zaživel. Naši mediji s trenutno histerizacijo pridno pripravljajo politični teren, da bo Poklukar lahko prelomil koalicijske zaveze in te prakse brez težav spravil skozi državni zbor. Morda pa ti medijski cikli »migrantskih kriz« le niso zgolj stvar naključja.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 74, "end": 108}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 294, "end": 308}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 343, "end": 362}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 365, "end": 420}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 484, "end": 505}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 605, "end": 615}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 771, "end": 777}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 771, "end": 784}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 871, "end": 1167}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 925, "end": 930}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 959, "end": 966}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 983, "end": 997}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1171, "end": 1371}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1252, "end": 1257}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1515, "end": 1633}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1561, "end": 1585}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1793, "end": 1835}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1820, "end": 1835}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1838, "end": 2155}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1855, "end": 1875}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2158, "end": 2223}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2225, "end": 2502}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2356, "end": 2366}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2392, "end": 2399}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2417, "end": 2424}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2486, "end": 2502}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2506, "end": 2563}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2524, "end": 2530}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2559, "end": 2563}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2566, "end": 2948}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2566, "end": 2948}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2950, "end": 3429}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3051, "end": 3057}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3151, "end": 3163}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3289, "end": 3334}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3404, "end": 3429}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3433, "end": 3638}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3559, "end": 3565}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3641, "end": 3783}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3764, "end": 3783}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3844, "end": 3922}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3914, "end": 3922}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3925, "end": 3956}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3943, "end": 3948}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3961, "end": 4079}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4061, "end": 4079}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4082, "end": 4144}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4303, "end": 4316}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 4349, "end": 4379}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4381, "end": 4473}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4476, "end": 4913}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4476, "end": 4635}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4766, "end": 4789}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5055, "end": 5145}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5072, "end": 5077}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5112, "end": 5118}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5148, "end": 5184}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5187, "end": 5466}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5365, "end": 5382}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5444, "end": 5449}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5469, "end": 5580}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 5469, "end": 5790}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5527, "end": 5534}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 5688, "end": 5709}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5794, "end": 5901}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 5903, "end": 5962}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5924, "end": 5945}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 6056, "end": 6185}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6122, "end": 6131}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 6186, "end": 6461}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 6217, "end": 6233}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6336, "end": 6354}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6464, "end": 6518}], "article_id": "4498", "lang": "sl", "text": "Evropske vrednote\n\nKot je bilo pričakovati, zanimanje za vojno v Ukrajini plahni z vsakim novim poletnim dnem. Novice s fronte vztrajno drsijo s prvih časopisnih strani, modro-rumena kombinacija izginja s profilnih slik, število komentarjev pod vojnimi novicami je desetkrat manjše kot pozimi. Pompozne besede o boju za evropske vrednote zdaj izzvenevajo v prazno. Zdi se, da je javnost že dosegla svoj prag občutljivosti in nobena količina podrtih stavb, junaških zgodb z bojišč ali žalostnih otroških oči ne more več doseči viralnosti prvih tednov. Javljanje vojakov v Evrovizijo je bil morda še zadnji propagandni uspeh, potem pa je vse to postalo del standardiziranega repertoarja z Unicefovih koledarjev. Ukrajina je zdaj Afganistan, Jemen, Sudan, Sirija ... Še ena zjebana država, v katero se stekajo orožarske investicije, ne da bi ponujala kako čustveno katarzo. In vse kaže, da so politiki na obeh straneh konflikta povsem zadovoljni z nadaljevanjem uničenja. Bidnova ekipa z zadovoljstvom opazuje nove poslovne priložnosti, ki si jih je ustvarila z vojno, Putin šteje dodatne milijarde od prodaje energentov in spreminja vojno stanje v politični kapital doma.\n\nEdini, ki se še pretvarjajo, da ima vojna kak ideološki ali duhovni pomen onkraj golega tekmovanja za nadzor resursov, so evropski voditelji – torej tisti, ki poleg Ukrajincev z vojno največ izgubljajo. Medtem ko vodje posameznih držav (med njimi tudi Robert Golob) ob pogledu na neobvladljivo rast cen že ubirajo precej bolj pragmatične tone, Ursula von der Leyen še vedno proizvaja svoje generične antiavtoritarne slogane za vsakega, ki je pripravljen poslušati. »Ukrajina je na frontni črti in brani evropske vrednote!« S temi besedami je na junijskem vrhu EU Ukrajino uvrstila na seznam kandidatk za članstvo v Uniji. Sporočilo ne bi moglo biti bolj deplasirano. Ne le, da gre za prazno simbolno gesto brez kakršnekoli koristi za ukrajinsko prebivalstvo (celo von der Leynova priznava, da je to predvsem psihološka podpora), ampak gre tudi za gesto, ki jo prebivalci BiH, Srbije, Makedonije in Albanije lahko razumejo le kot norčevanje iz njihovih lastnih prizadevanj za vstop v EU. Le v čem je Ukrajina bolj demokratična in manj koruptivna od njih? Evropski voditelji se ne znajo več niti pretvarjati – vsi vemo, da je ponujena kandidatura EU le še simbolno orodje v diplomatskem izigravanju ene države proti drugi, korenček, ki ga gospodar hinavsko pomoli pred oslom, kadar ga hoče pognati še malo dlje proti nevarnemu prepadu.\n\nPrav zato zvenijo pridige o evropskih vrednotah tako votlo. Kje so bile te evropske vrednote zadnjih 30 let, ko je postala Ukrajina najrevnejša država evropskega prostora in najbolj zaostala bivša sovjetska republika? Kje so bile milijardne subvencije, ko je Ukrajina po razpadu SZ izgubila polovico svojega BDP? In kje so bili zaskrbljeni zagovorniki človekovih pravic, ko so jo v vseh življenjskih kazalcih prehitevale države tretjega sveta? Jasno, tako Evropi kot ZDA je ustrezalo, da Ukrajini vladata revščina in korupcija, da njene resurse plenijo oligarhi, da revno prebivalstvo množično odhaja na Zahod, kjer opravlja težka fizična dela, menja plenice zahodnim otrokom in ustvarja dobičke spolni industriji. Ukrajino so videli točno tako, kot danes vidijo BiH ali Srbijo: kot črpališče poceni resursov in dela, kot vrtiček, ki ga obdelujejo različne frakcije lokalne oligarhije, razpete med ruskimi in zahodnimi botri.\n\nEvropski komisiji se je šele leta 2014, ravno med pogajanji Janukoviča in Putina o vstopu v evrazijsko gospodarsko koalicijo, čudežno utrnila ideja, da bi Ukrajino uvrstili na seznam kandidatk za vstop v EU. Prebivalcem razen te simbolne geste seveda niso ponudili ničesar, so pa pomagali razplamteti majdansko vstajo in oborožili ukrajinske skrajneže. In nič drugače ni bilo letos s pogovori o vstopu v Nato – ponudba ni bila nikoli kaj drugega kot ameriška poteza na diplomatski šahovnici, ki ji je Ukrajina neumno sledila. \n\nIdeja, da si zahodne sile prizadevajo za širitev demokracije in »evropskih vrednot«, bi morala biti že zdavnaj pokopana. Smo že vsi pozabili na njihovo ravnanje z Rusijo po razpadu SZ? Takrat so obstajali vsi pogoji za gospodarsko in institucionalno integracijo Rusije v evropsko območje, a le kdo je v neoliberalnih 90. razmišljal o takšnih velikopoteznih investicijah? Mantra je bila: »Privatiziraj, odpuščaj, pleni!« Zahodni gospodarski interesi so bili tisti, ki so omogočili razpad države in vzpon oligarhije. Zahod je oligarhom omogočil iz države spraviti ukradene milijarde, jih poskriti v davčne oaze ter si ustvariti prijetno domovanje v Londonu, Luksemburgu, Monaku. Zahod je podprl Jelcina, ko je ta s tanki napadel parlament. Predvsem pa je Zahod brez najmanjših težav opazoval, kako z uvedbo gospodarske šok terapije 150 milijonov ljudi izgublja svoje premoženje, kako družba razpada, ulice pa se polnijo z lačnimi in premraženimi množicami. Rusija je izgubila kar 40 odstotkov svojega BDP, smrtnost med moškimi srednjih let je porastla za 50 odstotkov, žensk pa kar 80 odstotkov. ZDA in Evropa so složno sodelovale pri tem, da so Rusijo pahnile nazaj desetletja v razvoju. Kje so bile takrat evropske vrednote?\n\nKot smo prejšnji teden videli v odnosu evropskih vladarjev do BiH, Srbije in Makedonije, je investiranje v razvoj evropske periferije zadnja stvar, ki bi jih zanimala. Ne bi jih moglo manj brigati za gospodarsko zaostalost periferije, dokler jim ta prinaša poceni surovine in delo. Zahodne kapitaliste zanima le to, da jih ne bi z njihovih vrtičkov začeli izrivati ruski ali kitajski konkurenti. Takoj ko ti na evropskem pragu sklenejo kak posel ali dajo kakšno posojilo, pa iz Bruslja in Washingtona zadonijo velike besede o nevarnosti avtoritarizma, o napadu na evropske vrednote, o človekovih pravicah … Toda zakaj bi jih še kdo poslušal? Zakaj bi še kdo hotel iti po ukrajinski poti in verjel njihovim obljubam? Le kdo še hoče biti »borka na frontni črti« von der Leynove? Ali se smemo vendarle pogovarjati o resničnih interesih prebivalcev Evrope? Povejmo naglas: velika večina si nas ne želi blokovske delitve, ki nam jo ponovno vsiljujejo ameriški kapitalisti in njihovi evropski podizvajalci. Velika večina si nas ne želi nove hladne vojne v imenu »evropskih vrednot«. Velika večina ljudi – vključno z Ukrajinci, ki so množično glasovali za mirovnega kandidata Zelenskega – bi si želela politično, gospodarsko in kulturno sodelovanje z Rusijo in tudi z Zahodno Evropo. Vladajoči razredi nam te možnosti niso nikoli dopustili. \n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 8, "end": 29}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 58, "end": 101},

"lang": "sl", "text": "\nPorast migrantskega kriminala v Ljubljani: komu koristi, če se oblast pretvarja, da teh problemov ni?\n\nNaj si nekateri še tako zatiskajo oči, tudi Slovenijo je dohitela realnost nasilja in kriminala, ki ju povzročajo migrantski tokovi. Posilstva, pretepi, kraje, v zadnjem času pa opažamo tudi manifestacije islamskega ekstremizma, ki ga podžiga vrenje na Bližnjem vzhodu. Problematika je večplastna in težko rešljiva, skrbi pa dejstvo, da se o tem tako rekoč ne govori. Kot bi nekdo hotel izriniti te vse bolj pereče in za ljudi nevarne teme iz javnega diskurza.\n\nPolicijske statistike sleherne evropske države so, čeprav s strani vladajočih marsikdaj prikrite, vendarle kristalno jasne: največji vir ogrožanja varnosti na stari celini so ilegalni migranti. Čeprav še vedno predstavljajo majhen del prebivalstva evropskih držav, pa kot storilci kaznivih dejanj krepko prednjačijo pred staroselci. Ne vedno le v odstotkih, v nekaterih kategorijah tudi v absolutnih številkah, dejavnosti pa so se razširile od posilstev in tatvin tudi na področje organiziranega kriminala, kot je na primer razpečevanje drog, ne moremo pa niti mimo grožnje ponovnega vzpona islamskega terorizma. V imenu »svobodne Palestine« je Evropa že plačala prve nič krive smrtne žrtve.\n\nSlovenija na to dogajanje seveda ni imuna. Že do letošnjega septembra je bilo število obravnav posilstev, ki so jih zagrešili tujci iz tretjih držav, za 170 % večje od skupnega števila v lanskem letu: po podatkih Generalne policijske uprave je bilo do konca septembra letos obravnavanih že 19 kaznivih dejanj posilstva, povzročenih s strani tujih državljanov tretjih držav, lani pa celo leto 7. A ti podatki so iz medijev izvzeti, kolikor vem, si je o tem upala pisati le Družina. Srčno upam, da še kdo. Obenem smo priča dogodkom, kot je zadnji, ko je radikaliziran državljan Slovenije v družbi migranta iz Maroka grozil, da se bo razstrelil, ter ob glasnem predvajanju muslimanske molitve vzklikal »Alah Akbar!«. Takšna dejanja ne sodijo v naš kulturni prostor, nosijo pa jasno sporočilo: Slovenija je vse manj varna.\n\nVčasih je veljalo, da takšno obnašanje zavračajo le vzhodne članice EU, na Zahodu pa naj bi se morali ljudje temu podrediti. A ne le vzhod, tudi zahod počasi spoznava, da je popuščanje takšnemu načinu življenja nevarno. Zbudili so se Švedi, vse bolj ostri so Britanci, opogumili so se tudi Nemci. Evropa je sprevidela, da je tisto, česar se včasih zaradi nekakšne politične korektnosti ni smelo izreči, čista resnica: migranti s ciljnimi državami v splošnem niso kulturno kompatibilni, s finančno-gospodarskega vidika ne opravičujejo svoje prisotnosti, statistike kaznivih dejanj pa tudi govorijo svoje. Skratka, politika odprtih vrat prinaša več stroškov in trpljenja kot koristi.\n\nZato je potrebno to problematiko reševati ostro, jasno in odločno. A žal se policija sama ne more soočati z valovi ilegalnih migrantov in njihovimi kaznivimi dejanji, ker je že dolga leta kadrovsko podhranjena oziroma ima premalo ljudi na terenu (kje jih ima preveč, je že druga tema). Poleg tega učinkovitost policije drastično zmanjšujejo premajhna pooblastila ter prezapleteni birokratski postopki. Hkrati Slovenija nima ustrezne politike vračanja ilegalnih migrantov, niti ustreznega modela kaznovanja za zločine. Kot bi vse viselo nekje v zraku in čakalo na boljše čase. Oblast se pretvarja, da teh problemov ni. A zato ne bodo izginili, temveč bodo postali še večji.\n\nPasivnost leve opcije ob naraščajočih problemih\n\nMnogokrat smo že videli, da slovenska politika tudi namenoma zavira delovanje varnostnih organov. Spomnimo se blokad levice in Levice, ki je z vsemi sredstvi blokirala aktivacijo »zloglasnega« 35. člena, s katero bi na varovanje meje v pomoč policiji napotili vojsko. Na splošno je leva politična opcija do varnostne tematike nadvse ignorantska in kmalu se ji začne sistem podirati. Najprej bi odstranili tehnične ovire na južni meji, potem pa se sprašujejo, kaj zdaj, ko rasteta kriminal in nasilje nad državljani Slovenije. A problemov ne rešijo; rajši se obrnejo stran in prepustijo lastne državljane na milost in nemilost selitvi narodov.\n\nTa pasivnost ima podstat v levi progresivni ideologiji, kjer je novo dobro, staro pa slabo. Staro, tudi če deluje, je potrebno zamenjati z novim, ki najverjetneje ne deluje. Učinkovitost in pragmatizem tu nista pomembna, saj je del volilnega telesa vedno nagnjen k progresivizmu, kar zagotavlja uspeh in oblast. Tako so, glede na to, da z leve ni bilo kakšnih ostrih obsodb ali zgroženosti, denimo »nove« grožnje z razstrelitvijo ob divjih islamskih vzklikih sprejemljive. Čisto legitimno izražanje stališč, bi rekel marsikdo, mirna molitev za življenje pa je »versko nasilje«, ki ne spada v javnost, saj bojda širi klerikalizem. Povedano kaže, da v Sloveniji nimamo razumsko definiranih pravil, kaj se sme in kaj ne. Niti nimamo dovolj trdnih temeljev splošne morale, da bi znali ločiti med prav in narobe.\n\nRešitev varnostnih težav je v teoriji sicer izvedljiva, a potrebna bi bila sprememba politike. Svoje meje je potrebno varovati in lahko bi se česa naučili od Poljakov, ki že stoletja vedo, kako se brani Evropa. Večina držav, ki so se soočile z realnostjo kriminala, nasilja in terorizma, je obupala nad sanjami, kako bodo migranti rešili evropsko gospodarstvo in demografijo. Ne bodo je. Medtem predsednik vlade razmišlja, kako bi čim več migrantov zadržali pri nas, ker je to za Slovenijo dobro, papež Frančišek pa v svojem woke zanosu poziva k popolnemu odprtju migrantskih poti. Ekstremno lepe in ekstremno leve ideje, ki peljejo v pogubo.\n\nNevarnosti bo vse več\n\nNa drugi strani se spet vzpostavlja nadzor nad notranjimi mejami v EU. Pravilno in razumljivo, saj je postalo jasno, da je schengen v veliki meri propadel. Sicer lep koncept o zgolj zunanjih mejah, a EU na takšen pritisk nanje preprosto ni bila pripravljena. (Ne)delovanje schengna je pogojeno s političnimi ovirami, kadrovsko podhranjenostjo Frontexa, neenotnostjo držav k pristopu do varovanja meja in še čem. Potrebno bi bilo evropsko soglasje med državami in z Evropsko komisijo, ki bi vodilo v standardizacijo ter enotne postopke in obravnavo ilegalnih prebežnikov, a glede na živopisano sestavo in ideološko raznolikost evropskih vlad se v tem, čeprav mogoče do sedaj najbolj ključnem trenutku za varnost Evrope, to žal zdi nemogoče.\n\nKar je kratkovidno in neodgovorno, saj se bodo grožnje varnosti srednjeročno brezpogojno krepile. Razmere na Bližnjem vzhodu bodo prinesle močnejše migrantske tokove, neizbežno se bo ponovno okrepil islamski terorizem. Iz tega sledi vse večji strah med ljudmi, ki bodo, če bodo šle stvari predaleč, na neki točki želeli vzeti stvari v svoje roke. Tudi v Sloveniji smo že videli kaj podobnega. Tega si v demokratičnem svetu absolutno ne želimo, a če oblast ne more ali, kot se zdi v primeru Slovenije, celo noče zagotoviti varnosti, je to popolnoma razumljiva reakcija ljudi.\n\nVarnostna problematika sicer ni nerešljiva. Migrantske tokove je nujno potrebno zaustavljati. Nujno. Izraz krščanske ljubezni naj bo reševanje problematike v izvornih državah, in ne prinašanje trpljenja tako migrantom kot evropskim domačinom s politiko odprtih vrat. Ljudem je treba zagotoviti dostojno življenje v njihovi domovini oziroma jim je treba pomagati, da si ga zagotovijo sami. Nekateri za težave, ki jih migranti povzročajo, krivijo spodletelo integracijsko politiko. Ne drži. Tisti problematični se niso prišli integrirat. Kdor se hoče, se integrira po lastni volji, kdor pa se noče, ga k temu ne bodo pripravili niti najslajši švedski bonbončki.\n\nPrej sem omenil, da se o tej tematiki ni smelo govoriti resnice, ker je bila za nekatere boleča. Nekaterim je torej v interesu, da se resnica prikriva. Ocenil bi, da je to v interesu levega ideološkega pola, ki, kot omenjeno, s progresivizmom hoče spreminjati svet. Ko se progresivne ideje izkažejo za slabe, ko migranti posiljujejo in morijo, ko na naša vrata iz tujine potrkata nasilje in kriminal, je to treba prikriti, da se ideološka oziroma volilna baza ne obrne stran.\n\nŽal je ta princip močno prisoten tudi v Sloveniji, kjer, na primer, »depolitizirana« RTV o varnostni problematiki poroča prikrojeno, v skladu s svojo ideologijo. Politično-medijski kompleks je tako pripravljen prikrivati resnico in izkrivljati resničnost, s tem pa žrtvovati varnost svojih ljudi na oltarju volilnega uspeha in lepe zunanje podobe svoje ideologije.\n\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 0, "end": 45}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 46, "end": 88}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation",

Foram atingidas seis regiões ucranianas pelos bombardeamentos russos desta manhã, acrescentou.\n\nOutra pessoa morreu em Mikolaiv, no Sul do país, segundo o autarca da cidade. Os bombardeamentos atingiram 20 edifícios residenciais e causaram vários feridos.\n\nCidades como Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, e até Lviv, no extremo ocidental da Ucrânia, também foram atingidas por mísseis e drones. Os alarmes antiaéreos soaram em todas as províncias às primeiras horas da manhã. Em Kiev, um míssil russo atingiu uma linha de alta tensão, deixando várias casas sem electricidade, disse o presidente da autarquia, Vitali Klitschko.\n\nO alto-representante da União Europeia (UE) para a Política Externa e de Segurança, Josep Borrell, que está em Kiev em visita oficial, publicou uma fotografia na rede X em que está num abrigo subterrâneo. \"Esta é a realidade diária do corajoso povo ucraniano desde que a Rússia lançou a sua agressão ilegal\", escreveu o dirigente.\n\nSegundo o comandante das Forças Armadas, o general Valery Zaluzhny, foram interceptados 29 mísseis e 15 drones lançados pela Rússia esta manhã. Ao todo, as forças russas lançaram 64 mísseis e drones em vagas sucessivas.\n\nDesde o final do ano passado que a Rússia tem intensificado os bombardeamentos aéreos contra a generalidade do território ucraniano, principalmente visando os centros urbanos e as infra-estruturas ligadas à rede eléctrica. Para além de causar danos, o objectivo das forças russas é obrigar a Ucrânia a gastar as suas já escassas reservas de munições para interceptar os mísseis e drones que entram no seu espaço aéreo.\n\nO Ministério da Defesa russo revelou, por seu turno, que as suas defesas antiaéreas destruíram sete mísseis e dois drones que sobrevoavam a região fronteiriça de Belgorod, que tem sido visada por bombardeamentos ucranianos.

A obtenção desse documento seria uma condição prévia para receber serviços consulares. Propõe igualmente sanções mais severas para a evasão ao recrutamento, incluindo o congelamento de bens, e prevê convocatórias online, o que tornaria mais difícil evitar o recrutamento.\n\nSe a lei for aprovada na próxima fase do Parlamento, a idade a partir da qual as pessoas podem ser mobilizadas para o serviço militar será reduzida de 27 para 25 anos. As pessoas que prestaram serviço contínuo por 36 meses durante a guerra podem ser dispensadas, mas tal não acontecerá automaticamente.\n\n\"Trata-se de uma lista de soluções complexas mas extremamente necessárias, concebidas para tornar o nosso Estado mais forte face aos desafios de uma guerra de longa duração\", afirmou o Ministério da Defesa após a votação."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 4949, "end": 5026}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 6322, "end": 6404}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 7144, "end": 7172}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 7175, "end": 7269}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 7272, "end": 7426}], "article_id": "43101", "lang": "pt", "text": "Portugueses vão investigar alterações climáticas na Antártica a bordo de veleiro\n\nPela primeira vez, na fronteira entre o mar e a terra, durante 15 dias, uma expedição científica portuguesa vai estar a bordo de um veleiro de 24 metros, capaz de fazer chegar os investigadores até às baías da Península Antártica de mais difícil acesso.  \n\nDurante duas semanas, o El Doblón, veleiro turístico alugado para a missão, será o novo laboratório de uma equipa de investigadores das universidades de Lisboa, Algarve e Coimbra e das universidades Autónoma de Madrid, responsáveis por dez projetos que vão desde as ciências naturais até às ciências sociais. Pretende desvendar como as alterações climáticas estão a influenciar as temperaturas e os solos das zonas costeiras daquela península no hemisfério Sul.  \n\nO “COASTANTAR 2024” é a primeira expedição portuguesa de veleiro pelas baíaas escondias na “pontinha da vírgula” da Antártica, zonas onde os cientistas encontrarão áreas livres de gelo e rochosas.  “Assistimos agora a um novo retorno do aquecimento nesta região. A temperatura tinha subido muito desde que há registo, entre 1950 e até ao ano 2000. Depois estabilizou, desceu um pouco, e começámos a ter verões com mais neve porque houve uma mudança da posição das cinturas de vento. Mas, a partir de 2015, voltámos à tendência rápida de aquecimento, pelo que será interessante observar os seus impactos”, sublinhou, em declarações ao JN, Gonçalo Vieira, coordenador da expedição e investigador do Instituto de Geografia e Ordenamento do Território (IGOT) da Universidade de Lisboa, à margem da apresentação da missão, esta sexta-feira, em Lisboa.  \n\nA primeira expedição do geógrafo físico foi em 2000, mas esta será a primeira vez que irá trabalhar a bordo de um veleiro. “Neste momento, estou curioso para ver de que maneira é que a fusão do solo gelado e, essencialmente, os episódios extremos de temperatura e precipitação, que estão a ser mais frequentes, estão a ter impactos ao nível da erosão. Mas também vamos trabalhar nos fluxos de contaminantes e olhar para as encostas, tentar começar a monitorizar essas áreas, ligando com imagens satélite para ver que impactos é que está a ter na paisagem”, explicou Gonçalo Vieira.  \n\nOs investigadores, cada um responsável por um projeto diferente, irá desenvolver as suas observações e recolher amostras de contaminantes na água, neve, gelo e solo, de microrganismos na atmosfera e em espécies marinhas, fitoplâncton e microplásticos pelas zonas costeiras. A missão decorrerá durante um mês, mas o sucesso de cada dia de trabalho no terreno irá depender das condições meteorológicas e do mar. Nesta altura do ano, a equipa de cientistas irá apanhar o verão na Antártica, com tempo frio a 1ºC e a água do mar com temperaturas a rondar os zero graus, apontou o coordenador durante a apresentação. \n\nOs cientistas irão partir já no domingo, 28 de janeiro, com destino a Punta Arenas, no Chile. Daí deverão embarcar no voo antártico português, na quinta-feira, 1 de fevereiro, para uma base científica chilena, na ilha de Rei Jorge, arquipélago de Shetland do Sul. Se o vento soprar a favor da equipa científica, irão embarcar nesta ilha a 5 de fevereiro, com destino ao arquipélago de Palmer. Pelo caminho irão parar em várias ilhas da península no hemisfério sul: a ilha Livingston, ilha Deception, Cierva Cove, Estreito de Gerlache, Base Palmer e ilhas Melchior. De regresso à ilha de Rei Jorge a 20 de fevereiro, a investigação passará a ser feita apenas em terra. O regresso a Portugal do primeiro grupo de investigadores está previsto para 29 de fevereiro. \n\nMais do que ter uma infraestrutura permanente na Antártica, a comunidade científica portuguesa tem manifestado ao longo do tempo a sua vontade de chegar ao terreno. Dessa necessidade surgiu a ideia de criar um veleiro que pudesse ser usado para apoiar a investigação ainda em 2007, ano em que arrancou mais um Ano Polar Internacional. O \"COASTANTAR\" foi aprovado em 2020, e depois dos atrasos da pandemia estará no terreno já na próxima semana. \n\nEquipa de 16 a bordo num veleiro de 24 metros  \n\nO número de pessoas a bordo ascende às 16 com uma realizadora que irá realizar um documentário sobre a missão e os tripulantes. O espaço é um dos grandes desafios. A organização dentro do veleiro foi pensada quase ao milímetro para conseguirem arrumar 400 kg de equipamento necessário às investigações. “É óbvio que o espaço limita a nossa atividade científica, mas é uma experiência com aprendizagens para missões futuras. Perceber se será melhor levarmos menos gente de cada vez porque agora já enchemos os lugares e chegámos à conclusão de que é preciso gerir muito bem a maneira como organizamos o espaço para trabalhar”, afirmou o especialista.  \n\nMas a grande mais-valia de usar um veleiro, aponta o coordenador, é permitir à equipa de cientistas chegar a zonas mais remotas, onde a ação humana não está tão presente. Além disso, é uma solução que reduz em muito o impacto ambiental de missões desta natureza. “A ideia por detrás deste modelo é mostrar que conseguimos, com um veleiro, ter uma pegada ecológica reduzida. Naturalmente também iremos andar a motor porque há locais em que será mais seguro fazê-lo, mas não se compara uma embarcação pequena com um grande navio oceanográfico”. \n\nA Carlos Vital, assistente de pesquisa, cabe apoiar logisticamente toda a missão. “Irei na expedição para garantir todo o apoio necessário nos voos, como também para ajudar cada um dos investigadores, seja em terra seja no veleiro. Haverá muito trabalho a fazer em pouco tempo. Além dos 15 dias já serem poucos, o tempo é também reduzido por causa das condições atmosféricas, o que faz com que seja necessário aproveitar todos os minutos”.\n\nOutro objetivo da expedição será também monitorizar a expansão de vegetação em zonas que, em tempos, já estiveram cobertas de gelo e começar a analisar o risco do trabalho de investigadores e técnicos das estações científicas presentes numa das regiões mais suscetíveis do Mundo às alterações climáticas. \n\nA experiência será documentada por Madalena Boto que se juntou à missão para, através da imagem, “aproximar as pessoas da ciência”. A ideia é que a realizadora filme o dia a dia durante o mês da missão com vista a um documentário que deverá sair ainda este ano. “Estaremos num ambiente bastante inóspito, com vários desafios e num espaço limitado, mas tenho boas expectativas. Cada projeto tem características muito diferentes, com objetos de estudo específicos em ambientes diferentes, alguns no mar, outros na terra e nas zonas mais litorais, mas estão todos a trabalhar para um objetivo comum”. Além disso, no site da expedição será feito um diário de bordo para que qualquer um acompanhe a missão a milhares de km de distância.  \n\nContribuir para um esforço global \n\nTodas as amostras recolhidas seguirão, congeladas, para Espanha para serem posteriormente utilizadas pela equipa já de volta aos seus laboratórios. Desta missão espera-se um contributo para agir face às alterações climáticas. “A comunidade científica já deu indicações há muito tempo do que é que se tem de mudar. O que é fundamental é agirmos. Todos os projetos vão contribuir para construir a ciência e gerir melhor o território antártico. É uma missão pequena, de baixo custo, mas ocupa nichos da ciência importantes e que, com publicações internacionais, vão contribuir para um esforço global”, advertiu Gonçalo Vieira.\n\nPrevê-se que os resultados sejam apresentados durante o verão numa conferência internacional do Comitê Científico sobre Pesquisa Antártica (Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research). Seguir-se-ão meses de divulgação a nível nacional, em partilha com os ministérios da Ciência, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior e dos Negócios Estrangeiros, mas também com o velho continente através do European Polar Board, órgão que une as agências europeias financiadoras de investigação polar.  \n\nEmbora o financiamento possa representar uma barreira, Gonçalo Vieira acredita que no futuro venham a ser realizadas mais expedições em veleiro, em articulação com outros programas parceiros, num modelo de rotatividade de equipas por períodos de tempo mais longos. “Imaginemos que o veleiro se mantém em continuidade durante um ou dois meses. Durante esses meses podem entrar várias equipas portuguesas e internacionais e o veleiro faz missões contínuas em que se vai rodando as equipas científicas”. \n\nA expedição, organizada em conjunto pelo Pograma Polar Português (PROPOLAR/FCT) e o Colégio de Ciências Polares e de Ambientes Extremos da Universidade de Lisboa (POLAR2E/ULISBOA), é cofinanciada em 150 mil euros pela Universidade de Lisboa e a Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT).

dimensões do aborto desejado\n\nEste texto de opinião é sobre o aborto voluntário. O direto ao aborto é uma questão de autonomia que está constantemente a ser posta em causa. Não me refiro aos abortos por má formação fetal ou em caso de violação, mas às interrupções voluntárias da gravidez desejadas pelos mais diversos motivos.\n\nUm terço dos hospitais em Portugal são objetores de consciência — não realizam interrupção voluntária da gravidez, vulgo aborto, daqui em diante identificada também como “IVG”. No entanto, este artigo não se debruçará sobre a lei do aborto em si, devidamente relatada no artigo de Carolina Monteiro – Mestranda em Medicina, pós-graduada em Sexualidade Humana – sobre a implementação da Lei do Aborto. Além disso, esta crónica não menospreza, de todo, todas as mulheres que anseiam por ser mães e não conseguem, que têm abortos espontâneos de fetos queridos, nem pais e mães que procuram adoptar crianças.\n\nUm pouco de contexto\n\nAntes de 1984, qualquer tipo de aborto, independentemente do contexto, era proibido em Portugal. Como refere Carolina Monteiro, com as devidas fontes, “Nesta altura, ocorriam entre 100 mil e 200 mil abortos clandestinos por ano, dos quais 2% terminaram na morte de mulheres. A primeira lei sobre a sua licitude apenas incluía alguns casos: perigo de vida física e psíquica para a mulher, por violação e/ou malformação do feto. Embora tenha sido um primeiro passo para a lei atual, as suas condições restritas levaram a que 98% dos abortos ocorressem na clandestinidade .”\n\nPor muito que já tenham passado 39 anos desde o primeiro passo em direção à descriminalização do aborto e 16 anos desde o último referendo em que ganhou o “sim”, o pudor em relação ao aborto continua em alta. Este é um dos direitos humanos de autonomia mais postos em causa na política, não tivesse recentemente acontecido a revogação desse mesmo direito nos EUA . Mesmo a nível nacional, com o ressurgimento de partidos de direita extremamente conservadores, vemos a bandeira antiaborto tida como “pró-vida” a ser hasteada mais uma vez.\n\nSer a favor da legalização do aborto não quer dizer que queira abortar\n\nUma pessoa que é a favor da legalização da IVG não é uma pessoa que necessariamente queira abortar se engravidar, são questões independentes. Eu posso nunca querer abortar voluntariamente na vida, mas ser a favor de que haja essa escolha com segurança para quem o quiser fazer. Até porque, antes da legalização (e mesmo agora, quando há a impossibilidade de obter a IVG por algum motivo) as mulheres punham a vida em risco, e até morriam, ao fazer abortos caseiros ou em clínicas clandestinas, contraindo infecções graves, fazendo perfurações do útero, tendo dor extrema, tudo isto sem nenhum apoio.\n\nA mulher que decide abortar\n\nNenhuma mulher anseia por um dia ter de fazer uma IVG. Nenhuma. Nenhuma adora passar pelo processo, seja com medicamentos ou intervenção cirúrgica. Não é um processo fácil para o corpo: é doloroso, física e psicologicamente, com a agravante de termos a sociedade, e até alguns profissionais de saúde, a incutir culpa na mulher. A mulher que quer uma IVG, simplesmente não quer estar grávida e não quer ser mãe, pelo menos naquela fase da sua vida.\n\nAté recentemente, praticamente nenhuma mulher que tivesse passado por uma IVG o admitiria. Felizmente, hoje as coisas começaram a mudar. Conheço várias mulheres que o fizeram e falam abertamente sobre isso. Algumas são agora mães, porque quiseram, porque já têm condições económicas e emocionais para isso. Uma das vozes públicas que fala abertamente sobre a sua IVG é a atriz Jameela Jamil.\n\nImporta, então, combater o estereótipo de que as mulheres que decidem abortar são as irresponsáveis que não querem saber das consequências da sua “promiscuidade”, que usam “o aborto como método contraceptivo” – expressão errónea, porque já houve concepção, e típico de quem não sabe o que uma IVG acarreta física e psicologicamente. Neste processo de julgamento, raramente se põe em causa o homem que libertou o espermatozóide que fecundou o óvulo. Como piada, até se pode dizer que o óvulo estava lá descansadinho, um paz de alma, na maior parte das vezes sozinho, quando de repente chega um batalhão de espermatozóides, como se fosse a meta de um sprint de 100 metros.\n\nAs mulheres que decidem fazer uma IVG não são somente as “irresponsáveis”. Aliás, já basta de se colocar a responsabilidade contracepcional sempre para cima da mulher… E mesmo que seja uma adolescente que não usou qualquer tipo de contraceptivo, está no seu direito de fazer uma IVG e não merece julgamento, merece apoio e informação. Não só ela, como o rapaz. Se é para chamar de irresponsável, chamem aos dois. Além disso, qualquer método contraceptivo pode falhar. Qualquer um. Não obstante, o relatório de 2018 relativo às IVGs mostra que o grupo etário dos 15 aos 19 anos representa 9,28% das IVGs, próximo do grupo dos 40 aos 44 anos, com 8,24%.\n\nEste retrato estereotipado de irresponsabilidade, para além de problemático, como vimos, é erróneo. Não há uma caracterização única das pessoas que procuram IVGs:\n\nMulheres que sabem que se continuarem a gravidez vão ter de ser mães solteiras e não têm nem condições económicas, nem sociais, nem uma rede de apoio;\n\nPessoas que para continuarem com a gravidez têm de parar medicação que lhes dá qualidade de vida;\n\nMulheres que já têm muitos filhos e não têm como suportar mais ou simplesmente não querem mais;\n\nPessoas que sabem que não têm, pelo menos de momento, estabilidade emocional para continuarem como a gravidez;\n\nSituações em que o companheiro que não usou preservativo ou que o tirou sem ela reparar a meio da relação sexual (este último ato é chamado de “ stealthing ”, e é considerado uma violação);\n\nCasais que usaram preservativo e houve uma fuga sem que tivessem reparado;\n\nMulheres que tomaram a pílula contraceptiva de emergência, mas não resultou por algum motivo, como aconteceu com Jameela Jamil. (A atriz contou que, apenas seis horas depois da relação sexual em que o preservativo rompeu, ela tomou a pílula. O/A farmacêutico/a não a avisou que a pílula poderia perder eficácia quando a pessoa que a toma tem peso acima de certo valor. Conclusão: ela fez tudo bem e engravidou na mesma, dado o seu peso na altura.)\n\nPor último, o único motivo que é preciso para se fazer uma IVG é a pessoa que está grávida não querer estar grávida. O argumento de “não quer a criança que a tenha e a dê para adoção”, não tem em consideração, de todo, as implicações da gravidez no corpo de uma mulher. Esse chamado “estado de graça” só o é para quem pode e para quem o quer. Querer uma IVG não é só sobre não querer ser mãe, é sobre não querer, ou até não ter condições, para se estar grávida. Não falo só das questões físicas durante a gravidez – alterações hormonais, desconforto, problemas dentários, necessidade de suplementos, consultas, e todos os gastos e apoio necessário que isto acarreta –, mas também do custoso pós-parto ainda pouco falado graças ao embelezamento do processo da gravidez e da maternidade como um mundo encantado e maravilhoso (quando é desejada, pode ter tanto de maravilhoso como de desgastante). Imaginem, agora, passar por tudo isto quando não se quer estar grávida ou ser mãe.\n\nAlém disso, está provado cientificamente que o feto não sente dor antes das 20 semanas . Sendo que em Portugal é possível fazer IVG até às 10 – no resto da União Europeia são 12 semanas – não há risco de dor para o feto.\n\nEducação Sexual e o peso da contraceção que as mulheres acarretam\n\nÉ preciso, sem dúvida, aumentar a literacia corporal e sexual de toda a população, de todas as idades, sem pudor, e normalizar o direito a impor limites sobre o seu próprio corpo.\n\nDesta forma, é indispensável a existência de Educação Sexual e a sua centralização no prazer e consentimento, para além da proteção. Mostrar como funciona o corpo humano, ser-se inclusiva em termos de sexualidade e falar de todos os métodos contraceptivos e de como, e em que contexto, os utilizar devidamente.\n\nAtualmente, existem 20 métodos contraceptivos disponíveis ao público , sendo que apenas o preservativo protege as pessoas envolvidas de Infeções Sexuais Transmissíveis. Deve ser utilizado mesmo quando a relação sexual não acarreta risco de gravidez.\n\nAcima de tudo, qualquer método é falível, especialmente se for mal utilizado. Por isso, a única forma de conseguir que não haja mesmo possibilidades de gravidezes indesejadas seria pregar e praticar o celibato. Como é que isto seria viável? Não sejamos inocentes. Tal seria contrariar a natureza do corpo humano, para além de ser nocivo para a saúde mental, atribuindo culpa ao ato natural sexual.\n\nÉ relevante deixar a nota de que uma das coisas mais irónicas quanto ao desejo de alguns partidos de proibir educação sexual nas escolas, por a considerarem promíscua, é que esses mesmos partidos são contra o aborto voluntário. Se as pessoas não souberem devidamente como funcionam os métodos contraceptivos, como vão evitar gravidezes indesejadas?\n\nA pílula que não é só do dia seguinte\n\nAo contrário do que muita gente pensa, a pílula “do dia seguinte” não é abortiva: se a fecundação já tiver acontecido, não provoca o aborto. Por esta razão, quando mais cedo for tomada após a relação sexual desprotegida, maior a sua eficácia.\n\nMesmo assim, há a ideia errada, até pelo nome que comumente lhe é atribuído, de que só é possível tomar no dia seguinte para ser eficaz. Como se pode ler no site do SNS24 , a pílula “deve ser tomada dentro das 72 horas após as relações desprotegidas e no máximo até ao 5º. dia, sendo que quanto mais cedo for tomada, maior a sua eficácia”.\n\nSe forem comprar a pílula de contracepção de emergência – nome mais correto – façam as vossas perguntas à/ao farmacêutica/o sem pudor. Se vos calhar um/a funcionário/a que vos está nitidamente a julgar – aconteceu-me há uns anos –, o meu conselho é que vão a outra farmácia. “Não estou confortável com a sua postura. Vou a outra farmácia, com licença.” O preconceito que alguém tem sobre ti nunca é culpa tua.\n\nContinua a haver, muitas vezes, o receio de tomar esta pílula por ser uma “bomba”. Como já disse Patrícia Lemos, é preciso ter cuidado nesta associação de contracepção de emergência a “bomba” porque é menos “bomba” para o corpo uma pílula de contraceção de emergência do que uma IVG.\n\nO lado do homem que não tem poder\n\nÉ natural que possa haver um sentimento de impotência por parte do homem que não pode decidir sobre a continuação ou não de uma gravidez da qual também ele foi responsável. Mesmo assim, o útero não é dele, a decisão não pode ser dele. O que pode fazer é apoiar a mulher que decidiu continuar ou não com a gravidez.\n\nOra, na eventualidade do homem querer ser pai, não pode obrigar alguém que não o quer fazer a passar pelo processo moroso da gravidez e do consequente pós-parto. Por outro lado, se não quer ser pai, pelo menos agora, e vai ser, o que acarreta preocupações emocionais e monetárias, compreendo que possa ser muito desafiante. Mesmo assim, o útero não é dele, a decisão não é dele.\n\nAproveito este último caso como um argumento para impulsionarem, finalmente, a comercialização de uma pílula hormonal contraceptiva para pessoas com pénis. As investigações existem.\n\nNotas finais\n\nMesmo sendo legal realizar uma IVG em Portugal, continua a haver imenso pudor a falar no assunto e uma culpa quase automaticamente associada, impulsionada quer por parte da sociedade, quer por muitos profissionais de saúde. Este entrave meio encoberto em relação às IVGs é ainda apoiado pela falta de apoio psicológico após IVG.\n\nO direito ao aborto é uma questão de autonomia e de consentimento, de a mulher fazer o que quer com o seu corpo e com a sua vida, com segurança. Porque, quem quer abortar, vai abortar. A legalização permite que quem o faz, o faça com segurança, preservando a sua vida.\n\nÉ literalmente desumano querer obrigar alguém a ser mãe.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 0, "end": 72}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 10, "end": 15}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 76, "end": 191}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 194, "end": 260}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 444, "end": 748}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 778, "end": 813}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 778, "end": 1033}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1306, "end": 1421}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1398, "end": 1410}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 2158, "end": 2225}], "article_id": "43104", "lang": "pt", "text": "\"Política míope\" do Ocidente ajudou Rússia a aproximar-se de \"sul global\"\n\n\"Os planos da minoria ocidental de isolar a Rússia e criar uma espécie de cordão sanitário em nosso redor fracassaram.

Porém, enquanto judeu, e enquanto cidadão da União Europeia, acredito que a gravidade do momento me impele a fazê-lo.\n\nA 13 de outubro, na passada sexta-feira, as forças militares de Israel comunicaram a 1,1 milhões de residentes da zona norte da Faixa de Gaza que deveriam abandonar as suas casas num prazo de 24 horas, sob pena de verem as suas vidas ceifadas pela intervenção militar israelita. No mesmo dia, as Presidentes da Comissão Europeia e do Parlamento Europeu deslocaram-se a Israel, numa missão de solidariedade para com o país e o seu povo, no seguimento dos ataques devastadores da semana anterior. A visita incluiu uma deslocação ao kibutz de Kfar Aza, palco de um dos massacres cometidos pelo Hamas, e uma série de tweets com manifestações de apoio ao país enlutado.\n\nEnquanto figuras máximas de duas das mais importantes instituições da União Europeia, era expectável que von der Leyen e Metsola, bem como os líderes dos 27 Estados Membros, transmitissem a sua solidariedade a Israel, e que simultaneamente condenassem a chacina de 7 de outubro. O que não se esperava, não obstante, era o silêncio ensurdecedor diante da desproporcionada e ilegal retaliação por parte de Israel, por via da punição coletiva e transferência forçada, em flagrante violação de normas de Direito Internacional, que se insere na senda de várias décadas de opressão ao povo palestiniano. No mínimo dos mínimos, perante os acontecimentos volvidos na passada semana, esperava-se das Presidentes da Comissão e Parlamento apelos urgentes a um cessar-fogo imediato e à abertura de corredores de segurança para a entrada de ajuda humanitária, e esforços diplomáticos no sentido de promover uma desescalada do conflito.\n\nO que se verificou foi uma abordagem abertamente facciosa e a manifestação de um apoio sem reservas ao regime criminoso de Netanyahu, tristemente ilustrada por uma fotografia partilhada no X (antigo Twitter) de Roberta Metsola. Na publicação, Metsola surge de mãos dadas com von der Leyen e, ao centro, o Presidente Israelita Isaac Herzog. A descrição da fotografia, “together”, deixa um sabor amargo na boca e uma questão inconveniente no ar: será então a UE patrocinadora da resposta implacável do estado judaico?\n\nInfelizmente, a já conhecida ambiguidade da União, especialmente no que toca a momentos de crise, tem vindo a acentuar-se e acaba a esfregar sal na ferida. Num exemplo gritante dos problemas de comunicação das instituições, o Comissário Olivér Várhelyi, responsável pelo alargamento e vizinhança, anunciou a 9 de outubro a suspensão de todos os pagamentos de ajudas à Palestina. Valeu a rápida reação de vários países, incluindo de Portugal, que se opuseram à decisão unilateral da Comissão sem consulta prévia dos Estados Membros. Horas depois, o Comissário Janez Lenarčič, responsável pela pasta de ajuda humanitária e gestão de crises, veio esclarecer que a ajuda humanitária da UE à Palestina continuará pelo tempo que for necessário.\n\nEstes avanços e recuos, e a manifesta hesitação em exigir de Jerusalém que opere estritamente no quadro das leis da guerra são por demais inquietantes, especialmente no contexto das Eleições Europeias que se avizinham. Importa lembrar que, em 2019, a Comissão von der Leyen delineou seis prioridades essenciais para o seu mandato, entre as quais uma Europa mais forte no mundo, e a promoção do modo de vida europeu. Quando em 2024 se deslocarem às urnas, verão os europeus nestas posições um reflexo das promessas feitas cinco anos antes? Ou será este mais um tiro no pé do executivo da UE, numa altura em que abundam as tensões na vizinhança da União?\n\nEnquanto europeus, conhecemos bem os acontecimentos trágicos que proliferaram na primeira metade do século XX. São-nos relatados desde tenra idade, e constituem parte fundamental da nossa identidade cultural e memória coletiva. Enquanto judeu, é confrangedor testemunhar os crimes perpetrados por Israel, uma suposta democracia moderna. A opressão sobre o povo palestiniano, e a progressiva ocupação do seu território, ao arrepio da resolução aprovada pelas Nações Unidas em 1947, traduzem-se não só numa lenta empreitada para apagar um povo que há gerações vê naquela região a sua casa, como numa traição a todos os judeus que viram os seus próprios direitos negados e o seu povo dizimado. Como tal, a conivência e o apoio que aporta a UE ao que aparenta não ser nada senão uma nova tentativa de limpeza étnica são revoltantes e inaceitáveis.\n\nNa alvorada do pós-Segunda Guerra Mundial, foi proclamado que nunca mais se permitiria tamanho horror e tamanha afronta à mais elementar dignidade humana. É nosso dever agora assegurar que “nunca mais” será, efetivamente, “nunca mais”, tanto lá como cá, em todo o lado, sempre e para sempre. É dever dos nossos líderes honrar os compromissos feitos ao longo de quase 80 anos para que se erradiquem a fome, a pobreza, e a guerra. É urgente que façam mais.

A Ucrânia anunciou no início desta semana que tinha retirado as suas forças da aldeia de Krokhmalne, em Kharkiv, a fim de assumir posições defensivas mais vantajosas em terrenos mais elevados, enquanto os relatórios sugerem que as forças russas continuaram a exercer pressão na área.\n\nO Estado-Maior do exército ucraniano afirmou que as forças ucranianas tinham enfrentado 13 ataques nas proximidades de Krokhmalne, em Tabaiivka, a noroeste da aldeia, e em Stelmakhivka, a sul.\n\n\"O inimigo está a concentrar-se num grande número de ataques de artilharia, tentando avançar\", disse um porta-voz do Comando das Forças Terrestres à televisão ucraniana sobre a situação perto de Krokhmalne.\n\nAs linhas da frente, concentradas no leste e no sul da Ucrânia, têm estado praticamente paradas há meses, depois de a contraofensiva ucraniana ter sido, no verão passado, largamente repelida pelas defesas russas, fortemente fortificadas. Mas a recente vaga de ofensivas russas surge numa altura em que a Ucrânia avisou que está a enfrentar uma escassez crítica de munições, com a guerra a aproximar-se do seu aniversário de dois anos.\n\nAs forças ucranianas também se dizem confrontadas com uma pressão crescente mais a sudeste, na área em torno de Bakhmut, que foi o principal foco da ofensiva de inverno da Rússia há um ano. Os esforços da Rússia têm-se concentrado no sudoeste da cidade, em torno das aldeias de Klishchiivka e Andriivka, em grande parte destruídas, de acordo com o sargento Oles Maliarevych, da 92ª Brigada Separada.\n\n\"O inimigo está a acumular forças... atacam todos os dias\", disse Maliarevych à televisão ucraniana.\n\nMaliarevych sublinhou a enorme ameaça que representam atualmente os drones, que têm tido um impacto cada vez mais significativo no campo de batalha ao longo do último ano. Segundo ele, os russos têm muito mais drones do que a Ucrânia, incluindo drones equipados com visão noturna.\n\nKlishchiivka e Andriivka representam os limites mais orientais dos modestos ganhos territoriais da Ucrânia em torno de Bakhmut, a terra recuperada em setembro como parte da contraofensiva da Ucrânia.\n\nMas os ganhos da Ucrânia no verão passado foram modestos. No que se esperava ser um primeiro passo importante para quebrar o corredor terrestre da Rússia para a Crimeia, as suas forças tentaram avançar para sul a partir da cidade de Orikhiv em direção a Tokmak, mas só conseguiram chegar a Robotyne, pouco mais de 20 quilómetros a sul.\n\nOleksandr Shtupun, porta-voz das forças armadas ucranianas que é responsável pelas operações a sul na região de Zaporizhzhia, afirmou que os esforços da Rússia estavam agora direcionados para a recuperação de territórios reclamados pela Ucrânia.\n\n\"Em suma, os invasores estão muito ativos, aumentaram o número de operações ofensivas e de assalto.

Para alguns analistas, a resposta à descoberta das IDF pode estar, precisamente, na relação próxima entre Pequim e Teerão.\n\n“Será que os chineses sabiam que [as armas] eram para o Hamas ou será que chegaram [a Gaza] através de terceiros, como o Irão?”, questiona Patrick Bury, especialista em Segurança na Universidade de Bath e antigo funcionário da NATO.\n\n“Tratando-se de uma grande quantidade [de armas], é muito provável que esteja envolvido um Estado interveniente e é muito provável que esse Estado interveniente seja o Irão.

Palestina Livre\".\n\nNa concentração, pessoas de todas as idades, mas com predominância acima dos 50 anos, muitos e muitas com lenços palestinianos, que acorreram à convocatória das organizações promotoras: CGTP- Intersindical Nacional, Comité Português para a Paz e Cooperação (CPPC), Movimento pelos direitos do povo palestiniano e pela paz no Médio Oriente (MPPM) e Projeto Ruído - Associação juvenil.\n\nAo som de música palestiniana, ecoa a primeira palavra de ordem \"Palestina vencerá!\", pouco antes da chegada de Mariana Mortágua e Paulo Raimundo, líderes do Bloco de Esquerda e do PCP, que decidiram juntar-se ao acontecimento.\n\nUma palestiniana com um vestido tradicional de noiva discursa em inglês e dessa forma homenageia uma amiga que diz ter sido morta no dia do casamento pelos bombardeamentos israelitas em Gaza, iniciados um dia após o ataque surpresa do movimento islamita Hamas a 7 de outubro e que se prolongaram até 24 de novembro. Tudo antes do início da mobilizadora \"ação artística\", como foi depois anunciado.\n\nA dirigente do BE, Mariana Mortágua, destacou nas declarações aos 'media' o \"simbolismo especial deste dia, que também serve para relembrar \"o massacre que o Estado de Israel levou a cabo contra o povo de Gaza\", numa referência os cerca de 15.000 mortos anunciados pelas autoridades locais, controladas pelo movimento islamita Hamas.\n\n\"Gaza é o maior cemitério de crianças do mundo e hoje vive uma crise. Esta pausa humanitária veio tarde, não basta, é preciso exigir um cessar-fogo do Estado de Israel\", disse.\n\nA líder do BE também denunciou a \"hipocrisia da comunidade internacional e de muitos Estados, quando milhares de pessoas continuam a morrer\", e considerou que Portugal \"deveria ter apoiado as posições de António Guterres\", secretário-geral da ONU, que denunciou massacres e exigiu um cessar-fogo imediato -- \"em vez de ter posições dúbias, e obrigar Israel a um cessar-fogo\". \"É preciso uma ação internacional\", afirmou.\n\nNa perspetiva da dirigente bloquista, e na sequência de ter sido admitido o reconhecimento unilateral do Estado palestiniano por países europeus como Espanha e Bélgica, o Governo português \"coloca-se numa posição muito confortável de dizer que só reconhece a autodeterminação do Estado da Palestina se a União Europeia o reconhecer. É inaceitável\".\n\nNo decurso desta sua deslocação à região durante a semana passada, e durante uma paragem na sexta-feira no lado egípcio de Rafah, a única passagem fronteiriça aberta com a Faixa de Gaza, o primeiro-ministro espanhol Pedro Sánchez admitiu que a Espanha pode reconhecer de forma unilateral a Palestina caso os restantes parceiros europeus não se decidam por um reconhecimento coordenado.\n\n\"As Nações Unidas já o reconheceram, o Parlamento português já o reconheceu, o Governo português tem de reconhecer a autodeterminação do povo palestiniano. Portugal tem de defender o direito internacional\", enfatizou Mortágua.\n\nA dirigente do BE sublinhou ainda que a paz na região apenas será possível quando for reconhecido o direito do povo palestiniano ao seu Estado.\n\n\"O Governo português tem essa posição hipócrita, não devemos depender da vontade União Europeia a nossa vontade para cumprir o direito internacional, Portugal tem um dever, cumprir o direito internacional e fazer todas as diligências para um cessar-fogo e pela paz\", adiantou.\n\nUma posição idêntica foi também assinalada por Paulo Raimundo, que pugnou pela que atual pausa humanitária \"se converta no que é necessário e urgente, num cessar-fogo, imediato, verdadeiro, que acabe com a guerra e o massacre que está em curso\".\n\nPara o secretário-geral do PCP, a pausa humanitária em curso \"demonstra que é possível dialogar, abrir caminhos que não os caminhos da guerra, para resolver um problema de há muitos anos a esta parte\". \"Aproveitar este espaço que está aberto para fazer entrar ajuda humanitária, que se acabe com o massacre, com a guerra, e evitar qualquer manobra de hipocrisia ou cinismo que volte aos bombardeamentos e ao massacre do povo palestiniano\", adiantou.\n\nAinda numa referência às posições assumidas por Portugal, Paulo Raimundo referiu-se aos países da União Europeia como \"refugiados na ideia de que ou vão todos ou não vai ninguém, e a tradução é que praticamente nenhum país reconheceu a Palestina como um Estado\".\n\nE sublinhou: \"Agora a questão decisiva, e era bom que o Estado português, o Estado espanhol, o Estado belga, obrigassem ao cumprimento das resoluções das Nações Unidas, as mais recentes e as anteriores, e que constituíssem todos o que é decisivo, aproveitar esta pausa humanitária para garantir o apoio humanitário (...) e para que se estabeleça um cessar-fogo e o caminho da paz no Médio Oriente, que tem consequências na vida dos palestinianos e de todos nós\".\n\nO Dia Internacional de Solidariedade com o Povo da Palestina é assinalado anualmente a 29 de novembro. O seu objetivo é sensibilizar a comunidade internacional para o direito de autodeterminação do povo palestiniano, bem como reafirmar o compromisso e a solidariedade que a Organização das Nações Unidas tem para com este povo.

Construída de pedra e cal sobre uma luta de várias décadas, um segundo referendo e uma maioria social forjada pela sociedade civil, o movimento feminista e os profissionais de saúde, a Lei n.º 16/2007, que consagrou o direito ao acesso ao aborto seguro, gratuito e a pedido da pessoa grávida, tornou Portugal um país melhor e mais democrático.\n\nPassados 17 anos da despenalização da IVG, importa olhar para o estado das coisas, mais do que emoldurar a vitória no referendo e pendurá-la numa ala da democracia portuguesa. Nomear os recuos e o que permanece por fazer, recusando regressar ao debate entre a clandestinidade do passado e o direito, mas fazendo do mesmo memória e combustível para disputar a alteração de uma lei do antigamente e um maior investimento no Serviço Nacional de Saúde para que o acesso ao aborto seja um direito efetivo.\n\nOs números dizem-nos que, em Portugal, o tempo médio de espera entre a consulta prévia e a realização da prática é de cinco dias e que das 40 unidades hospitalares com especialidade de Ginecologia e Obstetrícia preparadas para a IVG cerca de 30% não a realizam com recursos próprios. O boicote burocrático ao direito ao aborto passou a ocupar com regularidade as manchetes nos últimos meses e tornou visível que a objeção de consciência é um impedimento real ao cumprimento da lei. Contudo, reorganizar os serviços não resolve o problema, porque a declaração de objeção de consciência por profissionais de saúde não tem de ser informada previamente. A solução tem de ser outra.\n\nO enquadramento da lei não nos serve: impõe um limite gestacional do passado, as dez semanas, que é desadequado e curto, se comparado com as legislações da maioria dos países europeus, que o situam nas 12 semanas. Observando este quadro, e enfrentando as pessoas grávidas sucessivos reencaminhamentos quando se dirigem aos serviços de saúde indicados, abortar em Portugal tornou-se um jogo de sorte.\n\nO boicote burocrático ao direito ao aborto passou a ocupar com regularidade as manchetes nos últimos meses e tornou visível que a objeção de consciência é um impedimento real ao cumprimento da lei\n\nNum país democrático, o acesso a um direito não pode, sob nenhum pretexto, ser um jogo de sorte, recusamos esse desfecho e exigimos ao Estado português: alargar o prazo de limite gestacional para as 12 semanas; o fim do período de reflexão obrigatório; o fim da obrigação da intervenção de dois médicos/as para a realização da IVG; alargar a prática da IVG médica aos cuidados de saúde primários; assegurar que a objeção de consciência não constitua um entrave ao cumprimento da lei; investir na Saúde Sexual e Reprodutiva em contextos de formação e sensibilização da sociedade e de profissionais de saúde.\n\nBateram à porta.

Quem o diz é Rita Sá Machado, a diretora-geral da saúde, que considera que as pessoas estão “cansadas”.\n\n“Esta época notamos uma diminuição da cobertura vacinal da covid-19 na ordem dos 10%. Significa que as pessoas estão cansadas, o que na nossa gíria chamamos de 'fadiga de intervenção'”, reconheceu a diretora-geral da saúde. Na CNN Summit desta quinta-feira, que teve lugar no Centro Cultural de Belém, a responsável disse que a diminuição é “significativa”.\n\nQuanto a uma maior adesão à vacina contra a gripe, Rita Sá Machado admite, no entanto, que também “não é bem assim”. A diretora-geral da saúde explica que os focos de gripe A, que levaram a uma grande pressão nas urgências, com um elevado número de mortes, tinham por base “um vírus que não era mais forte”.\n\n“O que causou esta situação foi a população vir de três anos de pandemia, em que estivemos mais resguardados. Mostra que as pessoas confiaram e bem nas autoridades de saúde, que vocacionaram como mensagem para estarem mais resguardados nos próximos convívios, na utilização de máscara e sobretudo na vacinação”, relembrou, mencionando a “bastante elevada” cobertura vacinal tanto para a covid-19 como para a gripe durante esses anos.\n\nO próximo passo, que até já foi dado, como conta, passa por perceber o que originou a menor adesão à vacina, perceber “se existiu uma hesitação vacinal” e “preparar o próximo inverno”, para o qual fica a promessa da Direção-Geral da Saúde (DGS) “agir de forma diferente”.\n\nOutro tipo de vacinação foi também tema na conferência sobre a saúde e o ambiente: a vacinação contra o sarampo, doença que Rita Sá Machado afirma ainda existir em Portugal, devido aos “casos importados”. “Nós mantemos uma boa cobertura vacinal contra o sarampo. Denotamos é que existe um atraso. Em vez de virem quando completam um ano de idade, vêm um mês ou seis meses depois e isso pode ter impacto”, alertou.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 0, "end": 71}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 400, "end": 669}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1133, "end": 1149}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 1219, "end": 1460}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1219, "end": 1305}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1263, "end": 1305}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1453, "end": 1644}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1670, "end": 1869}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1939, "end": 2083}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2006, "end": 2013}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 2087, "end": 2345}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 2459, "end": 2584}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2505, "end": 2512}], "article_id": "4319", "lang": "pt", "text": "Rússia acusada de tentar minar apoio político a Kyiv com reuniões na ONU\n\nNuma reunião do Conselho de Segurança na tarde de hoje, o coordenador político do Reino Unido na ONU, Fergus Eckersley, assinalou que se trata da sétima vez este ano que a Rússia convoca uma reunião do Conselho sobre o fornecimento de armas ocidentais à Ucrânia, convidando novamente um orador ocidental para apoiar Moscovo.\n\n\"É óbvio o que a Rússia está a tentar fazer.

Na minha posição, lembro-me de Gramsci: o socialismo também é um projeto moral.\n\nA esquerda parece perdida em termos de uma posição coerente sobre a guerra na Ucrânia. A esquerda social-democrata europeia alinha claramente com a NATO e a esquerda radical mostra alguma ambiguidade. A meu ver, o que tem faltado é a análise da guerra em termos sistémicos e do seu significado no processo histórico e quanto aos interesses das massas populares. Não é a primeira vez que tal acontece. Entre outras causas, foi determinante para a cisão da II Internacional a posição em relação à Grande Guerra de 1914, em que a corrente que depois deu o movimento comunista considerava que a guerra não interessava aos trabalhadores nem os devia envolver, sendo um conflito entre potências imperialistas dentro do quadro das contradições do sistema capitalista.\n\nEstá a passar-se o mesmo. Todo o mundo político reage em termos geopolíticos, polarizados, com simpatias a prevalecer sobre a análise. É claro que a análise demonstrará que essas simpatias têm por fundo posicionamentos muito diferentes em relação ao conflito principal que deve mover a esquerda.\n\nNão sou um analista frio e também tenho simpatia, mas não por nenhum dos contendores, sacos da mesma farinha. A minha simpatia é com o povo ucraniano e com os soldados de um e outro lado que estão a ser carne para canhão.\n\nNa Guerra Fria havia alguma tendência para o relativismo na apreciação das atuações políticas concretas, conforme o nosso lado. Mas os lados eram essencialmente antagónicos, de sistema social e económico. Hoje não. Tal como em 1914, os antagonistas exprimem interesses imperialistas dentro do mesmo sistema. É certo que há diferenças de grau nos imperialismos e que, da parte russa, há fundamentos menos ligados ao domínio económico e mais ao nacionalismo grão-russo, à cultura e até ao papel da Igreja ortodoxa. Há também um peso maior da questão do Estado e o domínio não parece projetar-se à distância e com horizontes planetários, como no caso dos EUA. Mas, em rigor, não deixa de ser imperialismo, sensu lato, mesmo que seja um “imperialismo secundário”.\n\nNão sou defensor da perspetiva absoluta de real politik e não aceito que os fins justificam os meios. Custou caro à humanidade alcançar um sistema mínimo de ordenamento internacional, depois da II Guerra, que, por muitos defeitos que tenha, dá por adquiridos princípios de convivência entre Estados e povos. Referi-me ao relativismo na Guerra Fria, entendendo-o, mas não o aceitando hoje, à luz do direito internacional. Não posso condenar a invasão do Iraque e não condenar a invasão da Ucrânia. Na minha posição, lembro-me de Gramsci: o socialismo também é um projeto moral.\n\nIsto não quer dizer que, no plano da análise racional, não perceba todos os fatores que precipitaram a ação russa e que da sua compreensão não se retirem ensinamentos para a construção urgente de uma nova ordem mundial, contra a unipolaridade do domínio agressivo americano/NATO, cujas provocações também são absolutamente condenáveis. Por analogia jurídica, a provocação pode constituir uma atenuante para a invasão mas não anula a culpa.\n\nQuem percorre as redes sociais vê que há uma tendência flagrante em parte da gente de esquerda radical para uma atitude russófila. Nalguns casos, pode haver um certo saudosismo, um sentido de orfandade, que ainda veja na Rússia atual o esteio que era a URSS. Em geral, creio que a principal motivação é outra, apenas o contraponto com a oposição ao imperialismo americano, o expoente do capitalismo. Partilhando essa oposição, não alinho com a reação simplista e com muito maniqueismo de simpatia apologética para com o atual regime russo. O inimigo do meu inimigo não é forçosamente meu amigo.\n\nQuem percorre as redes sociais vê que há uma tendência flagrante em parte da gente de esquerda radical para uma atitude russófila\n\nA ação da esquerda consequentemente anticapitalista é o combate pelo socialismo, não é a participação, ativa ou afetiva, num ou no outro dos campos que manifestam contradições do sistema mas que se movem ambos nesse mesmo sistema único. É certo que aprofundar as brechas do sistema e usar as suas crises também a nível geopolítico, como esta atual, tem utilidade tática, mas não pode obscurecer o essencial. Essencial, neste momento, para os povos de todo o mundo e para a construção de um novo sistema de ordenamento internacional, é a paz e o levantamento de um forte movimento de pressão para um cessar-fogo imediato. As condições virão na fase de negociação.\n\nEssencial, para os povos de todo o mundo e para a construção de um novo sistema de ordenamento internacional, é a paz e a pressão para um cessar-fogo imediato\n\nProvavelmente, o momento atual, em que parece haver um certo impasse no campo militar, será uma oportunidade para a desescalada da guerra, no caminho da paz, e a abrir perspetivas de uma nova ordem mundial, com respeito pela soberania integral e segurança de todos os povos.\n\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 160, "end": 283}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 448, "end": 567}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 852, "end": 1053}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 915, "end": 1053}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 2772, "end": 2921}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2772, "end": 3117}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 3134, "end": 3254}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 3493, "end": 3600}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3714, "end": 3732}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 3735, "end": 3778}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 3802, "end": 3917}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 3920, "end": 3990}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 3920, "end": 3990}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 4022, "end": 4215}], "article_id": "4320", "lang": "pt", "text": "Vagas de calor na Europa e Estados Unidos seriam menos prováveis sem alterações climáticas, conclui estudo\n\nUm estudo, divulgado esta terça-feira, concluiu que sem as alterações climáticas, as atuais vagas de calor na Europa e nos Estados Unidos teriam sido “praticamente impossíveis”.\n\nMais de 50 graus no Vale da Morte, nos Estados Unidos, um recorde histórico de 45,3°C na Catalunha [Espanha], mais de 43°C em Phoenix [EUA] nos últimos 24 dias: sem as alterações climáticas, estas vagas de calor teriam sido “praticamente impossíveis” na Europa e nos Estados Unidos, indicou a rede científica World Weather Attribution (WWA).\n\nA WWA, que avalia a relação entre os fenómenos meteorológicos extremos e as alterações climáticas, considerou igualmente que as alterações climáticas tornaram a vaga de calor na China “pelo menos 50 vezes mais provável”.\n\nEstas ondas de calor “já não são acontecimentos excecionais” e as que ocorrem “serão ainda mais intensas e mais frequentes se as emissões [de gases com efeito de estufa] não forem reduzidas rapidamente”, concluíram os investigadores.\n\nEmbora fenómenos naturais, como os anticiclones e o ‘El Niño’, possam contribuir para desencadear estas ondas de calor, a subida “das temperaturas globais devido à queima de combustíveis fósseis é a principal razão pela qual são tão graves“, sublinhou a WWA.\n\nPara chegar a estas conclusões, os autores do estudo – sete cientistas dos Países Baixos, do Reino Unido e dos Estados Unidos – utilizaram dados meteorológicos históricos e modelos climáticos para comparar o clima atual e o aquecimento global de 1,2 graus com o que era no passado.\n\nEstes resultados foram publicados sem passar pelo longo processo de uma revisão por pares, mas combinam métodos já aprovados pelos pares.\n\nOs cientistas prestaram especial atenção aos períodos em que o calor foi “mais perigoso”, ou seja, de 12 a 18 de julho no sul da Europa, de 1 a 18 de julho no oeste dos Estados Unidos, Texas e norte do México, e de 5 a 18 de julho no centro e leste da China.\n\nOs responsáveis salientaram que o aquecimento global está a agravar a intensidade das temperaturas: com o aquecimento global, as ondas de calor na Europa são 2,5°C mais quentes, as da América do Norte são 2°C mais quentes e as da China são 1°C mais quentes, indicou a WWA.\n\nDe acordo com a NASA e o observatório europeu Copernicus, este mês “deverá tornar-se no julho mais quente de que há registo”.\n\n“No passado, estes acontecimentos teriam sido aberrantes. Mas, no clima atual, podem ocorrer aproximadamente de 15 em 15 anos na América do Norte, de 10 em 10 anos no sul da Europa e de cinco em cinco anos na China“, explicou Mariam Zachariah, cientista do Imperial College de Londres, que contribuiu para o estudo, num briefing telefónico.\n\nEstas ondas de calor “tornar-se-ão ainda mais frequentes e ocorrerão de dois em dois ou de cinco em cinco anos” se o aquecimento global atingir os 2ºC, “o que poderá acontecer dentro de cerca de 30 anos, a menos que todos os países signatários do Acordo de Paris implementem plenamente os atuais compromissos para reduzir rapidamente as emissões”, acrescentou.\n\nEste início de verão “pode tornar-se a norma (…) e até ser considerado fresco se não atingirmos a neutralidade carbónica”, sublinhou a climatologista britânica Friederike Otto.\n\nNa opinião de Otto, “os resultados deste estudo de atribuição não são uma surpresa.

Os rigorosos códigos de construção no país reflectem a ameaça de grandes terramotos. Mas os incêndios, que normalmente não constituem tanto perigo nesta parte do mundo, estão a revelar-se um novo desafio assustador e mortal na era das alterações climáticas.\n\nQuando as chamas destruíram uma cidade e mataram 11 pessoas em 2017, “toda a gente pensou que se tratava de uma situação muito especial e única”, disse Francisco de la Barrera, investigador da Universidade de Concepción. Depois, em 2023, os incêndios queimaram mais de um milhão de hectares e mataram duas dúzias de pessoas.\n\nActualmente, o Chile enfrenta o incêndio mais mortífero de sempre: pelo menos 112 pessoas morreram quando os incêndios destruíram comunidades isoladas nas montanhas e atingiram áreas densamente povoadas na região de Valparaíso, no centro do Chile, a noroeste da capital, Santiago. Tal como a grande maioria dos incêndios na América do Sul, o incêndio foi provavelmente provocado por seres humanos, mas o calor e a seca provocados pelas alterações climáticas permitiram que as chamas se propagassem a uma velocidade impressionante.\n\nNos últimos dias, as chamas propagaram-se em cerca de 100 incêndios diferentes, enquanto as temperaturas subiam persistentemente até bem acima dos 30 graus Celsius, um calor sem precedentes para o país costeiro, que provocou ventos quentes e secos que desciam as encostas íngremes. As temperaturas recordes também contribuíram para uma temporada de incêndios excepcionalmente activa em todo o Norte da América do Sul neste Verão.\n\nTanto na América do Sul como no resto do mundo, o aquecimento global está a aumentar a capacidade dos incêndios atravessarem paisagens ressequidas e surpreender comunidades não habituadas às chamas, impotentes para as combater. Os megaincêndios, outrora considerados uma anomalia, estão a tornar-se mais comuns e mortais à medida que a seca persiste e o calor se intensifica, sublinhando a necessidade de adaptação — mas também a futilidade de tentar impedi-los num clima alterado.\n\n“Os efeitos do aquecimento global sobre o clima já não podem ser ignorados”, disse Raúl Cordero, um cientista climático da Universidade de Groningen, nos Países Baixos, que esteve anteriormente no Chile.\n\nO deflagrar de incêndios tem sido comum no Chile durante episódios do padrão climático El Niño — que tem estado agora a aproximar-se de uma intensidade dramática nos últimos meses — incluindo em 1982 e 1998, afirmou Cordero. Mas nunca se espalharam tão ferozmente como desde 2017, quando o aquecimento acelerou os incêndios na sequência de um El Niño histórico. É por isso que o último incêndio foi tão mortal, considera — muitos residentes ignoraram os alertas de telemóvel com ordem de retirada, porque não conseguiam imaginar as chamas a galgar em direcção às suas casas tão rapidamente.\n\n“O que é novo aqui é o aquecimento global”, disse Cordero.\n\nCrise climática agrava ameaças\n\nForam necessários anos para que surgisse o cenário ideal para estes incêndios no Chile, mas agora os efeitos destes incêndios são inegáveis.\n\nO país está a meio de uma seca que dura há décadas, a pior da região num milénio, que também foi acentuada pelas alterações climáticas, disse Wenju Cai, um investigador principal da Organização de Investigação Científica e Industrial da Commonwealth da Austrália.\n\nA precipitação que no passado sustentava o país está a mudar-se para sul à medida que o aquecimento global altera os padrões meteorológicos, disse Cai. Quando os rios atmosféricos provocam fortes precipitações, é difícil que a água penetre no solo seco. Esta tendência está a exacerbar as flutuações naturais que, no passado, contribuíram para épocas de incêndios menos intensas durante os meses de Verão do Hemisfério Sul.\n\nDurante o Inverno mais recente do Hemisfério Sul, o El Niño alimentou as chuvas que criaram inundações e permitiu que a vegetação crescesse antes de as ondas de calor sem precedentes a transformarem em lenha para os incêndios. Entretanto, as temperaturas de Inverno atingiram os 38 graus Celsius em vastas áreas da América do Sul, em ondas de calor que, segundo os cientistas, provavelmente não teriam ocorrido se não fossem as alterações climáticas.\n\nAgora, durante a última semana, o Chile foi alvo de altas temperaturas, num calor de Verão sem precedentes. Uma estação meteorológica na região de Valparaíso registou temperaturas que chegaram aos 36 graus Celsius, enquanto os incêndios se propagavam na sexta-feira e no sábado. A região de Santiago teve cinco dias consecutivos de calor em torno dos 35 graus Celsius durante aquela que foi a semana mais quente já registada na região central do Chile, disse Cordero.\n\nAs tendências de longo prazo dão a entender que as condições se tornarão mais propícias aos megafogos, sem que se vislumbre o fim da seca de longo prazo e com um clima cada vez mais quente, fortalecendo os ventos para atiçar as chamas, disse Wenju. “O Chile não tem nada a ganhar”, disse.\n\nChile está a preparar-se para mais incêndios\n\nEmbora o país tenha tomado algumas medidas drásticas para enfrentar os riscos de incêndio, ainda não está preparado para eles, em comparação com outros lugares como o Sul da Califórnia, disse Cordero. Lá, os ventos de Santa Ana (ventos fortes e secos que afectam a Califórnia) comportam-se da mesma forma que aquilo a que muitos chilenos chamam ventos Puelche, aquecendo e secando rapidamente à medida que descem as encostas íngremes.\n\nMas, ao contrário do Oeste americano, onde os moradores cansados das ameaças de incêndio têm tomado mais medidas para se protegerem a si e às suas casas, pouco está a ser feito no Chile para preparar as paisagens para a ameaça de incêndios. A grande maioria é provocada pelos humanos, disse Francisco de la Barrera.\n\nAs florestas plantadas para a exploração madeireira e a produção de papel são dominadas por espécies não-nativas inflamáveis e que se estendem por hectares ininterruptos, sem os aceiros e outras precauções que poderiam impedir a propagação de megafogos cada vez mais comuns, explicou. Essas plantações foram um factor importante na temporada de incêndios de 2023 no Chile, disse Cordero.\n\nNos últimos anos, o Chile fez fortes investimentos em recursos humanos, equipamentos e tecnologia de combate a incêndios, com o presidente Gabriel Boric a aumentar os gastos em 47% em menos de dois anos no cargo, informou a Agence France Press (AFP). Mas Dolors Armenteras, professora da Universidade Nacional da Colômbia, disse que até mesmo isso está a ser insuficiente para esta nova realidade de incêndios da América do Sul. “Ainda não somos capazes de parar esses incêndios”, afirmou. “Vamos ter megafogos de novo. Esperemos que não haja gigafogos.”\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 3503, "end": 3684}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 4025, "end": 4110}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 4595, "end": 4675}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 6416, "end": 6532}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6493, "end": 6510}], "article_id": "4322", "lang": "pt", "text": "Legislativas 2024: o que dizem as últimas sondagens?\n\nO primeiro-ministro demitiu-se na senda da operação influencer e o Presidente da República optou por antecipar as eleições legislativas para 10 de março.

Chega garante maioria à direita\n\nO PS continua a liderar as intenções de voto (com 32,7%), mas a vantagem para a AD é, agora menor, em comparação com o estudo de opinião da Aximage para o DN, JN e TSF referente ao mês de dezembro. O projeto político de Luís Montenegro sobe ligeiramente (para os 27,4%), ainda a cinco pontos percentuais dos socialistas. O Chega mantém-se num patamar (16,6%) que garante maioria de um bloco de direita. Destaque, também, para o Bloco de Esquerda que sobe para os 8%, consolidando a 4.ª posição.\n\nPS continua à frente. Chega aproxima-se da AD de Luís Montenegro\n\nO PS continua a liderar a preferência dos eleitores portugueses (com 26,4%), segundo a sondagem da Intercampus para o JN e o Correio da Manhã. A Aliança Democrática (AD) não vai além dos 20,8%, somando menos preferências do que o PSD alcançou (22,5%), sozinho, no barómetro de dezembro. O Chega aproxima-se do segundo lugar, com 16,6% das intenções de voto. Com a Iniciativa Liberal a crescer ligeiramente (5,4%), os dados apontam para uma maioria de votos da direita (42,8%), embora para governar teria de se contar com o apoio do Chega.\n\nSocialistas nove pontos à frente dos sociais democratas\n\nO PS começa o ano com uma nova liderança e motivos para sorrir a olhar para as sondagens: os socialistas aumentaram a distância (agora avaliada em nove pontos percentuais) para o PSD, que cai. Apesar disto, a direita toda junta ainda vale mais do que a esquerda, mas a diferença está dentro da margem de erro. A CDU continua muito para baixo nas intenções de voto, no entanto, o PAN pode ser suficiente para contribuir para uma nova versão da “geringonça” que permita à esquerda governar.\n\nPS de Pedro Nuno Santos segue na dianteira\n\nOs socialistas e os sociais democratas cresceram face ao último barómetro da Intercampus, com os primeiros a liderar as intenções de voto e já com Pedro Nuno Santos à frente do PS. Todos os outros partidos descem neste inquérito, que revela ainda que 40% dos 611 inquiridos estão indecisos. Sublinhe-se que as respostas foram recolhidas antes do anúncio da Aliança Democrática (coligação que junta PSD e CDS) e que de acordo com estes dados a direita continua a precisar do Chega para atingir a maioria.\n\nPS à frente por pouco, independentemente do substituto de Costa\n\nJosé Luís Carneiro consegue mais um ponto percentual para o PS que Pedro Nuno Santos, mas, independente do vencedor, os socialistas permanecem na frente da corrida eleitoral de março, mesmo que por uma margem muito curta em relação ao PSD. Todavia, é à direita que continua a estar a maioria parlamentar, segundo este inquérito.\n\nPS a vencer, mas a maioria parlamentar está à direita\n\nSocialistas apresentam-se em crescimento, nesta sondagem da Aximage para o DN, JN e TSF, que coloca o bloco central em crescimento face a outubro (o último estudo de opinião da mesma empresa). Além do Chega, que aqui surge com mais do dobro das intenções de voto do BE, o quarto o partido. Já depois de instalada a crise política, este é o melhor resultado alcançado pelo PS (ainda sem liderança) durante o ano, nos inquéritos da Aximage.\n\nCentro em crise, Chega sobe\n\nSe as eleições legislativas fossem no próximo domingo… a possibilidade do PS ou do PSD vencerem seriam equivalentes (a diferença de um ponto percentual encontra-se na margem de erro). No entanto, os dois partidos apresentam uma queda muito significativa face à última sondagem realizada pelo Centro de Estudos e Sondagens de Opinião (Cesop) da Universidade Católica Portuguesa para a RTP, Público e Antena 1, em julho, que colocava o PSD com 33% e o PS com 32%.\n\nEm sentido contrário, o Chega é o partido que mais cresce. Se em julho, apresentava 10% das intenções de voto, agora sobe seis pontos percentuais.\n\nPS lidera intenções de voto e aumenta distância do PSD\n\nNa véspera do 41.º Congresso do PSD, o partido de Luís Montenegro aumenta a distância do PS, à frente nas intenções de voto, em relação ao barómetro mensal da Intercampus. Os dois partidos estão agora separados 1,7 pontos percentuais. Todavia, são os bloquistas quem mais cresce neste estudo (+ 2,8%) e o Chega (+1,8%), consolidando o quarto e o terceiro lugar respetivamente. A IL subiu 0,1% e é a CDU que mais cai (0,9%).\n\nPedro Nuno Santos ou José Luís Carneiro? Qualquer um leva a melhor sob Montengero\n\nEntre Pedro Nuno Santos e José Luís Carneiro, os portugueses preferem o primeiro, de acordo com um estudo da Intercampus, que atribui ao ex-ministro das Infraestruturas 35,9% na corrida para primeiro-ministro e 34,2% ao ministro da Administração Interna. Contudo, qualquer um dos dois candidatos à liderança socialista (que se disputa a 15 e 16 de dezembro) recolhe mais simpatia dos eleitores que o presidente do PSD, Luís Montenegro (30,7%).\n\nPS cai, mas continua à frente\n\nÀ tangente (e dentro da margem de erro), mas os socialistas continuam à frente nas intenções de voto, neste inquérito de opinião realizado pela Aximage para a TVI e CNN, já depois da crise política ter estalado. Das 504 respostas recolhidas, mais de um quarto (26%) considera votar nos socialistas, independentemente, da liderança ser de Pedro Nuno Santos ou de José Luís Carneiro. Enquanto isso, os sociais democratas apresentam dificuldade em capitalizar com a crise política, ficando mesmo atrás do resultado atingido nas legislativas de 2022 (27,67%).\n\nO Chega cresce dez pontos percentuais em relação às últimas legislativas, consolidando o lugar de terceira força política. E os bloquistas e os liberais também têm motivos para sorrir ao olhar para este estudo, em que surgem, respetivamente, com 8% e 6%. Já a CDU mostra-se em sentido descendente, com 3% – menos 1,3 pontos percentuais do resultado que obteve em 2022.\n\nPSD ultrapassa PS, no rescaldo da demissão de Costa\n\n24 horas depois de António Costa se ter demitido, os inquiridos pelo barómetro da Intercampus colocaram os sociais democratas como vencedores das próximas eleições, com 21,8% das intenções de voto. Já o PS recebeu 17,9%, quando no mesmo inquérito no mês anterior surgia com 25,2%.\n\nO principal beneficiário da crise política é o Chega, que se assume como uma peça indispensável numa união de direita e passa de 11,7% (em outubro) para 13% agora.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 0, "end": 71}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 74, "end": 293}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 296, "end": 495}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 297, "end": 318}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 311, "end": 318}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 338, "end": 346}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 349, "end": 369}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 894, "end": 977}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1089, "end": 1125}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1494, "end": 1515}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1854, "end": 1948}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1903, "end": 1918}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 1978, "end": 1987}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 2071, "end": 2132}], "article_id": "4323", "lang": "pt", "text": "Hamas alerta que nenhum refém sairá \"vivo\" sem \"respostas às exigências\"\n\nO Hamas alertou hoje que nenhum dos reféns, sequestrados durante o ataque em Israel em 7 de outubro e ainda detidos na Faixa de Gaza, sairá \"vivo\" sem negociações e sem \"respostas às exigências\" do movimento palestiniano. \"Nem o inimigo fascista e a sua liderança arrogante, nem os seus apoiantes, serão capazes de recuperar vivos os seus prisioneiros sem troca e negociação, e sem satisfazer as exigências da resistência\", afirmou Abou Obeida, porta-voz das Brigadas al-Qassam, o braço armado do movimento islâmico palestiniano, num vídeo hoje divulgado.\n\nUma semana de tréguas no final de novembro permitiu a libertação de 105 reféns detidos na Faixa de Gaza, incluindo 80 reféns israelitas trocados por 240 palestinianos detidos em prisões israelitas.\n\nO Qatar, que fez a mediação entre o Hamas e Israel, indicou que continuam em curso esforços para se alcançar uma nova trégua e libertar novos reféns, ao mesmo tempo que sublinhou que a ofensiva israelita na Faixa de Gaza \"estreitou a perspetiva\" de sucesso.\n\nIsrael - que nunca publicou uma lista - indicou que 137 reféns continuam detidos na Faixa de Gaza, onde o seu exército lidera uma ofensiva total, marcada em particular por bombardeamentos intensivos - do ar, do mar, do céu - contra o território pequeno e superpovoado, governado pelo Hamas desde 2007.

Apesar de no nosso país a vigilância ser insuficiente (sem qualquer referência à importância do rastreio das águas residuais...), os dados disponibilizados pela DGS/Instituto Ricardo Jorge mostram um cenário em que a gripe (predominantemente, o vírus H1N1 pdm09) é a principal responsável por idas aos centros de saúde e internamentos, quer em enfermaria, quer em cuidados intensivos (UCI). Aliás, em UCI atingiram-se 17,1% de internamentos por gripe, que é o valor mais alto dos últimos dez anos. Por outro lado, dados de vida real em Portugal (experiência do autor) parecem sugerir que a vacina antigripal desta temporada não reduz tanto a gravidade da doença, mesmo em indivíduos saudáveis...\n\nOra qual será a causa? Será falta de eficácia da vacina criada nesta temporada? Menor cobertura vacinal da população? Ou será que o vírus circulante apresenta novas variações genéticas que o tornam mais agressivo? Ou será, ainda, que, para além do hiato (“gap”) imunitário (originado pela redução da propagação de outros patógenos durante o encerramento de escolas e obrigatoriedade de uso de máscara) na pandemia, haverá um “roubo” imunitário atribuível ao SARS-CoV-2?\n\nEstimativas provisórias de eficácia das vacinas contra a influenza do Hemisfério Sul em 2023 na prevenção de hospitalizações associadas à infecção apontam para uma redução do risco de hospitalizações associadas à gripe em 52% (Rede REVELAC-i). Contudo estes resultados, costumam variar ao longo da temporada gripal e a eficácia da vacina pode descer entretanto... Por isso, uma verdadeira estimativa da eficácia das vacinas só se consegue... a posteriori.\n\nPor outro lado, evidência publicada nos EUA mostra que, embora as temporadas gripais com o vírus influenza A H3N2 estejam tipicamente associadas a mais hospitalizações em geral, a gravidade hospitalar foi maior em indivíduos infectados com vírus influenza A H1N1pdm09 ou influenza B, em comparação com o vírus influenza A H3N2.\n\nRecentemente, foi descrito que isolados virais A(H1N1)pdm09 derivados de casos fatais manifestaram alterações genéticas nas proteínas PB2 e PA (que são subunidades da RNA polimerase viral) com mais frequência do que aqueles derivados de casos leves.\n\nEm Portugal, dados da DGS até 3/1/2024 mostram que as coberturas vacinais contra a covid-19 e contra a gripe, nos grupos etários com 60 ou mais anos, corresponderam a 53% e 62%, respetivamente (atingindo no Norte quase 70% para a gripe e 55% para a covid). Dados do Vacinómetro® (sondagem telefónica de 4011 pessoas) de 5/12/2023, mostram que 73,4% dos indivíduos de mais de 65 anos já se encontram vacinados, o que já se aproxima mais dos objetivos europeus que propõem mais de 75% de cobertura vacinal para a gripe.\n\nOra, a vacina utilizada em Portugal inclui o vírus A (H1N1)pdm09 (subclade 5a.2a.1); será ele ligeiramente diferente ao que se encontra em circulação? Dados do Observatório europeu (ECDC - Centro Europeu de Prevenção e Controlo das Doenças) sugerem que durante a 40.ª semana de 2023 e a 1.ª semana de 2024, dos 234 vírus A(H1)pdm09 identificados na Europa, 90 foram relatados como pertencendo à clade 5a.2a e 144 foram subclade 5a.2a.1 (isto é, coincidindo com a vacina).\n\nOutra possível explicação para o aumento da suscetibilidade às infeções é o chamado “roubo” imunitário que se refere à noção de que o próprio SARS-CoV-2 rouba a imunidade, deixando algumas pessoas que tiveram covid-19 mais suscetíveis a outras infeções. Estudos científicos têm demonstrado que o vírus SARS-CoV-2, ao contrário do vírus da gripe, tem uma capacidade de destruir linfócitos T e “baralhar” a imunidade.\n\nPortanto, estes efeitos específicos do vírus da covid-19 sugerem que deveremos continuar a proteger as nossas populações desta ameaça! De tal forma que as instituições de saúde do Canadá já estão a programar um reforço vacinal contra o SARS-CoV-2 para os maiores de 65 anos, os residentes em lares e os imunocomprometidos, na Primavera de 2024.\n\nQue outras recomendações se poderá seguir?\n\nÉ sabido que existem vacinas antigripais de alta dose (que foram administradas aos idosos residentes em lares em Portugal) e que parecem proteger mais as pessoas de mais de 65 anos, com sistemas imunitários mais debilitados. Estas poderão ser recomendadas para aumentar a eficácia vacinal noutros grupos populacionais.\n\nSerá boa ideia alargar a cobertura vacinal para grupos mais jovens? Esta ação foi recentemente tomada pela DGS que alargou vacinação antigripal gratuita também para os maiores de 50 anos. Esta medida, para além de proteger este grupo etário que também tem tido aumento da mortalidade, ao alargar a cobertura vacinal a mais pessoas poderá reduzir o impacto da infeção na população em geral.\n\nÉ claro que a última pandemia foi a covid-19, mas não podemos esquecer que a gripe ainda é uma ameaça. E, assim, as autoridades de saúde pública em Portugal deveriam ter aumentado a comunicação nesta temporada, promovendo a confiança na vacinação e as medidas não farmacológicas tão propaladas durante a pandemia.

Por isso mesmo é também daqueles que mais tem contribuído para a NATO, tendo um dos maiores exércitos em termos de proporções, mas nunca chegará para defender o país de uma potência como a Rússia.\n\nO problema é, Segundo Veiko-Vello Palm, que muitos outros países também não têm essa capacidade. “Nos últimos deixámos muito, muito claro que, como uma aliança militar, muitos países da

alterações climáticas desmascarados\n\nA desinformação sobre o clima está em todo o lado. Este guia ajuda-nos a reconhecer e refutar os principais mitos e repor a verdade. Os cientistas não estão de acordo? O clima está sempre a mudar?\n\nOs cientistas de todo o mundo concordam que as alterações climáticas são reais, estão a acontecer agora e são causadas pela queima de combustíveis fósseis. No entanto, há muitos mitos que persistem sobre as alterações climáticas.\n\nA maioria dos mitos sobre as alterações climáticas tem sido perpetuada pelas empresas de combustíveis fósseis, pelos seus aliados políticos e por outros com interesses no status quo. Durante décadas, gastaram milhões de dólares em publicidade, \"estudos\" de grupos de reflexão e lobbies para confundir o público, os decisores políticos e também a imprensa e, assim, impedir a acção climática.\n\nIsto levou alguns jornalistas a suavizar a sua cobertura - por exemplo, não relacionando as alterações climáticas com condições meteorológicas extremas - deixando o público mal informado. Este guia ajuda a reconhecer e saber como refutar estes mitos.\n\nMITO 1: Os cientistas não estão de acordo sobre as alterações climáticas\n\nFACTO: Mais de 99% dos cientistas do clima concordam que a actividade humana está a sobreaquecer o planeta.\n\nEXPLICAÇÃO: Poucas ou nenhumas questões científicas foram tão estudadas e debatidas como as alterações climáticas. O consenso científico é esmagador e duradouro. Kate Marvel, uma cientista climática da agência espacial norte-americana (NASA, na sigla em inglês), afirma: \"Estamos mais certos de que os gases com efeito de estufa estão a causar as alterações climáticas do que estamos certos de que fumar causa cancro.\" Os cientistas concordam, na sua esmagadora maioria, que a queima de petróleo, carvão e gás está a sobreaquecer o planeta. O consenso científico é peremptório quanto ao facto de a queima de combustíveis fósseis estar a fazer subir perigosamente o termómetro global.\n\nMITO 2: As alterações climáticas são um embuste político\n\nFACTO: As leis da física não se importam com ideologias políticas. As alterações climáticas causadas pelo homem são um facto científico, como concluíram praticamente todas as instituições científicas do planeta.\n\nEXPLICAÇÃO: Os líderes políticos de todo o espectro ideológico, desde o autarca de Miami, Francis Suarez, à direita, até ao Senador dos Estados Unidos (EUA), Bernie Sanders, à esquerda, têm apoiado acções para evitar a catástrofe climática. Os governos nacionais, estaduais e locais de vários quadrantes políticos em todo o mundo estão a tomar essas medidas. O consenso científico é esmagador quanto ao facto de a queima de combustíveis fósseis estar a sobreaquecer perigosamente o planeta\n\nMITO 3: Não é possível saber que os seres humanos estão a causar alterações climáticas\n\nFACTO: Podemos, e sabemos. A temperatura global e os níveis de CO2 na atmosfera têm aumentado a par e passo desde que os seres humanos começaram a queimar grandes quantidades de carvão e outros combustíveis fósseis durante a Revolução Industrial. (Fonte: NASA)\n\nEXPLICAÇÃO: A NASA, a NOAA, o Serviço Meteorológico do Reino Unido, o Serviço Meteorológico do Japão e o Centro Europeu de Previsão do Tempo a Médio Prazo são apenas algumas das principais instituições científicas que compilaram estes registos de temperatura e CO2. Os cientistas sabem, sem qualquer margem para dúvida, através do estudo de dados antigos de temperatura e CO2, que a actividade humana é o motor das alterações climáticas.\n\nMITO 4: O clima está sempre a mudar, hoje não é diferente\n\nFACTO: É verdade que o clima da Terra já mudou antes. Mas nunca tão rapidamente como agora, devido aos 250 anos de queima de combustíveis fósseis.\n\nEXPLICAÇÃO: A actual taxa de libertação de carbono induzida pelo homem é \"sem precedentes nos últimos 66 milhões de anos\", segundo um estudo da revista científica Nature de 2016. Os cientistas concordam que o clima nunca mudou tão rapidamente na história da humanidade e que essas mudanças são o resultado da queima de combustíveis fósseis, o que ameaça seriamente o bem-estar humano.\n\nMITO 5: Não há nada que possamos fazer em relação às alterações climáticas, por isso, porquê darmo-nos ao trabalho\n\nFACTO: Os cientistas têm declarado repetidamente que a humanidade já dispõe das ferramentas e tecnologias necessárias para travar as alterações climáticas e evitar os seus piores impactos. O Relatório de Síntese do Painel Intergovernamental para as Alterações Climáticas (IPCC, na sigla em inglês) classifica as cinco abordagens principais que podem limitar o aumento da temperatura global a 1,5 graus Celsius.\n\nEXPLICAÇÃO: Os seres humanos vão ter de viver com as temperaturas mais quentes de hoje durante muitos anos, mas ainda podemos limitar drasticamente os danos futuros, se tomarmos medidas firmes agora. As soluções para o clima são abundantes, de senso comum e, muitas vezes, economicamente superiores às práticas actuais. Muitos governos e empresas já estão a implementar soluções de energia verde, trânsito de massas, resiliência costeira e agricultura inteligente em termos climáticos. O Projeto Drawdown também tem uma longa lista de soluções específicas para reduzir as emissões.\n\nMITO 6: Não podemos viver sem petróleo\n\nFACTO: As sociedades modernas não podem deixar o petróleo de um dia para o outro, mas a queda dos custos e a rápida expansão da energia solar, eólica e de outras fontes de energia renováveis mostram que podemos deixar os combustíveis fósseis para trás, se quisermos.\n\nEXPLICAÇÃO: A noção de que uma economia saudável e um ambiente saudável não podem andar juntos é um mito pernicioso que as empresas de combustíveis fósseis e outros interesses especiais há muito promovem. A economia actual ainda depende em grande parte do petróleo, mas em muitos casos, a energia solar e outras fontes de energia renováveis custam agora menos do que os combustíveis fósseis.\n\nMITO 7: E a China? Os outros países são piores\n\nFACTO: Os EUA emitiram mais gases com efeito de estufa do que qualquer outro país na história. A China ultrapassou recentemente os EUA como o maior emissor anual. Mas o que importa na atmosfera são as emissões cumulativas e não as anuais, o que torna os EUA os maiores responsáveis pelas alterações climáticas.\n\nEXPLICAÇÃO: As alterações climáticas são, por definição, um desafio global. Só pode ser enfrentado se todos os países, e especialmente os maiores emissores como os EUA e a China, eliminarem rapidamente os combustíveis fósseis. Embora as emissões anuais dos EUA tenham diminuído ligeiramente nos últimos anos, os EUA continuam a ser o maior poluidor climático da história, seguidos pela China.\n\nMITO 8: Um aumento da temperatura de 1,5 graus Celsius não é nada de especial\n\nFACTO: Actualmente, as temperaturas globais estão cerca de 1,2 graus Celsius acima dos níveis pré-industriais. Este aumento já intensificou as condições climatéricas extremas registadas em todo o mundo. Os impactos intensificar-se-ão quanto mais nos aproximarmos dos 1,5 graus Celsius.\n\nEXPLICAÇÃO: Uma diferença de temperatura de 1,2 graus Celsius não parece muito para o cidadão comum. Mas o sistema climático não funciona assim. Veja-se os impactos devastadores que já se fazem sentir em todo o mundo depois de \"apenas\" 1,2 graus Celsius de aumento da temperatura. Dois graus de aumento da temperatura podem parecer triviais, mas os cientistas afirmam que mesmo os actuais 1,2 graus Celsius de aumento estão a provocar o clima extremo que aflige agora grande parte do planeta.\n\nMITO 9: Os seres humanos, as plantas e os animais podem adaptar-se às alterações climáticas\n\nFACTO: A adaptação tem sido uma característica das espécies bem-sucedidas há centenas de milhões de anos. Mas há limites rigorosos quanto à rapidez - e à extensão - com que as pessoas, as plantas e os animais se podem adaptar.\n\nEXPLICAÇÃO: O rápido aumento das temperaturas actuais e a alteração dos padrões de precipitação já estão a dificultar a adaptação de muitas espécies. Um relatório de 2019 da Plataforma Intergovernamental Científica e Política sobre Biodiversidade e Serviços Ecossistémicos alertou para o facto de um milhão de espécies animais e vegetais estarem em risco de extinção, graças às alterações climáticas e à destruição de habitats. A adaptação é imperativa na era das alterações climáticas, mas só pode ajudar até certo ponto se não deixarmos de aquecer demasiado o planeta.\n\nMITO 10: Ninguém se preocupa com as alterações climáticas\n\nFACTO: As pessoas em todo o mundo estão cada vez mais preocupadas com as alterações climáticas e querem saber como as travar.\n\nEXPLICAÇÃO: O Programa de Comunicação sobre Mudanças Climáticas de Yale descobriu que 66% dos americanos estão \"um pouco preocupados\" ou \"muito preocupados\" com as mudanças climáticas. Um inquérito do Pew Research Center de 2021, realizado em 16 países, concluiu que 72% das pessoas estão \"um pouco\" ou \"muito\" preocupadas com a possibilidade de as alterações climáticas as prejudicarem pessoalmente.\n\nAlém disso, o Instituto Reuters para o Estudo do Jornalismo concluiu que a maioria das pessoas nos EUA - especialmente as pessoas com menos de 40 anos - quer mais notícias sobre a mudança do clima. Cada vez mais dados de inquéritos indicam que a maioria das pessoas se preocupa com as alterações climáticas e, sobretudo, quer saber como resolvê-las.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 19, "end": 252}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 93, "end": 140}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 176, "end": 184}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 209, "end": 223}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 805, "end": 992}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 805, "end": 992}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 996, "end": 1302}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1166, "end": 1211}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1314, "end": 1321}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1461, "end": 1686}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1476, "end": 1506}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1555, "end": 1561}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1586, "end": 1592}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1637, "end": 1658}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 1835, "end": 2018}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1854, "end": 2018}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 2152, "end": 2308}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2262, "end": 2282}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2312, "end": 2517}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2383, "end": 2397}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2470, "end": 2501}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2682, "end": 2856}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2741, "end": 2761}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2842, "end": 2856}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2859, "end": 3107}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3111, "end": 3391}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3347, "end": 3391}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3395, "end": 3601}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3421, "end": 3427}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3663, "end": 3820}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3872, "end": 3879}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 3895, "end": 3947}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4070, "end": 4216}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4127, "end": 4143}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4170, "end": 4173}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 4220, "end": 4575}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 4359, "end": 4376}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 4801, "end": 5881}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4884, "end": 4910}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 5484, "end": 5491}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 6019, "end": 6061}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 6047, "end": 6061}], "article_id": "4330", "lang": "pt", "text": "Pimenta na língua\n\nTivesse sido difundida com a intensidade com que são disseminadas algumas “notícias” com fundo de verdade deveras duvidoso e poderia ter sido uma verdadeira machadada nas teorias pilares da extrema-direita cá do burgo dos últimos anos.\n\nDe acordo com o Observatório das Migrações, em 2022, os imigrantes contribuíram com 1861 milhões de euros para a Segurança Social portuguesa, tendo apenas beneficiado de 257 milhões de euros, o que perfaz um saldo positivo de cerca de 1600 milhões de euros.\n\nFoi, segundo o observatório, o “valor mais elevado de sempre” de contribuições de imigrantes desde que há registo. Note-se ainda que os imigrantes constituem, atualmente, 7,5% do total da população nacional, mas as suas contribuições pesam 13,5% no total arrecadado pela Segurança Social.\n\nUm número que poderia ainda ser aumentado se todos estes imigrantes tivessem contratos de trabalho legalmente registados e as suas entidades patronais declarassem todos os seus rendimentos.\n\nServe esta pequena e simples análise a dados oficiais e concretos para desmentir algumas das teorias que têm sido bombardeadas pelas redes sociais, sob a forma de vídeos racistas, xenófobos e quase sempre manipulados e nas quais muitos cidadãos comuns, em situação de aperto financeiro, são tentados em cair.\n\nTeorias racistas nos meios de comunicação social mainstream\n\nUma dessas teorias, defendida em artigos de opinião que vão passando pelos pingos da chuva em alguns jornais mainstream supostamente isentos – como o “Observador” – e que, à boleia de uma suposta liberdade de expressão purista, permitem a publicação de qualquer tipo de verborreia intelectual sem questionar a sua origem, é a Teoria da Grande Substituição.\n\nEsta “teoria”, publicada em 2010 sob o título “Le Grand Remplacement” numa “obra” escrita pelo francês Renaud Camus, defende que existe uma conspiração de elites para substituir o poder político e a cultura da população branca nos países ocidentais por estrangeiros vindos de outros continentes.\n\nNa base desta teoria estão dados como a taxa de natalidade mais elevada da população imigrante, nomeadamente africana e asiática. Uma premissa também utilizada para atacar a comunidade judaica e que tornou Camus num ideólogo dos movimentos supremacistas brancos um pouco por todo o mundo.\n\nMarine Le Pen, Viktor Orbán e Donald Trump foram alguns dos líderes da extrema-direita mundial que recorreram à Teoria da Grande Substituição para justificar ataques às comunidades migrantes nos seus países, com base em que estaria em marcha um plano diabólico para a destruição da raça branca e pela sua substituição por migrantes dos continentes africano e asiático.\n\nA teoria também tem ganho adeptos por cá, incluindo alguns ilustres “opinadores” de jornais como o “Observador” e também políticos e defensores dos partidos de extrema-direita. De uma forma mais ou menos trauliteira, esta teoria é difundida via redes sociais, quase sempre através de perfis falsos, acompanhada por vídeos de locais onde há uma maior concentração de população migrante, como é o caso do Martim Moniz, em Lisboa.\n\nLocais onde, provavelmente, nunca nenhum deles foi, ou saberia, por exemplo, que o comércio em Lisboa, sobretudo a restauração, estaria moribundo na baixa da capital se não fosse esta comunidade imigrante, que trabalha de sol a sol por salários que os portugueses não querem ganhar.\n\nQualquer tipo de situação ilícita ocorrida com imigrantes é, de imediato, amplificado até à exaustão e respaldado nesta teoria, como forma de exemplificar que, como sempre defendem, eles é que “tinham razão”.\n\nÉ assim que funciona e tem tido cada vez mais eco e ganho adeptos que, à boleia de um contexto económico e social difícil, vão acreditando e contribuindo para propagar esta “verdade” pelos seus contatos mais próximos.\n\nSão os dados que destroem as teorias e os mitos racistas\n\nComo sempre, é difícil mostrar a quem não quer ver que está errado. Daí a importância da divulgação deste tipo de dados, de fontes oficiais e isentas, e que demonstram matematicamente que esse tipo de teorias são fantasias alimentadas por gente racista, xenófoba e que faz do discurso do ódio a sua principal arma de arremesso político.\n\nNão fosse a comunidade imigrante, sobretudo a que vem de países africanos, asiáticos, do Brasil e do leste europeu e a economia portuguesa estaria muito pior, com especial incidência em setores considerados chave para o modelo de desenvolvimento económico atual, como o turismo, a restauração, a construção civil, a agricultura e a logística e distribuição.\n\nAlém de contribuírem ativamente para o desenvolvimento da economia, sobretudo nos setores supracitados, ainda vêm alavancar o saldo da Segurança Social, contribuindo com muito mais do que aquilo que efetivamente recebem.\n\nE isto vivendo, muitas vezes, em situações sub-humanas, explorados por empresários sem escrúpulos e criminosos, como nas explorações agrícolas de Odemira, na apanha da ameijoa no Samouco, nas plataformas TVDE, na hotelaria ou na construção civil.\n\nPor outro lado, contribuem igualmente para o rejuvenescimento da demografia, uma vez que os casais portugueses têm cada vez menos filhos e a pirâmide etária teima em apresentar-se cada vez mais invertida.\n\nE, mesmo assim, são alvo de maus-tratos, discriminação, situações precárias de vida, salários miseráveis e à margem da lei, condições habitacionais desumanas e assédio no trabalho, moral e, muitas vezes, sexual.\n\nFora os ataques racistas que, volta e meia, provocam vítimas mortais, como o que se passou no passado dia 5 de dezembro, em Setúbal e que vitimou Gurpreet Singh, cidadão imigrante de nacionalidade indiana, que foi morto com um tiro de caçadeira no peito.\n\nO racismo e a xenofobia matam e é preciso desconstruir os mitos e falácias que são disseminados como baratas nas redes sociais e envenenam cada vez mais gente. E são números como os que aqui se trazem e que deveriam ser noticiados com a importância que realmente têm, o verdadeiro antídoto para desconstruir as mentiras da extrema-direita."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 21, "end": 68}], "article_id": "4331", "lang": "pt", "text": "Emigração de jovens: Paris já é chamada \"segunda capital de Portugal\"\n\nEm Paris, há quem diga, em tom de brincadeira, que a cidade é uma segunda capital de Portugal.

Ventura anuncia recandidatura à presidência do Chega\n\nO presidente do Chega, André Ventura, anunciou hoje a sua recandidatura à presidência do partido na Convenção do próximo fim de semana, apontando que tem como objetivo a vitória nas eleições legislativas de dia 10 de março.\n\n“Candidato-me a presidente do Chega com um objetivo ambicioso e difícil, mas claro: vencer as eleições legislativas de 2024”, afirmou André Ventura na sede do partido, em Lisboa, considerando que o trabalho que iniciou em 2019 “ainda não foi concluído”.\n\n“Esta Convenção ocorre no seguimento da decisão do Tribunal Constitucional, conhecida de todos, e em que se constatou a necessidade de uma reeleição dos órgãos nacionais”, acrescentou.\n\nO Tribunal Constitucional invalidou, no ano passado, a convocatória da V Convenção do Chega, que decorreu em Santarém entre 27 e 29 de janeiro de 2023 e, consequentemente, a aprovação do regulamento eleitoral e de funcionamento dessa reunião.\n\nAndré Ventura considerou que vencer as eleições legislativas de março será o caminho para “criar, alternativamente, uma maioria de direita no espetro parlamentar ao longo dos próximos anos”.\n\nO líder partidário considerou que terá também uma “ambição interna e de natureza estritamente política”, nomeadamente através da implementação do partido pelo território nacional em assembleias municipais, câmaras municipais e juntas de freguesia nas autárquicas de 2025.\n\nDe igual forma, salientou que pretende levar mais jovens para o partido – “não só para os órgãos do partido, como para o estabelecimento político nacional”.\n\nA VI Convenção do Chega vai decorrer nos dias 12, 13 e 14 de janeiro em Viana do Castelo e André Ventura espera apresentar “um programa ambicioso e completo” e que seja “uma alternativa à bipolarização PS e PSD”.\n\nNesse sentido, argumentou que o partido não poderá criticar os eleitores por escolherem os mesmos se não apresentarem uma “alternativa à altura”.\n\n“Não podemos criticar os portugueses por escolher os mesmos se não formos capazes de lhes darmos a alternativa à altura, com qualidade, com credibilidade e com prestígio, que é importante nos grandes e decisivos momentos da história”, afirmou.\n\nAndré Ventura critica discurso de Pedro Nuno Santos, que diz ter sido “o rosto da habitação”\n\nO presidente do Chega, André Ventura, criticou ainda o discurso do novo secretário-geral do PS, Pedro Nuno Santos, considerando que foi “o rosto da habitação do Governo durante os últimos anos”.\n\n“Se ele tivesse uma proposta, de facto, para ajudar a conter o valor das rendas ou para aumentar os apoios às rendas – que, aliás, estão atrasados –, ou para conter a crise da habitação, ou aumentar o parque habitacional público, então ele tê-lo-ia feito quando teve essa oportunidade, é que foi ministro que tutelou esta área”, afirmou.\n\nQuestionado sobre o congresso do Partido Socialista que se realizou entre sexta-feira e hoje, em Lisboa, o líder do Chega considerou que Pedro Nuno Santos se apresentou “como se não tivesse nada a ver com o partido e com o Governo em que esteve nos últimos anos”.\n\nNesse sentido, rejeitou as medidas apresentadas por Pedro Nuno Santos no discurso de encerramento do congresso socialista.\n\n“São meramente iniciativas programáticas e mostram uma grande falta de vergonha e de responsabilização face à participação que ele próprio teve no Governo socialista”, apontou.\n\nQuanto ao facto de o Chega não ter estado presente no congresso do PS, André Ventura considerou que a ausência de um convite mostra que o seu partido é o único que “coloca em causa os interesses instalados do Partido Socialista”.\n\nEm antevisão às eleições legislativas de 10 de março, André Ventura apontou que “se houver uma maioria de direita” nessa noite, o seu telefone “será para procurar garantir uma convergência e a possibilidade de formar um governo”.\n\n“O nosso grande objetivo tem de ser impedir o PS de governar”, insistiu André Ventura, que anunciou a sua recandidatura à liderança do partido na Convenção do próximo fim de semana.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language",

Por isso, justifica, este era um risco que \"o interesse público não aconselhava correr sem que se tivesse alternativas numa altura em que ainda era indispensável manter níveis elevados de testagem num período muito crítico da pandemia\".\n\nJá Lacerda Sales, que a sucedeu no cargo no final de 2020, justifica-se com a \"diferenciação de custos entre entidade públicas e entidades convencionadas\" e com a \"necessidade de analisar aquelas decisões de forma mais abrangente e integrada [...] do ponto de vista da estratégica global de combate à pandemia covid-19 e não isoladamente\".\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 125, "end": 137}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 305, "end": 375}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 468, "end": 643}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 969, "end": 1104}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1196, "end": 1236}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1240, "end": 1359}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1556, "end": 1579}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 2153, "end": 2186}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 2345, "end": 2433}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2372, "end": 2386}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2416, "end": 2423}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2474, "end": 2503}], "article_id": "4335", "lang": "pt", "text": "Ucrânia pede transferência de ativos russos congelados pelo Ocidente\n\nO pedido surge numa altura em que Kyiv, que enfrenta a invasão russa há dois anos, está preocupada com a erosão da assistência militar e financeira ocidental causada pela dissensão interna nos Estados Unidos e na União Europeia (UE).\n\n\"A ajuda dos nossos parceiros é um instrumento extremamente importante\", declarou Shmygal numa conferência de imprensa em Kyiv, citado pela agência francesa AFP.\n\n\"Mas precisamos de previsibilidade e de estabilidade, independentemente das condições climatéricas, das flutuações políticas e dos ciclos eleitorais que se desenrolam no mundo\", afirmou.\n\nShmygal disse que as dezenas de eleições previstas para este ano em países aliados da Ucrânia, incluindo os Estados Unidos, o principal apoiante de Kyiv, criam incerteza sobre a continuação da ajuda.\n\nTal situação \"representa um grande 'stress' para os nossos parceiros e para nós\", admitiu.\n\nShmygal referiu que \"o confisco dos bens russos deverá tornar-se uma fonte fiável de apoio\" ao Estado ucraniano e de financiamento à reconstrução da Ucrânia.\n\nA UE conseguiu desbloquear uma ajuda de 50 mil milhões de euros no início de fevereiro, após a criação de obstáculos pela Hungria.\n\nUm pacote de ajuda dos Estados Unidos está bloqueado há meses no Congresso pelos apoiantes de Donald Trump (republicano), apontado como favorito para as eleições presidenciais de novembro.\n\nO pacote norte-americano ascende a 60 mil milhões de dólares (55,5 mil milhões de euros, ao câmbio atual).\n\nDesde o início da invasão russa da Ucrânia, há dois anos, a União Europeia e os países do G7 congelaram cerca de 300 mil milhões de euros em ativos do Banco Central da Rússia, segundo a UE.\n\nA transferência desses ativos para a Ucrânia está longe de estar concluída devido, segundo o Ocidente, a obstáculos jurídicos e geopolíticos.\n\nOs europeus estão a preparar-se para transferir para Kyiv os juros e os lucros gerados pelos ativos russos.

A JN.1 deriva da Ómicron, uma das variantes do vírus, “e está a surgir em várias partes do mundo ao mesmo tempo, como nos EUA, na Europa, incluindo em Portugal, e na China”, o que se traduz numa “dinâmica nova”, explicou Tiago Correia esta quinta-feira, na antena da SIC Notícias.\n\n“Esta subvariante faz parte da Ómicron, que surgiu há cerca de dois anos. As demais subvariantes variam muito nas regiões do mundo em que surgem e esta está presente em várias ao mesmo tempo.

Sabíamos que seria endémico e que não havia forma de ser erradicado porque se iria propagar de uma forma mais rápida. Sabíamos que tinha esta capacidade evolutiva, os vírus adaptam-se aos seres humanos à medida que vão sendo transmitidos”, lembrou Tiago Correia.\n\nO especialista esclareceu ainda que “esta subvariante tem uma capacidade de fugir ao sistema imunitário, de infetar pessoas que já tiveram infeções por covid e infetar pessoas que tenham sido vacinadas há mais tempo”, mas destacou que nos países com uma menor taxa de vacinação há mais casos de hospitalização devido a infeções por coronavírus.\n\nA imunização é, por isso, crucial: “As pessoas não têm de desconfiar da vacina da covid-19, tal como não desconfiam de outras vacinas. O plano de vacinação tem de ser cumprido”.\n\n“As vacinas administradas no plano sazonal não são as vacinas que tomámos no início da pandemia.

Putin, ainda impregnado com a mentalidade belicosa de um KGB, não perde a esperança de que os Estados Unidos e a União Europeia, com o arrastar do conflito, acabarão por abandonar os ucranianos à sua sorte e Putin não quer, de maneira nenhuma, perder esta guerra – e com o conflito armado entre Israel e o Hamas que traz perturbação ao Médio Oriente, perfila-se o redesenhar de uma nova geopolítica com a probabilidade de virem a forjar-se novas alianças a nível mundial.\n\nNa verdade, a China, a Coreia do Norte e a Federação Russa são os países capazes de ameaçar o mundo livre e as democracias liberais. A China comunista- capitalista, liderada pelo autocrata tranquilo Xi Jinping e pelos sequazes que o seguem com fidelidade canina já está, desde há anos, inserida no mercado global tirando daí partido para estabelecer os negócios que lhe convém, ao mesmo tempo que não descura o investimento nas forças armadas pretendendo criar um exército ainda mais poderoso do que o exército dos Estados Unidos, com a finalidade de poder dissuadir qualquer veleidade de outros países (incluindo os Estados Unidos) que ousem fazer-lhe frente. A ilha de Taiwan já está na sua mira e a sua invasão efectuar-se-á quando a China achar mais oportuno. Como se verifica, desde há uns anos, milhares e milhares de chineses têm-se dispersado pelo mundo inteiro abrindo as suas lojas de pequeno, médio e grandes negócios, rivalizando com os comércios locais dos diversos países onde se espalham.\n\nPor sua vez, a Coreia do Norte, onde impera um regime tenebroso liderado pelo seu Querido Líder Kim Jong-un – senhor absoluto de tudo e de todos não dando hipótese à divergência, que, a existir, é contemplada com fuzilamento ou prisão perpétua – a Coreia do Norte, dizia eu, vive obcecada com a indústria militar e, a cada passo, realiza experiências com novas armas nucleares provocando a excitação orgiástica, o júbilo incontido de Kim Jong-un e dos seus velhos generais que não dispensam sorrisos e aplausos miudinhos, visivelmente encantados como crianças com os ensaios das novas armas. O êxtase do povo norte-coreano é atingido com os grandiosos desfiles militares onde é exibido toda a espécie de arsenal bélico de topo.\n\nRelativamente a Vladimir Putin, o ditador da Federação Russa, com a invasão levada a cabo na Ucrânia pretende destruir este país anexando-o e, se possível, prosseguir anexando ainda outros países que saíram da órbita de Moscovo após a queda do Muro de Berlim, em 9 de Novembro de 1989. Igualmente lhe convém desestabilizar a União Europeia tentando abrir fissuras e desentendimento quanto ao apoio incondicional dos seus membros à Ucrânia. Por sua vez, o presidente Zelensky da Ucrânia tem de contar com o fornecimento de material de guerra dos Estados Unidos e dos países mais desenvolvidos da União Europeia, sob pena, se fornecimento afrouxar, de a Ucrânia não sobreviver como nação independente se não aguentar a ofensiva russa. Se se vier a consumar a vitória da Ucrânia – o que se afigura difícil – o próximo passo será a sua integração na União Europeia, reforçando ainda mais esta união política e económica.\n\nComo análise concludente, tanto a China como a Federação Russa o que pretendem é enfraquecer a hegemonia dos Estados Unidos e da União Europeia. Quanto à Coreia do Norte convém que a China e a Rússia criem boas relações diplomáticas, políticas e militares com o país de Kim Jong-un para concretizar a estratégia que estará a ser gizada e que será o estabelecimento de uma Nova Ordem Mundial. Que não agradará à Europa e aos Estados Unidos.\n\n2 – A guerra na Ucrânia tem o “mérito” de demonstrar que os europeus se estão esquecendo que, infelizmente, do ponto de vista histórico, a guerra é norma e a paz a excepção. A piorar a situação do mundo actual, certas democracias, que afirmam respeitar o direito internacional e a integridade territorial dos países, negaram-se a condenar veementemente o novo imperialismo russo, que não deveria cobiçar e invadir um país soberano como a Ucrânia. Foi o caso do Brasil e da Índia a que se juntou a China que, como sabemos, não gosta de partidos políticos e não lhe agrada a democracia. O comunismo chinês é a “vanguarda” e a “verdade” e, por isso, não necessita de democracia.\n\nTodas estas ocorrências estão alterando a visão geopolítica que, como afirmou Guy Sorman, assentava na visão Oeste ou Ocidente (aliado com Estados Unidos) versus Leste europeu comunista e que, actualmente, com a batalha de Gaza está emergindo a oposição entre o Sul Global e o Norte Global (ex-Ocidente). Se o centro nevrálgico do Norte Global está situado em Washington, a União Europeia é a sua periferia. Por outro lado, poder-se-á afirmar que o Sul Global vai da China até ao Brasil passando pela África do Sul, Argélia e Venezuela, sendo tão heterogéneo que é difícil defini-lo do ponto de vista ideológico e geográfico.\n\nContudo, percepciona-se que o Sul Global é agora o nome aceite pelos países que se identificam com a desigualdade, mas desigualdades sempre existiram ao longo da história e, provavelmente, sempre existirão até à consumação dos séculos. O Sul Global define-se pela sua oposição aos Estados Unidos e ao Ocidente, designados o Norte Global. Ou seja, a ordem internacional ditada pelos Estados Unidos em 1945 já não é reconhecida pela maioria dos países que, de facto, foram colonizados pelo Norte, mas isso pertence ao passado.\n\nNo entanto, estes países estão convencidos que o Direito Internacional é uma nova forma de colonialismo que perpetua o poder branco e despreza as civilizações locais, sejam árabes, africanas, chinesas ou latino-americanas. O “wokismo” político e rácico não é alheio a este pensamento político. Não faltará, no entanto, quem vá admitindo que Pequim ou Moscovo pretendem dirigir o Sul Global, sendo mais provável que Pequim ganhe o despique sem prescindir da aliança com Moscovo. A partir de agora os Estados Unidos e a União Europeia terão de ter em conta esta realidade geopolítica.\n\nO mundo está a mudar e perspectivam-se dificuldades para o Velho Continente que deu novos mundos ao mundo com os descobrimentos marítimos e que beneficiou com esses descobrimentos. Se Donald Trump, um desequilibrado mentiroso, ganhar as próximas eleições para a presidência dos Estados Unidos, a Europa ressentir-se-á e deixará de se poder abrigar no guarda-chuva americano. O Norte Global enfrentará, por isso, novos, imprevisíveis e preocupantes desafios. O mundo está a mudar.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1382, "end": 1514}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1945, "end": 2047}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 2329, "end": 2506}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 2526, "end": 2689}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2736, "end": 2866}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 2736, "end": 2774}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2992, "end": 3070}], "article_id": "4340", "lang": "pt", "text": "Canadá: tradições de inverno alteradas por culpa das alterações climáticas\n\nÉ quase fim de janeiro, e os campos de hóquei não estão instalados no Parque Ignace-Bourget, em Montreal.

Se conseguíssemos eliminar completamente as nossas emissões (de gases de efeito estufa) e limitássemos o aquecimento a dois graus, a temporada seria encurtada entre 11 e 15 dias\", explicou.\n\n\"Mas, se continuarmos a queimar combustíveis fósseis dessa forma e não reduzirmos nossas emissões de CO2, poderemos ter estações de apenas 11 dias até ao final do século\", acrescentou o pesquisador.\n\nSegundo Dickau, 2023 é, \"definitivamente, uma anomalia\" e constitui um \"indicador da mudança climática, com o qual as pessoas se podem identificar\".\n\nPara resolver a situação, são desenvolvidas pistas de patinagem no gelo artificiais - menos de dez até agora em Montreal.

Rússia tenta limitar prática do aborto para inverter quebra de natalidade\n\nGrupos feministas russos têm vindo a denunciar a imposição de novas normas na Rússia que visam persuadir as mulheres a não realizarem abortos, à revelia do enquadramento legislativo que os autoriza\n\nDesde incentivos financeiros a grávidas até à escassez de medicamentos de interrupção da gravidez, passando pela pressão sobre as clínicas privadas para deixarem de realizar abortos, pela criminalização das tentativas de levar uma mulher a abortar e por indicações oficiais aos médicos para levarem raparigas e mulheres a mudar de ideias, o leque de estratégias recentemente adotadas em várias regiões russas contra o aborto tem vindo a alargar-se.\n\nO objetivo confesso das autoridades é aumentar a população do país, que praticamente estagnou nos últimos 20 anos. Há agora oficialmente 144 milhões de pessoas na Rússia, menos dois milhões do que em 2001, ano em que Vladimir Putin subiu ao poder.\n\nQuase um terço das mulheres russas reconhece ter feito pelo menos um aborto na sua vida. Em 2022, mais de 500 mil gravidezes foram terminadas, e somente 1.3 milhões de nascimentos foram registados no país.\n\nVladimir Putin considerou este um \"problema premente\".\n\nAs autoridades da Igreja Ortodoxa russa concordam e dizem que um fator chave para o agravamento da crise demográfica tem sido o elevado número de abortos. \"A população pode crescer como por artes mágicas: se resolvermos este problema e aprendermos a dissuadir mulheres de realizarem abortos, as estatísticas irão subir de imediato\", argumentou recentemente o patriarca Kirill.\n\n\"Enquanto membro do clero, testemunho que o aborto é um desastre e uma tragédia para a mulher e os mais próximos dela\", afirmou em janeiro de 2023.\n\n\"Precisamos de mais pessoas. É um facto óbvio, reconhecido por toda a gente, tanto políticos como sociólogos\", defendeu ainda o patriarca numa recente reunião eclesiástica. \"Mas para isso acontecer são necessários esforços reais\".\n\nUma panóplia de medidas\n\nUma das medidas concretas apadrinhadas pela Igreja tem sido a proibição de um \"incentivo ao aborto\". Kirill citou como exemplo a região da Mordovia, que impôs multas de até 200 mil rublos [cerca de 2.000 euros] a quem tente persuadir uma mulher a abortar. Tal medida devia alargar-se a todo o país, defendeu.\n\nAs autoridades estão a tentar também um reforço positivo através de incentivos financeiros às mulheres grávidas e às parturientes, incluindo o pagamento de quase 525 mil rublos [5450.963 euros] para comprar casa ou pagar a educação.\n\nParalelamente, as autoridades têm também limitado a venda de medicamentos usados para terminar uma gravidez, cujas vendas aumentaram 50 por cento só o ano passado. A partir de setembro de 2024, as farmácias serão obrigadas a registar a venda destes fármacos em bases de dados específicas.\n\nAs clínicas privadas têm também sido pressionadas a deixar de realizar interrupções de gravidez. Um quinto dos abortos na Rússia realiza-se nestes estabelecimentos. Igreja e os governadores de pelo menos 10 regiões russas têm adotado particularmente esta tática.\n\nA região anexada da Crimeia foi o primeiro território onde as clínicas privadas deixaram de realizar abortos, no início de novembro.\n\nDias depois, seguiu-se a região de Kursk, com quatro de cinco daqueles estabelecimentos deixaram de prestar aquele serviço. O seu vice-governador, Andrei Belostotsky, considerou a decisão um \"evento significativo\", uma vez que quase todas as mulheres que quiserem abortar terão de passar pelos hospitais públicos, onde as autoridades poderão \"trabalhar efetivamente com elas\" para tentar mudar-lhes a ideia.\n\nEssa tem sido a tática adotada pelo Ministério russo da Saúde. Impedido legalmente de proibir a interrupção de gravidezes, difundiu uma lista de atitudes a adotar pelos médicos para dissuadirem mulheres que as realizar.\n\nOs médicos estarão por exemplo a ser encorajados a dizer a mulheres grávidas adolescentes abaixo dos 18 anos que ser mãe jovem ajuda a criar laços com os filhos \"por serem praticamente da mesma geração\". E, se a mulher for solteira, deverão garantir que \"ter uma criança não será um obstáculo a encontrarem um companheiro\".\n\nIndignação feminista\n\nA restrição dos abortos em clínicas privadas em favor das intervenções em estabelecimentos estatais irá contudo prejudicar gravemente a saúde feminina, considerou contudo a especialista da Organização Mundial de Saúde, Lyubov Yerofeveya, à BBC Rússia.\n\n\"Isto vai ser um golpe contra os abortos médicos, porque este era o método promovido pela maioria das clínicas privadas. Mais de 80 por cento dos seus procedimentos eram médicos, ao passo que os hospitais estatais realizam sobretudo intervenções cirúrgicas\", acrescentou.\n\n\"Estas acarretam maiores riscos de complicações, efeitos secundários e lesões. É por isso que são cada vez menos praticadas\", explicou, receando que a repressão dos abortos legais leve a um aumento de intervenções ilegais de elevados risco.\n\n\"Estas iniciativas apenas irão levar a um aumento dramático no número de abortos ilegais e de mulheres russas mortas ou mutiladas\", argumentou igualmente à BBC o Movimento Feminista dos Urais, grupo que tem organizado pequenos protestos em defesa dos direitos ao aborto.\n\n\"Responsáveis oficiais, políticos de extrema-direita e a Igreja estão ativamente a forçar as mulheres e as raparigas a dar à luz crianças não desejadas\", denunciou ainda.\n\nAs mulheres podem não desejar os filhos mas o Estado precisa deles. As autoridades russas receiam por exemplo que a quebra no número de pessoas jovens, sobretudo de rapazes, torne mais difícil a recruta para as forças militares. O impacto da escassez de mão-de-obra merece igualmente atenção.\n\nPrioridades denunciadas pelas feministas, para quem os direitos das mulheres estão a ser atropelados em benefício dos militares e da economia. \"Precisam de novos contribuintes, precisam de novos soldados\", criticou Maria Mueller, da associação feminista russa Ona.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Doubt", "start": 181, "end": 303},

eliminaria os dados de localização das visitas a clínicas de abortos, mas também a centros de fertilização e instalações de reabilitação, locais considerados “pessoais” ou “sensíveis”.\n\nEsta decisão surgiu na sequência da decisão que revogou o direito constitucional à interrupção voluntária da gravidez (IVG) nos EUA, com a gigante tecnológica a mostrar-se preocupada com o facto de o rasto digital poder servir de prova de acusação, caso ocorresse um aborto em estados onde o procedimento foi proibido ou limitado.\n\nA empresa confirmou que, para os utilizadores que têm o histórico de localização ativo, esses locais seriam eliminados do histórico logo após a visita do utilizador. Contudo, um ano e meio depois desta decisão, um novo estudo concluiu que a Google ainda retém dados do histórico de localização em 50% dos casos.\n\n“Os dados de localização de um requerente de aborto ainda podem ser retidos e usados para processá-lo”, refere o estudo, acrescentando que a “Google ainda retém dados de consulta de pesquisa de localização e, provavelmente, outros dados incriminatórios”.\n\nApesar de não ter referido quando é que essa medida seria implementada, um estudo conduzido pelo grupo tecnológico Accountable Tech, cinco meses depois do anúncio, mostrou, de acordo com o The Guardian, que a Google ainda não tinha eliminado quaisquer dados relativos aos históricos de localização desses locais.\n\nNesta nova investigação, à qual o mesmo jornal teve acesso, a Accountable Tech descobriu, contudo, que embora a empresa ainda não tenha exlcluído o histórico de localização em todos os casos, tal como tinha prometido, a taxa de retenção do Google melhorou “ligeiramente”.\n\nEm comunicado, Marlo McGriff, gestor de produto da Google Maps, contestou as conclusões desta investigação, referindo que a marca “está a manter a promessa de eliminar locais particularmente pessoais do histórico de localização se esses locais forem identificados pelos sistemas”. “Qualquer afirmação de que não estamos a fazê-lo é totalmente falsa”, acrescentou.\n\nPara chegar a estas conclusões, a equipa realizou oito testes em sete estados norte-americanos – Pensilvânia, Texas, Nevada, Flórida, Nova York, Geórgia e Carolina do Norte – e, utilizando um dispositivo Android recente para se dirigir às clínicas de aborto, registou que dados de localização tinham sido armazenados.\n\nOs investigadores chegaram à conclusão de que, em quatro dos oito testes, o caminho para uma clínica de Planned Parenthood foi mantido no histórico de localização do dispositivo, embora o nome da clínica tenha sido apagado. Além disso, os dados sobre pesquisas de clínicas de aborto foram retidos na web e no histórico de atividade.\n\nA Accountable Tech refere ainda no estudo que a incapacidade de a Google cumprir metas antigas para proteger os utilizadores em relação a dados de localização mostra que a empresa “não é confiável para cumprir os seus compromissos públicos no prazo que promete”.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 53, "end": 61}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 259, "end": 302}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 385, "end": 468}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 452, "end": 468}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 574, "end": 641}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 605, "end": 613}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 632, "end": 641}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 671, "end": 774}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 778, "end": 922}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 982, "end": 1003}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1173, "end": 1181}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1515, "end": 1624}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1871, "end": 2008}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2475, "end": 2572}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2557, "end": 2572}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 2696, "end": 2717}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 3280, "end": 3352}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3335, "end": 3352}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3355, "end": 3402}], "article_id": "4347", "lang": "pt", "text": "Tribunal de Haia inicia audiências sobre acusação de genocídio em Gaza\n\nA África do Sul pediu aos juízes, no início da audiência, que impusessem ordens preliminares vinculativas a Israel, incluindo a suspensão imediata da campanha militar israelita em Gaza.\n\nIsrael rejeita as acusações da África do Sul.\n\nA presidente do TIJ, Joan E.

Guterres disse que \"nada pode justificar o assassinato, o ataque e o rapto deliberados de civis\", mas que isso \"não pode justificar a punição coletiva do povo palestiniano\".\n\nE aí começa a polémica...\n\nSim, porque o secretário-geral da ONU aludiu a \"violações claras do direito humanitário internacional\" na Faixa de Gaza, sublinhando que os ataques do Hamas não surgiram do nada, no quadro de 56 anos de uma \"ocupação sufocante\" - e aqui, uma vez mais, a expressão é de António Guterres e motivou, logo ali na hora, uma resposta enérgica por parte do ministro dos negócios estrangeiros israelita, que acusou Guterres de justificar o terrorismo do Hamas. Chegando, mesmo, a pedir a demissão de Guterres e a perguntar \"Em que mundo vive, senhor secretário-geral?\".\n\nComo é que o mundo tem reagido?\n\nComeçamos pelos Estados Unidos, que é um dos principais atores internacionais.\n\nO secretário de Estado, Anthony Blinken, insiste que \"o Hamas não representa o povo palestiniano\" e lembra que \"os civis palestinianos não são culpados pelos atos de terrorismo do Hamas\".\n\nMas há outras vozes que alinham com a indignação expressa por Israel: por exemplo, Itália e Reino Unido desafiam António Guterres a retratar-se destas declarações que classificam como \"inaceitáveis\".\n\nJá Espanha mostrou-se solidária com o secretário-geral da ONU. Pedro Sanchez referiu que Guterres levantou a voz \"por uma grande maioria das sociedades do mundo que querem uma pausa humanitária\" no conflito do Médio Oriente.\n\nE Portugal?\n\nDiz que Guterres foi \"cristalino na análise\". É a posição expressa pelo Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros que considera que \"não há forma nenhuma de dizer que António Guterres está a desculpabilizar o terrorismo\".\n\nAqui uma resposta muito clara a Israel. O gabinete do ministro Gomes Cravinho diz que isso \"é um erro absoluto e que não se pode deixar passar em branco\".\n\nE o próprio Guterres, como reage a tudo isto?\n\nEm choque. O secretário-geral das Nações Unidas lamenta o que diz ser uma deturpação das suas declarações.\n\nEsta é a primeira vez que o conflito israelo-palestiniano motiva uma polémica deste género?\n\nNão. Aliás, a tensão dos últimos dias já aconteceu no passado entre o Estado israelita e outros secretários-gerais da ONU que expressaram preocupação. Por exemplo, em finais dos anos 90, o secretário-geral Boutros-Ghali insurgiu-se contra a deportação de cidadãos palestinianos.\n\nMais recentemente, Ban Ki Moon, antecessor de Guterres na ONU, nunca se absteve de criticar a ocupação."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 0, "end": 54}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 57, "end": 111}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 258, "end": 367}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1094, "end": 1171}], "article_id": "4349", "lang": "pt", "text": "\"É fundamental que haja eleições Regionais antecipadas\"\n\n\"É fundamental que haja eleições Regionais antecipadas\", exige Paulo Cafôfo, presidente e cabeça de lista do PS-M às eleições Legislativas antecipadas pelo Círculo da Madeira.\n\nO candidato reforça que é também \"fundamental\" que o Presidente da República decida já a convocação de eleições antecipadas na Madeira.\n\nDeclarações esta manhã à chegada ao Tribunal do Funchal/Palácio da Justiça, para a entrega das listas da candidatura do PS à Assembleia da República pelo Círculo da Madeira.\n\nEncabeçada por Paulo Cafôfo, que é também o presidente do PS-M, a lista socialista madeirense ao Parlamento Nacional deposita grande esperança em ‘reeleger’ três deputados a Lisboa.\n\nO prazo para a entrega das candidaturas às eleições Legislativas antecipadas marcadas para 10 de Março termina hoje.\n\nAmanhã será o sorteio das listas para lhes atribuir uma ordem nos boletins de voto e verifica, enquanto decorre, no prazo de dois dias, o processo de autenticidade dos documentos e a elegibilidade dos candidatos.\n\nSobre a República, assegurou que a futura governação do país com o PS é o garante de \"estabilidade e confiança\"."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 0, "end": 80}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 14, "end": 80}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 83, "end": 173}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 212, "end": 330}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 264, "end": 451}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 455, "end": 499}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 851, "end": 941}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 977, "end": 1153}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 1268, "end": 1495}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1862, "end": 1907}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1910, "end": 2037}], "article_id": "435", "lang": "pt", "text": "Marcelo apela ao respeito pelos direitos de todos os migrantes, sem discriminação\n\n“É inegável o potencial das migrações enquanto motor de desenvolvimento económico e social”, defende o Presidente da República.\n\nO Presidente da República apelou esta segunda-feira ao respeito pelos direitos de todos os migrantes, sem discriminação, tenha o seu movimento sido forçado, voluntário ou formalmente autorizado, afirmando que estão em causa direitos humanos.\n\n“Direitos dos migrantes são direitos humanos”, escreveu Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, numa mensagem publicada esta segunda-feira no site oficial da Presidência da República, para assinalar o Dia Internacional dos Migrantes.\n\nNesta nota, o chefe de Estado refere que há no mundo “mais de 280 milhões de migrantes, cidadãos em movimento procurando por oportunidades para uma vida melhor”, e defende que “é inegável o potencial das migrações enquanto motor de desenvolvimento económico e social”.

ISCTE para a SIC e Expresso que coloca a Aliança Democrática à frente do PS e o BE à frente da IL.\n\nNa primeira ação do dia de campanha para as eleições antecipadas de março, e apesar das perguntas sobre aquela sondagem, o dirigente liberal defendeu que as sondagens são informações e que o que importa à IL são as tendências.\n\n\"Eu estou muito confiante em que até dia 10 de março nós vamos ter uma onda liberal a formar-se no país e a dar testemunho da necessidade de transformação através da baixa de impostos e de medidas concretas na saúde, na habitação e para as famílias portuguesas\", argumentou.\n\nSegundo Rui Rocha, a tendência que a IL tem identificado no terreno, nomeadamente no contacto com as pessoas, é um crescimento da IL que se mantém, independentemente de cada sondagem.\n\nPor isso, nesta última semana de campanha, Rui Rocha disse que vai continuar a afirmar a mensagem da Iniciativa Liberal que passa, sobretudo, pela necessidade de mudar e transformar o país e pô-lo a crescer pela positiva.\n\nIL lamenta que ainda haja \"alguma resistência\" a um país de futuro\n\nRui Rocha considerou que \"ainda há alguma resistência\" a um país de futuro, após questionado sobre declarações do cabeça-de-lista da AD por Santarém, que afirmou que se perde investimento por \"falsas razões climáticas\".\n\n\"Queremos mudar para um país de futuro e é a Iniciativa Liberal que o traz porque, depois, algumas declarações que vamos vendo mostram como ainda há alguma resistência a esse futuro, daí ser tão importante que a Iniciativa Liberal seja o partido forte nas próximas eleições\", referiu Rui Rocha.\n\nEduardo Oliveira e Sousa, antigo presidente da Confederação dos Agricultores de Portugal (CAP), considerou que Portugal tem perdido investimento por \"falsas razões climáticas\" e avisou que há agricultores que já falam em organizar milícias armadas perante \"os roubos nos campos\".\n\nNa primeira ação de campanha eleitoral de hoje, o dirigente liberal salientou que declarações como aquelas que foram proferidas pelo cabeça de lista da AD por Santarém reforçam a convicção de que o voto na Iniciativa Liberal \"é o voto do futuro, um futuro numa agricultura de valor acrescentado, de precisão, de inovação e de tecnologia\".\n\nE acrescentou: \"É um voto de futuro no que diz respeito aos direitos que não são negociáveis das mulheres, é um voto de futuro do ponto de vista da transformação ao nível da fiscalidade das empresas, da saúde e da habitação\".\n\nDepois de percorrer os expositores na BTL representativos das várias regiões do país, o presidente da IL insistiu que com a IL não há regresso ao passado, mas sim \"velocidade para chegar a um futuro mais próspero\".\n\nRui Rocha pede aos indecisos para apanharem \"viagem a bordo da IL\"\n\nO presidente da IL apelou esta sexta-feira aos eleitores indecisos para apanharem \"uma viagem a bordo da IL\", argumentando que será \"para um futuro melhor\", durante numa visita à Bolsa de Turismo de Lisboa (BTL).\n\nAproveitando uma visita à BTL no âmbito da campanha eleitoral para as legislativas do dia 10, e entusiasmado com as várias propostas de viagens pelo país, Rui Rocha convidou os eleitores indecisos a apanharem uma \"viagem a bordo da IL\", prometendo que será \"repleta de intensidade\".\n\n\"É uma viagem para um futuro melhor e, portanto, é esse o bilhete que eu queria apresentar e desafiar os portugueses a usarem no próximo dia 10 de março\", apelou o dirigente liberal.\n\nDepois de provar diferentes iguarias, o presidente da IL insistiu que para dia 10 de março \"só há um bilhete e uma viagem que interessa\" que é o voto na IL.\n\nNum \"stand\" dedicado à ilha da Madeira, Rui Rocha concorreu para se habilitar a ganhar uma viagem àquela região autónoma e questionado para onde gostava de viajar, Rui Rocha disse apenas: \"Eu gostava de ganhar um bilhete para que Portugal se transforme num país diferente\".\n\nReforçando a mensagem da importância do voto na IL, Rui Rocha entendeu, contudo, que os eleitores precisam de tempo para avaliar as propostas dos partidos políticos, o que poderá justificar o elevado número de indecisos neste momento.\n\n\"Há muitas propostas e, portanto, os eleitores precisam também de tempo para avaliar e terão, seguramente, coisas que valorizam mais nuns partidos, coisas que valorizam menos\", afirmou.\n\nPor essa razão, defendeu, os partidos políticos devem apresentar as suas propostas e a dizerem claramente que país pretendem.\n\nRui Rocha considerou que o país \"não tem tempo\" para \"mais do mesmo\", para \"mais soluções de esquerda nem \"pode ter no governo\" quem \"não representa soluções e paralisa essas soluções\" como, afirmou, é o caso do Chega.\n"}, {"annotations":

agora, já percebeu o impacto das alterações climáticas?\n\n2023 foi um ano de calor recorde, tempestades e inundações devastadoras, secas cada vez mais profundas e incêndios florestais violentos: estes acontecimentos, indicou Albert van Dijk, mostraram como as alterações climáticas estão a afetar o ciclo global da água e os nossos meios de subsistência.\n\nSegundo o professor de Dinâmica da Água e da Paisagem, da ‘Fenner School of Environment & Society’, da Universidade Nacional da Austrália, os investigadores deixaram o alerta num relatório (‘Global Water Monitor’), que documentou o profundo impacto do calor recorde do ano transato no ciclo da água, como as secas mais rápidas e severas ou as tempestades e inundações mais intensas.\n\nDezenas de países registaram temperaturas médias anuais recorde em 2023 – as secas severas atingiram três continentes. As maiores florestas do mundo sofreram, com o Canadá a lutar contra enormes incêndios e a seca a atingir durante a Amazónia.\n\nO calor está a secar o mundo\n\nO sinal mais óbvio da crise climática são as ondas de calor sem precedentes que varreram o planeta em 2023 – o ano mais quente de que há registo deu-nos uma ideia de como pode ser um ano típico com 1,5°C de aquecimento. Em cerca de 77 países foi registada a temperatura média anual mais elevada em pelo menos 45 anos. Foram quebrados recordes de temperatura do Canadá ao Brasil, de Espanha à Tailândia.\n\nAs altas temperaturas eram frequentemente acompanhadas por uma humidade do ar muito baixa. A humidade relativa do ar na superfície terrestre global foi a segunda mais seca já registada em 2023.\n\nA rápida secagem das explorações agrícolas e das florestas provocou o fracasso das colheitas e incêndios devastadores. A falta de chuva e o aumento das temperaturas intensificaram secas plurianuais em regiões vulneráveis, como a América do Sul, o Corno de África e o Mediterrâneo.\n\nAs últimas duas décadas aumentaram significativamente a temperatura do ar e reduziram a humidade do ar. Esta tendência contínua para condições mais secas está a ameaçar a agricultura, a biodiversidade e a segurança hídrica em geral.\nEstas condições agravam o stress térmico e aumentam as necessidades de água das pessoas, das culturas e dos ecossistemas.\n\nMudanças no ciclo da água alimentam tempestades intensas\n\nUma mudança na circulação e na temperatura do mar no Oceano Pacífico devido às condições do ‘El Niño’ influenciou o ciclo global da água em 2023. E aconteceu num contexto de aumento da temperatura da superfície do mar devido ao aquecimento global.\n\nO aumento da superfície do mar e da temperatura do ar tem intensificado a força e a intensidade das chuvas de monções, ciclones e outros sistemas de tempestades.\n\nEm 2023, também foi possível verem-se ciclones a comportarem-se de forma inesperada e mortal – um ciclone atingiu a Nova Zelândia; o ciclone de maior duração alguma vez registado atingiu o sudeste de África durante semanas; por último, desenvolveu-se um ciclone no Mar Mediterrâneo, que atravessou a Grécia para destruir barragens na Líbia, matando milhares de pessoas. Os danos globais estimados causados pelos ciclones em 2023 ultrapassaram os 45 mil milhões de dólares.\n\nAs temperaturas mais altas do mar alimentam esses eventos estranhos. À medida que a crise climática se agrava, podemos esperar mais tempestades sem precedentes.\n\nE 2024, como será?\n\nNo início de 2024, o maior risco de desenvolvimento ou intensificação de secas surge na América Central e do Sul (exceto sul do Brasil e Uruguai), sul da África e oeste da Austrália.\n\nÉ pouco provável que as regiões que receberam muitas chuvas no final de 2023 desenvolvam secas durante pelo menos vários meses – estas incluem a região do Sahel e o Corno de África, o norte da Europa, a Índia, a China e o Sudeste Asiático.\nOs acontecimentos de 2023 mostram como a ameaça das alterações climáticas em curso para o nosso planeta e para as nossas vidas está a aumentar a cada ano. Globalmente, a frequência e a intensidade dos eventos de precipitação e inundações estão a aumentar. Ao mesmo tempo, há também secas em maior número e mais rápidas, ou secas repentinas, que podem causar quebras de colheitas e incêndios florestais destrutivos em semanas ou meses.\n\nCom o desafio alimentar global, a crise da biodiversidade e uma necessidade extremamente urgente de reduzir as emissões de carbono, estas secas e incêndios estão entre as nossas maiores ameaças globais.

É o caso de Leon Tolstoi (1828-1910), autor de “Guerra e Paz”, ou “Anna Karenina”, e que inspirou correntes filosóficas através da crítica ao patriotismo, às desigualdades sociais e à Igreja. A sua ideologia de não-resistência ao mal pela violência influenciou até mesmo Gandhi a desenvolver a doutrina da não-violência.\n\nMas também o poeta, dramaturgo e escritor do séc. XIX, Alexandre Pushkin, que deu o nome ao instituto de língua e cultura russa mais conhecido, o Instituto Pushkin. Ou Fiódor Dostoievski, escritor, jornalista e filósofo, que integra a época dourada da literatura russa. O autor de “Crime e Castigo” (1866), “O Idiota” (1869) e “Os irmãos Karamazov” (1880) foi contemporâneo de Nikolai Gogol e Tolstoi. Ou mesmo a Condessa de Ségur, nome artístico de Sophie Rostopchine, conhecida por escrever clássicos da literatura infanto-juvenil em francês. Com origem numa família nobre casou com um embaixador francês.\n\nE não nos esqueçamos de Piotr Tchaikovsky, compositor de “O Lago dos Cisnes” e “O Quebra-Nozes”, as maiores obras-primas do ballet clássico, de Olga Khokhlova, a influente bailarina que casou com Pablo Picasso, ou de Mstisláv Rostropóvitch, o maior violoncelista do século XX, aluno de Shostakovich e Prokofiev, e forçado ao exílio em 1970 por defender Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Tal como o compositor, maestro e pianista Igor Stravinsky, conhecido por obras notáveis como “O Pássaro de Fogo”, “Petrushk”a ou “O Rito da Primavera”.\n\nConsideremos ainda Andrei Sakharov, físico nuclear envolvido no desenvolvimento da primeira bomba de hidrogénio e que recebeu o Nobel da Paz em 1975 devido à luta pela defesa dos direitos humanos na URSS. O cientista inspirou a União Europeia a criar o Prémio Sakharov em 1988, atribuído desde então a organizações que se destacam na defesa dos direitos humanos. Contemos ainda com Mikhail Gorbatchov, o último presidente da URSS, que acabou com a Guerra Fria.\n\nEsta pequena amostra revela como é a alma do povo russo. A literatura esboçou a expressão “alma russa” (Русская душа) para se referir à espiritualidade do povo, ou melhor, a uma personalidade profunda e forte, constantemente ligada ao sofrimento, à tragédia e à resignação. Gogol, Tolstoi e Dostoievski usaram-na nos seus escritos. Segundo Dostoievski, que se inspirou no sofrimento de Cristo, sua humildade e entrega até à morte pela humanidade, a necessidade espiritual básica do povo russo é “o sofrimento, onipresente e insaciável, em todo o lugar e em tudo.” Esta é a perspectiva filosófica como os russos entendem a sua identidade colectiva, do ponto de vista religioso e simbólico e que também inclui elementos como a força e a compaixão.\n\nDaí Maiakovski ter escrito: “Não é difícil morrer nesta vida. Viver é muito mais difícil.” Talvez por isso o povo russo se tenha sempre sujeitado à ditadura, primeiros dos czares, depois a soviética e agora a putinista. Mas também consolidou a filosofia da alma russa em momentos de ruptura como a resistência a Napoleão na Campanha da Rússia, a Revolução Russa e a luta conta o nazismo.\n\nSegundo alguns observadores Aleksandr Dugin, o guru de Putin, dá ideia de “comandar tudo na Rússia”. Mas isso parece que não lhe chega. Em entrevista ao Expresso ele apresenta-se como estando a “servir a identidade, espírito e alma do meu povo.” Mas se assim fosse a alma russa teria a marca dos cultos satânicos e do nazismo, actividades em que Dugin se envolveu há mais de quarenta anos. Dugin consagra uma devoção idealista à Rússia czarista e estalinista, enquanto despreza os valores da democracia e dos direitos humanos, considerando-os como marcas exclusivas do Ocidente, enquanto defende pontos de vista fascistas e de extrema-direita.\n\nEm 2007 dizia que ninguém considerava existir alternativa política a Putin, a não ser pessoas mentalmente doentes e a necessitar de internamento psiquiátrico: “Putin está em toda parte, Putin é tudo, Putin é absoluto e Putin é indispensável.” Como se não bastasse ele integra o “partido da guerra”, defendeu a anexação da Crimeia e a invasão da Ucrânia afirmando que os russos só devem parar em Kiev.\n\nA verdade é que se Rasputin ocupa o rodapé da história pela influência maléfica que teve sobre o czar Nicolau II, sua família e indirectamente sobre a governação imperial e o povo russo, Dugin (apesar da barba mimética em relação a Rasputin) nem a isso terá direito apesar de se autocentrar e considerar de forma tão elevada. Este doutrinário do ocultismo arvorado em guru de Putin nunca será uma estrela, mas antes uma espécie de cometa que passa nos céus dos Urais de modo fortuito e fugaz para não mais alguém se lembrar dele. Afinal, a alma russa tem donos legítimos mas perdeu-se porque anda a ser vendida ao diabo.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 3046, "end": 3134}], "article_id": "4353", "lang": "pt", "text": "Como o vírus da Covid-19 faz refém a dopamina, hormona da felicidade\n\nUm novo estudo, desenvolvido por investigadores da Weill Cornell Medicine, da Universidade de Columbia, e do Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, em Nova Iorque, nos EUA, concluiu que pode haver um motivo biológico que justifique porque é que algumas pessoas ficaram mais tristes ou irritadas após recuperarem da Covid-19.\n\nDe acordo com a equipa, que realizou diferentes experiências laboratoriais utilizando células humanas, o SARS-CoV-2 pode infetar as células cerebrais responsáveis pelo humor, stress e movimento, impedindo o seu correto funcionamento.\n\nMais especificamente, os investigadores perceberam que o vírus da Covid-19 prejudica a produção de dopamina, também conhecida por hormona da felicidade, deteriorando as células ao ponto de elas não conseguirem crescer e dividir-se.\n\nEste neurotransmissor – substâncias químicas produzidas e libertadas principalmente no cérebro – induz os impulsos nervosos que nos oferecem informações ligadas à chamada via da recompensa, através da qual ganhamos consciência do que nos proporciona bem-estar, numa relação causa-efeito.\n\nAssociada a várias outras funções do corpo humano, tanto cognitivas como motoras, a dopamina tem sido bastante estudada, até porque a sua desregulação, seja por excesso ou por défice, é uma causa de doenças como esquizofrenia ou Parkinson e de problemas como a adição.\n\nAlém disso, é responsável pela regulação do sono, concentração, aprendizagem de movimentos e memória e, por isso mesmo, esta descoberta poderia ajudar a explicar por que motivo a Covid-19 provoca sintomas como confusão mental e tristeza.\n\n“Resultado completamente inesperado”\n\nA equipa do estudo, publicado na Cell Stem Cell, utilizou células-tronco para criar vários tipos de células encontradas no corpo humano, com o objetivo de perceber como o vírus da Covid-19 afetava cada uma delas.\n\nContudo, obteve um “resultado completamente inesperado”: a análise das células permitiu concluir que apenas os neurónios dopaminérgicos foram infetados pelo SARS-CoV-2, o que fez com que deixassem de funcionar e enviassem sinais químicos que causam inflamação.\n\nA equipa descreve que cerca de 5% dos neurónios dopaminérgicos podem ser infetados pelo vírus da Covid-19, o que conduz à senescência e à inflamação. “Este projeto começou com o objetivo de investigar como vários tipos de células em diferentes órgãos respondem à infeção por SARS-CoV-2. Testámos células pulmonares, células cardíacas, células beta pancreáticas, mas a via da senescência só é ativada em neurónios da dopamina”, reafirma Shuibing Chen, da Weill Cornell Medicine, e autor sénior da investigação.\n\nA senescência corresponde ao processo natural de envelhecimento a nível celular, em que existe uma deterioração gradual da função dos organismos vivos, o que resulta na incapacidade de as células saudáveis crescerem e dividirem-se.\n\n“A taxa de infeção dos neurónios da dopamina não é tão elevada como a das células pulmonares, o principal alvo do vírus, mas mesmo uma pequena população de células infetadas pode ter um efeito potencialmente grave”, esclarece ainda Chen.\n\nApesar dos resultados, os investigadores referem que nem todas as pessoas são suscetíveis de sofrer danos nos neurónios da dopamina, havendo uma série de fatores envolvidos no risco neurológico, incluindo a genética e a gravidade da doença, por exemplo.\n\nA equipa diz ainda que, devido ao facto de a senescência dos neurónios da dopamina ser uma caraterística comum da doença de Parkinson, é essencial que as pessoas que sofrem de Covid longa sejam acompanhadas com o objetivo de se conseguir detetar um possível risco acrescido de desenvolverem sintomas relacionados com esta condição.\n\nMedicamentos que podem ajudar\n\nApesar das conclusões do estudo, a equipa percebeu, também, que três medicamentos podem potencialmente proteger os neurónios da dopamina contra a infeção pelo vírus da Covid-19: o riluzol, um medicamento comum no tratamento da doença de Lou Gehrig, a metformina, utilizada para tratar a diabetes, e o imatinib, usado para o tratamento da leucemia e outros tipos de cancro.\n\nContudo, serão necessárias mais investigações que permitam testar efetivamente a eficácia destes medicamentos na proteção dos neurónios da dopamina.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1997, "end": 2167}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2115, "end": 2125}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 2171, "end": 2239}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 2171, "end": 2239}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2365, "end": 2402}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2602, "end": 2667}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2882, "end": 3344}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2921, "end": 2932}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2975, "end": 2994}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3235, "end": 3344}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3258, "end": 3276}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3324, "end": 3344}], "article_id": "4354", "lang": "pt", "text": "França: Assembleia Nacional aprova inclusão do aborto na Constituição\n\nPor 493 votos a favor e 30 contra, os deputados franceses aprovaram a inclusão na Constituição da \"liberdade garantida\" das mulheres poderem recorrer à interrupção voluntária da gravidez.\n\nOs deputados da Assembleia Nacional francesa aprovaram, esta terça-feira (30 de janeiro), a inclusão na Constituição da \"liberdade garantida\" das mulheres poderem recorrer à interrupção voluntária da gravidez (IVG).\n\nA inclusão das mulheres a abortar, impulsionada pela maioria simples de Emmanuel Macron e apoiada pela esquerda, foi aprovada por 493 votos a favor e 30 contra.

Desde pelo menos o final do século XIX, quando algumas fações do sionismo levantavam a hipótese de ser construído aquele que viria a ser o Estado de Israel. Depois da barbaridade com que o povo judeu foi confrontado, no pós-segunda guerra mundial, nasce uma nação em terra já habitada. Os problemas, desde cedo, pareceram evidentes. E as soluções, desde logo, foram profundamente ineficazes.\n\nGrandes líderes da geopolítica procuram ajudar. Os povos votaram e manifestaram a sua autodeterminação, que a ONU e as supremas autoridades internacionais fingiram respeitar. Na verdade, o conflito tornou-se palco de gestão de equilíbrios, com a fação ocidental a apoiar, na sua larga maioria, o poder bélico de Israel, e o mundo árabe a fomentar o extremismo religioso na nação palestiniana.\n\nSerá uma frase feita falar em problemas dos dois lados. Mas a verdade é que as frases são feitas por terem um propósito. E é evidente que existem problemas de parte a parte.\n\nA começar pela eleição de uma larga maioria de representantes políticos do Hamas, um assumido grupo de cariz paramilitar, que nunca se escusou a violentar os israelitas. Do outro lado da fronteira traçada de forma imaginária, está Benjamin Netanyahu, e o seu governo de ideologia neofascista, que assume um papel desestabilizador na Região, a fim de manter o seu cargo e a popularidade entre o seu povo.\n\nIsrael não é Netanyahu e a Palestina não é o Hamas.\n\nMas o que é certo é que é Israel que avança de forma medonha pela Faixa de Gaza e vai devastando uma sociedade de centenas de milhares de pessoas que ficaram subitamente e literalmente sem chão. É de Israel que partiu o mote de destruição total, chamando os palestinianos de animais e declamando que só parariam quando não houvesse mais nenhum para morrer. Não é dos israelitas, mas é do governo de Israel que chovem os misseis e marcham os tanques, apoiados de forma muito pouco secreta pelos poderes norte-americanos e europeus.\n\nAo contrário do que se passou com a condenação da Rússia, aquando da invasão à Ucrânia, assistimos a uma Europa que se intimida perante uma condenação efetiva do genocídio que decorre na Palestina. Que se intimida perante Netanyahu, o mesmo que não teve qualquer problema em cercar milhões de pessoas, deixando-as sem água, comida e energia, conseguindo, ainda, cortar-lhes as ligações ao mundo para, claramente impedir que a realidade pavorosa do que se está a passar, não fosse conhecido ou, pelo menos, minimizado.\n\nUma Europa que preferiu condenar as declarações pertinentes de António Guterres. Mas, afinal, que mentira disse ele? Podemos olhar o que se está a passar sem contextualizar historicamente? Foi exatamente a alienação global do que ali se passou durante décadas, que permitiu que a Palestina fosse sendo invadida e Gaza cercada. E foi essa falta de conhecimento que permite uma desinformação que corre o risco de se normalizar o genocídio que está em curso.\n\nO que se passa em Gaza, e se almeja levar a toda a Palestina, é a criação de um grande cemitério\n\nO que se passa em Gaza, e se almeja levar a toda a Palestina, é a criação de um grande cemitério. Onde adultos e idosos vão morrer. E onde as almas de milhares de crianças vão repousar. Ali não há lugar para nos escondermos da realidade. A morte partilha a casa connosco. E ninguém parece querer saber.\n\nÉ preciso não ter medo de condenar publicamente o que o governo de Netanyahu está a promover. É preciso saber dizer que a Palestina merece muito melhor do que o Hamas.

A 27 de Maio, participou no Fórum Social do Porto, onde governantes, parlamentares e parceiros sociais de vários países e instituições da União Europeia debateram o futuro do modelo social europeu. Segundo a governante, o Estado-providência da Ucrânia, severamente debilitado e desestruturado pela guerra, confronta-se hoje com a tarefa hercúlea de acudir aos 2,7 milhões de pessoas portadoras de deficiência que, com a agressão da Rússia, ficaram ao desamparo, incapazes de fugir, ou foram integradas em instituições sobrelotadas e sem funcionários. A ministra falou ainda de próteses. E não se referia a próteses dentárias. Ela tinha em mente os milhares de soldados ucranianos estropiados, amputados, brutalizados, traumatizados, e que, na sua recém-adquirida condição de pessoas física ou psicologicamente incapacitadas, têm o futuro comprometido. Culpas à parte, na Rússia, a desgraça é sem dúvida simétrica, pois outro tanto se pode dizer dos milhares de soldados russos descartados como carne num matadouro, mobilizados à força e deixados ao deus-dará. A estimativa dos mortos e feridos em combate dá calafrios. Fala-se em duzentas mil baixas do lado russo e em metade disso do lado ucraniano. Mais do que a soma das vítimas nas cidades de Hiroxima e Nagasaki, obliteradas pelo fogo termonuclear.\n\nEste panorama arrepiante traz à memória o epílogo dos conflitos que devastaram a juventude europeia na primeira metade do século passado, causados pela doença do nacionalismo, e que Wilfred Owen, um inglês que morreu na frente francesa, em 1918, durante a I Guerra Mundial, verteu numas quantas elegias avassaladoras, como aquela que fala do soldado sem pernas que “vai andar uns anos enfermo por hospícios,/cumprir normas, fazer tudo o que deve,/ receber compaixão em doses comedidas./ Reparou esta noite nos olhos das mulheres/ dele desviados para homens ainda inteiros” (tradução de João Almeida Flor).\n\nPutin ocupou-se nos últimos anos a fabricar uma mitologia da história russa à medida dos seus anelos de restauração imperial - uma fantasia mortífera. Para tal, tem recorrido a alocuções onde pontua um fatalismo de tipo messiânico, com apelos a uma “autopurificação”, aparições da alma russa e outros excursos metafísicos que reputávamos evacuados da geopolítica do nosso continente.\n\nAnton Tchekhov nasceu na Ucrânia, junto ao mar de Azov, e teve por avô um servo ucraniano que comprou a sua própria liberdade. Numa das cartas enviadas a Olga Knipper, sua esposa, o autor de As Três irmãs escreveu, em 1901, que “na Rússia não há quem não se vanglorie do seu passado. O presente é sempre menos bom que o passado. Porquê? Porque o temperamento exaltado dos russos tem isto de particular: cede rapidamente lugar à lassidão e ao tédio”, e, \"experimentando lassidão e tédio, o russo não compreende o que está a acontecer nem aquilo que se passou (…). Eu próprio não compreendo o que se passa na minha alma”. Terão os soldados russos enviados para o matadouro alguma compreensão do que está a acontecer? Não estarão, muitos deles, como essas rezes confusas, de órbitas arregaladas, que farejam a própria morte – e não compreendem?\n\nA verdade é que, para desilusão de uns poucos, a oposição dos europeus ao fatalismo nacionalista invocado por Putin e a empatia com a provação dos ucranianos revigorou o nosso sentimento de pertença a essa construção cultural e política a que chamamos Europa – e isso é adubo para a constituição de uma identidade europeia.\n\nMas não sabemos que Ucrânia vai emergir desta guerra; não sabemos se vai emergir, de todo; se haverá um país depois disto. Seria insensato descartar a possibilidade de a Ucrânia acabar subjugada pela Federação Russa. Nesse caso, que se faria do estatuto de candidato a membro do bloco europeu, recentemente obtido? Não passaria de um simulacro cruel e vazio. Terá mesmo a Ucrânia um lugar na União Europeia? Tê-lo-á conquistado à custa do próprio sangue? A razão e a emoção contendem. Lembrei-me de Hegel e do \"ardil da razão\": para avançar na História, para lograr a sua supremacia, a razão serve-se das paixões, cavalga-as – é esse o seu ardil. Perante o calvário da Ucrânia, talvez não devamos reprimir a vontade de agasalhá-la, um dia, no seio da União. É talvez a razão a fazer o seu trabalho ardiloso.\n\nMas que o lamento que nos merecem os soldados ucranianos seja compartilhado com os soldados russos. Afinal, como dizia Tchekhov, noutra carta, “a vida está-se nas tintas”. Mas a morte iguala uns e outros. O silêncio é o mesmo. O luto das mães é indivisível. É uno.

Este bispo palestiniano teme que sim\n\n“Depois desta guerra, temo que não haja mais cristãos em Gaza, após uma presença contínua de mais de 18 séculos.” A frase é um murro no estômago, e ganha ainda mais força por ser proferida a poucos dias da celebração do Natal, por um bispo nascido na Palestina, que atualmente está em Jerusalém e contacta diariamente com a paróquia da Sagrada Família, em Gaza. Mas William Shomali, 73 anos, bispo auxiliar do Patriarcado Latino de Jerusalém, que diz até acreditar em milagres, não consegue negar: deixou de acreditar que haja futuro para os cristãos naquela região.\n\n“Cerca de 60 já partiram, 20 foram mortos [desde o início da guerra]. Receio que os cristãos de Gaza, que sofreram mais do que em qualquer outra guerra anterior, possam abandonar definitivamente a região após o fim da guerra”, confessa Shomali numa entrevista à revista jesuíta America.\n\nE descreve a situação vivida com desolação: “Gaza hoje assemelha-se às cidades alemãs destruídas durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial, e muito mais. A maior parte da infraestrutura está danificada. Milhares de casas foram destruídas. Centenas de milhares de pessoas estão desabrigadas. Apenas 20 por cento da população tem acesso a água potável. As doenças estão a espalhar-se. Os hospitais precisam de combustível. O pânico e o medo prevalecem. O medo prevalece também nas cidades israelitas perto das fronteiras de Gaza. A maioria dos habitantes foi obrigada a abandonar as suas casas”.\n\nPreocupa-o particularmente a pequena comunidade católica da paróquia da Sagrada Família. “Entramos em contacto com eles todos os dias, quando é possível. Contam-nos sobre a sua vida diária e necessidades básicas. Neste momento, têm falta de combustível. Receamos que não consigam ter eletricidade suficiente para carregar os seus telefones. Sem telefone, qualquer contacto com eles será impossível no futuro”, diz o bispo palestiniano.\n\nAlguns doentes “correm o risco de não sobreviver muito tempo”\n\nE a situação piorou, de facto, no último fim de semana, já depois de o bispo Shomali ter falado à revista America, com os ataques que atingiram o complexo paroquial e provocaram a morte de Nahida Khalil Anton e da sua filha, Samar Kamal Anton, ambas pertencentes àquela que é a única paróquia católica em Gaza. Sete outros paroquianos ficaram feridos e a casa das Missionárias da Caridade foi danificada.\n\nO convento das irmãs abrigava mais de 54 pessoas com deficiência e tinha sido “designado como local de culto desde o início da guerra”, segundo o Patriarcado Latino. Todos os hóspedes da casa “estão ilesos e foram transferidos para outra área do complexo, mas as suas condições são muito precárias. Alguns deles, que necessitam de respiradores, correm o risco de não sobreviver por muito tempo”, alertou o pároco Gabriel Romanelli, em declarações à Catholic News Agency (CNA), esta quarta-feira. Até porque “o gerador do edifício e os recursos de combustível foram destruídos”.\n\nRomanelli disse à CNA que desde sábado não foram registados mais incidentes naquela zona, mas reconheceu que, após quase 80 dias de conflito, as pessoas estão “num ponto de rutura”. Os recursos são escassos e as dificuldades, bem como o medo e a tensão, estão a aumentar. Os painéis solares e os tanques de água foram destruídos, os alimentos foram racionados durante semanas e neste momento já não há água potável. O gasóleo do único gerador eléctrico em funcionamento da freguesia está esgotado. Entre as consequências mais graves da falta de eletricidade, está o não funcionamento de dispositivos médicos, incluindo os respiradores e os sistemas de purificação de água.\n\nAinda que com cada vez mais dificuldades, as comissões paroquiais organizadas para realizar tarefas e necessidades de sobrevivência prosseguem os seus trabalhos: algumas compram alimentos, outras cozinham, há quem trate da limpeza e quem cuide das crianças, um grupo prepara a igreja e gere os serviços litúrgicos, outro ainda centra-se na manutenção, e alguns estão a cuidar dos doentes, na medida do possível.\n\nA poucos dias do Natal, enquanto a possibilidade de um novo cessar-fogo não se confirma, os cristãos em Gaza “estão a preparar-se como os pastores de Belém”, conclui o padre Romanelli. No meio das dificuldades, as orações e liturgias na paróquia da Sagrada Família não param, garante. E deixa um pedido: “Rezemos pela paz, pela cura de todos, pela libertação dos reféns e para que o Natal traga um sopro de paz a toda a Terra Santa”."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 429, "end": 557}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 992, "end": 1075}], "article_id": "4359", "lang": "pt", "text": "Dois novos efeitos secundários muito raros ligados a vacina contra a Covid-19 identificados em grande estudo mundial\n\nUm grande estudo mundial, que incluiu mais de 99 milhões de pessoas de vários países do mundo e foi publicado na revista internacional Vaccine, identificou dois novos efeitos secundários, embora muito raros, de uma das vacinas contra a Covid-19: uma perturbação neurológica e uma inflamação da medula espinal.\n\nApesar disso, a equipa ressalva que os benefícios das vacinas contra a Covid-19 superam largamente os possíveis riscos associados. Os investigadores utilizaram dados anónimos da Global Vaccine Data Network, uma rede internacional de investigação que testa a eficácia e segurança das vacinas, para compararem a prevalência de 13 condições relativas ao cérebro, ao sangue e também cardíacas em pessoas que tinham recebido as vacinas contra a Covid-19 da Pfizer, Moderna ou AstraZeneca com a taxa que seria de esperar dessas doenças na população antes da pandemia.\n\nA partir desta análise, os cientistas tiraram com grande exatidão algumas conclusões: além de terem confirmado as ligações já conhecidas entre as vacinas de RNA mensageiro (mRNA), da Pfizer e Moderna, e os efeitos secundários raros de miocardite, inflamação do músculo cardíaco, frequentemente causada por infeções virais, e pericardite, inflamação da membrana que envolve o coração, o pericárdio, também confirmaram que a síndrome de Guillain-Barré, uma condição rara em que o sistema imunológico ataca os nervos periféricos, causando fraqueza muscular, por exemplo, é um efeito secundário raro associado à vacina da AstraZeneca.\n\nApesar disso, Jim Buttery, um dos diretores da Global Vaccine Data Network, afirma que o risco de miocardite é ainda maior com a infeção natural por Covid-19 do que após a vacinação contra o vírus.\n\nOutra ligação desta vacina confirmada pelos autores do estudo, ainda que rara, foi a existência de casos de trombose do seio venoso cerebral (um tipo de coágulo sanguíneo no cérebro).\n\nIdentificados dois novos efeitos secundários raros\n\nA partir da análise dos mesmos dados, relativos a pessoas da Austrália, Argentina, Canadá, Dinamarca, Finlândia, França, Nova Zelândia e Escócia, os investigadores identificaram um novo efeito secundário da vacina da AstraZeneca, que utiliza um adenovírus (um tipo de vírus) modificado, que não se replica no corpo humano, para transportar material genético que codifica a proteína spike do coronavírus SARS-CoV-2: a encefalomielite disseminada aguda (ADEM, na sigla inglesa).\n\nEsta é uma doença inflamatória do sistema nervoso central que afeta principalmente o cérebro e a medula espinal. Geralmente, é desencadeada por uma resposta imunológica anormal após infeções virais ou vacinação, levando a sintomas como febre, dor de cabeça, confusão mental e disfunção neurológica, e foi relacionada com a toma desta vacina pelos investigadores.\n\nEste resultado levou a equipa à realização de um segundo estudo, publicado na mesma revista, com o objetivo de testar de forma autónoma a existência deste efeito secundário. Para esta investigação, os investigadores analisaram um conjunto de dados separados de quase 7 milhões de australianos que tinham recebido a vacina da AstraZeneca.\n\nAlém deste efeito secundário raro, que foi confirmado pela equipa – 0,78 casos por cada milhão de doses – também foi identificado um novo efeito secundário raro, conhecido como mielite transversa (1,82 casos por milhão de doses para esta condição), uma condição médica em que ocorre inflamação na medula espinal, afetando as fibras nervosas e interrompendo as comunicações entre a medula espinhal e o resto do corpo.\n\nButtery explica ainda que “no caso dos efeitos secundários raros”, só é possível ter conhecimento deles “depois de a vacina ter sido utilizada em milhões de pessoas”, o que explica que estes efeitos da vacina contra a Covid-19 só estejam a ser identificados agora.\n"}, {"annotations": [], "article_id": "436", "lang": "pt", "text": "Covid longa.

O Texas, o estado com a maior fronteira com o México, tem-se chocado com o governo federal nas questões da fronteira e da imigração.\n\nCom os números de migrantes na fronteira sul em máximos desde 2000 — mais de 300 mil só em dezembro de 2023 –, é compreensível porque é que o Texas recebeu o apoio de 25 estados com governadores republicanos neste combate ao governo federal. Mas mesmo que o Texas considere esta vaga de migração uma invasão que lhe dá o direito a defender-se, a Constituição e a jurisprudência americanas discordam. Não se pode considerar migração invasão, e o controlo das fronteiras e das políticas migratórias é da responsabilidade única do governo federal.\n\nAcompanhando a tendência dos países ocidentais, a imigração líquida (incluindo legal e ilegal) nos Estados Unidos triplicou em 2023 face à média dos anos 2010, chegando aos 3,3 milhões, 1% da população americana. O número de pessoas detetadas na fronteira com o México também triplicou durante os anos Biden. Segundo o Pew Research Center, em 2021, os imigrantes ilegais eram cerca de 10,5 milhões, um número que até então estava a descer lentamente\n\nE quem é que, em 2016, com sucesso fez do combate à imigração ilegal a sua maior bandeira eleitoral? Está certo, Donald J. Trump, o republicano que seria eleito nesse ano. E agora, na sua tentativa de recuperar a Casa Branca, que perdeu em 2020, tem voltado a carregar no tema, desde afirmações fortes e polémicas como dizer que os imigrantes estão a “envenenar o sangue da nossa nação” e acusações ao presidente Joe Biden de que tem “ajudado e permitido uma massiva invasão” de migrantes. Por mais extremadas que estas declarações possam parecer, a verdade é que a questão da imigração preocupa cada vez mais os americanos e favorece Trump. Segundo uma sondagem da última semana da Harvard CAPS-Harris, 35% dos inquiridos colocaram a imigração como a sua maior preocupação, saltando sete pontos face a sondagem do mês anterior e ultrapassando a inflação e os seus 32%. Com a inflação a esmorecer e a economia a crescer (ironicamente, com a ajuda dos novos imigrantes), é natural que os republicanos tentem mudar o foco da campanha. Apenas 18% dos americanos aprovam a forma como Biden tem gerido a imigração na fronteira com o México, segundo uma sondagem da ABC News/Ipsos — muito menos do que os já poucos 31% que aprovam a sua gestão da economia e os 33% que aprovam a sua performance em geral. Nunca um presidente tinha tido um rating tão mau na gestão da imigração.\n\nRecentemente, Biden parecia ter finalmente acordado para este problema e estava disposto a aceitar as exigências republicanas de controlo da fronteira e da imigração em troca de mais ajuda à Ucrânia. No entanto, sabendo que o caos na fronteira o beneficia, Trump tem pressionado os republicanos no Congresso a fazerem cair o acordo. O ex-presidente não quer mesmo perder novamente e quer ser ele a fazer a fronteira forte de novo.\n\nApesar de ter sido um presidente bastante impopular, de continuar a ter taxas de favorabilidade negativas, de estar a ser investigado por vários crimes – foi sexta-feira condenado a pagar 83 milhões de dólares pela difamação da escritora E. Jean Carrol, que alega que ele abusou dela sexualmente –, Trump parece estar mais lançado para voltar à presidência do que nunca. Vencedor por 11 pontos percentuais nas primárias do New Hampshire contra Nikki Haley, dezenas de pontos à frente dela nas primárias em geral, mais bem-visto do que Biden e à frente dele nas sondagens para 5 de novembro, o melhor é prepararmo-nos para o regresso do “Donald”.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Doubt", "start": 361, "end": 430}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 434, "end": 498}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 562, "end": 867}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1148, "end": 1243}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1274, "end": 1411}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1332, "end": 1511}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1523, "end": 1645}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 1917, "end": 1954}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2036, "end": 2067}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2074, "end": 2093}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2183, "end": 2191}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2194, "end": 2203}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2247, "end": 2419}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 2423, "end": 2622}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2426, "end": 2439}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2576, "end": 2589}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2747, "end": 2778}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2781, "end": 2899}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2934, "end": 2949}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2952, "end": 2963}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2966, "end": 2981}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2984, "end": 2998}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3093, "end": 3214}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 3583, "end": 3590}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 3594, "end": 3600}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 3606, "end": 3613}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3606, "end": 3869}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 3648, "end": 3655}], "article_id": "4361", "lang": "pt", "text": "Eleições: Mortágua defende acordo para a legislatura sem pensar em lugares\n\nDepois de no início de janeiro se ter comprometido a negociar um acordo para uma maioria de esquerda após legislativas antecipadas de 10 de março, Mariana Mortágua, em entrevista à agência Lusa, assume que ainda não teve uma resposta do novo líder do PS, Pedro Nuno Santos, e recusa a ideia de haver “jogo escondido antes das eleições” de qualquer partido.\n\n“A prioridade é um acordo para soluções e para medidas concretas”, assegura.\n\nQuestionada sobre se o horizonte temporal para um eventual acordo pós-eleitoral deveria ser o de uma legislatura, tal como aconteceu na Geringonça, a líder do BE defende que sim porque é “essa capacidade de planear um futuro a médio prazo, de planear soluções para o tempo de uma legislatura” que “dá capacidade e músculo de resposta aos problemas do país”.\n\n“A crise na habitação não se resolve com um estalar de dedos”, sustenta.\n\nRecordando que o entendimento à esquerda “que as pessoas no país chamam carinhosamente de Geringonça foi um acordo escrito para uma legislatura que durou entre 2015 e 2019”, Mariana Mortágua entende que essa é a solução porque é “o dever de clareza e de compromisso” que se tem para com os eleitores.\n\nNa opinião da líder do BE, “não pode haver jogo escondido antes das eleições” porque não se pode acusar a Aliança Democrática “de ter um acordo escondido com o Chega, como aliás tem e já se viu nos Açores o pouco que valem as promessas que não haverá acordo nenhum”, e depois “não haver nas eleições legislativas clareza por parte dos diferentes partidos que querem fazer uma maioria com a esquerda”.\n\nQuestionada se num novo entendimento com o PS a ida do BE para o Governo será uma condição, a deputada sublinha que o partido “governará quando tiver votos e apoio popular para isso”, ressalvando que qualquer força partidária, quando se apresenta a eleições, é porque “é capaz e se sente capaz de governar”.\n\n“O mais importante e a prioridade para o Bloco de Esquerda é ter compromissos sobre propostas e sobre soluções. São propostas e soluções que queremos negociar, é sobre elas que queremos chegar a um acordo. Não sobre lugares. Nunca foi, nunca será sobre lugares”, assegura.\n\nPara Mortágua, é fundamental que “os partidos que podem fazer uma maioria com a esquerda digam ao que vêm, apresentem as suas propostas e sejam claros com os compromissos que querem fazer”.\n\n“A única hipótese de estabilidade no país tem que ser alicerçada em medidas que possam mudar as coisas, que possam resolver o problema das pessoas, essa única hipótese é de uma maioria com a esquerda”, defende.\n\nConvicta de que não haverá uma maioria absoluta em 10 de março, a coordenadora do BE defende que “em vez de ser as tricas e as lutas da direita”, o que pode dar “um horizonte de esperança e de mobilização” para as eleições é a capacidade de se falar sobre propostas.\n\n“O que é que cada partido quer para a habitação, para a saúde, para os salários, para o trabalho e que o debate seja feito sobre as propostas, sobre os entendimentos para o dia 11 de março. Isso é não só transparência e respeito pelos eleitores, como é em si um projeto mobilizador para levar as pessoas a votar”, justifica.\n\nSobre o posicionamento do PCP, que em recente entrevista a Lusa disse estar aberto a convergência à esquerda mas proposta a proposta, Mortágua escusou-se a comentar as posições dos comunistas, que considera serem responsáveis pela sua linha política e decisões.\n\n“O que posso dizer é que não vai haver uma maioria absoluta e por isso o Bloco de Esquerda entendeu e entende que é melhor haver clareza com os eleitores e é melhor que cada partido diga exatamente ao que vem, para que as pessoas, quando vão votar, poderem saber com o que contam e o que vai acontecer, sem surpresas no dia a seguir e acho que essa é uma condição da democracia”,

repúblicas autónomas e várias dezenas de grupos étnicos, religiosos e culturais que vivem submetidos à lei marcial de Moscovo. A estudiosa Veera Laine, especialista nas nacionalidades russas, antes e depois das reformas e emendas constitucionais de 2020, constatou que Vladimir Putin continua a insistir na “dimensão legal” que lhe permite justificar as suas “intervenções militares especiais”. Segundo Laine, no início da década de 2020, a liderança de Putin impôs como prioridade a centralização do poder com a introdução de alterações institucionais para evitar uma hipotética desagregação da Rússia. Proibiram-se os partidos étnicos e religiosos. As eleições dos governos locais têm sido progressivamente limitadas. A luta contra o alegado terrorismo de origem étnica tem justificado medidas policiais mais duras, mais repressivas e centralistas. Os responsáveis regionais deixaram de se chamar presidentes porque na Rússia só pode existir um presidente e esse presidente é, tão-só, V. Putin.\n\nAnna Politkovskaya, corajosa jornalista e escritora russa que foi assassinada no dia 7 de Outubro de 2006, já tinha advertido, há anos, que Putin tinha sido reeleito em circunstâncias grotescamente antidemocráticas e, no entanto, os líderes do Ocidente, dependentes das reservas de petróleo e de gás russas continuaram a prestar-lhe deferência e vassalagem. Putin, sabendo da dependência do Ocidente dessas reservas, congeminou as invasões às autoproclamadas repúblicas populares de Donestsy e Lugansk, na região do Donbass, onde os separatistas russos armados por Moscovo iniciaram uma guerra de secessão, justificando Putin a intervenção do exército russo com o pretenso auxílio aos povos da região que, segundo as autoridades de Moscovo, estava a ser vítima de genocídio perpetrado pelos nazis ucranianos. Pelos mesmos motivos Putin invadiu a Georgia, a Chechenia, a Osetia do Sul, a Abjasia e a Crimeia apoiando os grupos étnicos separatistas pró-Moscovo.\n\nEntretanto, os líderes ocidentais, dependentes do petróleo e do gás russo, deparam com a invasão da Ucrânia iniciada em finais do mês de Fevereiro e, finalmente, dão conta da gravidade da situação. A Comunidade Europeia, juntamente com os Estados Unidos, decidiu aplicar sanções à Federação russa que, no entanto, estão a provocar um efeito “boomerang” ao agravar as condições de vida dos cidadãos europeus e americanos. Até onde chegarão os sacrifícios da Europa Ocidental com esta invasão da Ucrânia? Até onde irá o expansionismo da Federação Russa?\n\nThimothy Snyder, historiador norte-americano, um dos grandes especialistas internacionais do leste europeu, comentou, num fórum que teve lugar em Nova Iorque, a nova forma de imperialismo gizado por Putin. O historiador lembrou que em 2012 Putin publicou um ensaio apresentando uma ideia que foi fervilhando na sua cabeça, ainda no tempo em que era um membro destacado da KGB. Para Putin a Rússia tem uma missão, quase messiânica, é um “estado civilizador” cuja missão histórica é “civilizar” outros povos impondo-lhes a “unidade espiritual com a Rússia”. A Ucrânia, para o presidente russo, faz parte desse “espaço vital” a que a Federação Russa tem direito e Putin nunca reconheceu, verdadeiramente, a soberania e a independência deste país, não descansando enquanto não a invadiu, estando a provocar, nos dias que correm, um estendal de mortandade, violações, deportações forçadas e destruição dantesca de cidades, vilas e aldeias da Ucrânia perante a impotência da Comunidade Europeia e da NATO, que nada mais podem fazer do que enviar armamento para os ucranianos se defenderem. Mas, até quando se vai manter esta insustentável situação que acabará por desgastar ambas as partes?\n\nPutin, com a ajuda dos meios de comunicação social pró-governo do seu país – e não pode haver outros “media” que contradigam Putin – passou a mensagem de que não existe uma guerra que opõe o exército russo ao ucraniano, mas sim “uma intervenção militar especial para desnazificar a Ucrânia”. Ora, a verdade é que V. Putin afirmou há anos que “a maior tragédia do século XX foi o colapso da ex-União Soviética”. Para o presidente russo a independência dos países que surgiram após a derrocada russa e que estavam subjugados a Moscovo nunca deveria ter acontecido. Reconquistar a Ucrânia, ou parte do seu território, é agora uma obsessão doentia para Putin. Que consequências danosas e imprevisíveis advirão para a Comunidade Europeia se os objectivos do presidente russo (parciais ou totais) forem concretizados? A seu tempo saberemos.\n\nA “reeducação” nos territórios usurpados\n\nPelo que se percepciona nos dias que correm, as democracias liberais estão sendo ameaçadas por regimes totalitários, por regimes ditatoriais de partido único e até por partidos que, afirmando-se de democráticos, as suas práticas não condizem com o regime que apregoam. Por exemplo, a Rússia de V. Putin, diz-se democrática na sua Constituição, está inserida numa economia de mercado livre, mas a maioria das suas instituições políticas e financeiras está nas mãos de indivíduos com carreira militar ou que fizeram parte dos serviços de segurança russas, criando-se um círculo fechado entre estes ditos indivíduos que, muitos deles, se tornaram oligarcas obedientes e leais a Putin – ex- KGB – que aproveitou para se impor como presidente. Numa atitude imperialista e usurpadora, e sem consultar o povo russo – que nunca deixou de estar manietado e manipulado –, invadiu a Ucrânia, país soberano e independente, no dia 24 de Fevereiro de 2022 com a pretensão de a conquistar ou, pelo menos, de conquistar parte do território ucraniano. Até ao presente momento conquistou parte do território ucraniano e está a “russificar” esse mesmo território. Impôs a língua russa e o sistema educativo está de acordo com as orientações do ministério da educação da mãe-pátria russa, ameaçando os professores que não sigam as orientações estabelecidas. Ou seja, a Rússia pretende revisionar e “reeducar” o povo ucraniano – povo que anseia por pertencer à Comunidade Europeia – e forçá-lo, a todo o custo, a ser russo. É trágico e inadmissível que isto esteja a acontecer, tentando-se apagar a história ucraniana para servir os desígnios russos. Como seria bom que o Ocidente e os Estados Unidos derrotassem de forma implacável o autocrata Putin e o remetessem para fora do território ucraniano, vergando-o e obrigando-o a respeitar o Direito Internacional. A Rússia já tem território que sobeja. A época dos imperialismos tem de acabar.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 0, "end": 66}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 225, "end": 371}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 376, "end": 417}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 628, "end": 724}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 686, "end": 724}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 752, "end": 758}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 911, "end": 1059}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 913, "end": 919}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 994, "end": 1007}], "article_id": "4363", "lang": "pt", "text": "\"A política que visa isolar a Rússia falhou\".

Já no início deste ano, os países escandinavos foram assolados por uma onda de frio que também está relacionada com o aquecimento global.\n\nO final de 2023 trouxe uma confirmação já esperada: o ano foi considerado o mais quente do planeta desde que há registo. Mas esse não foi o único registo climático quebrado em 2023, veio acompanhado de vários outros. Em vários locais do mundo, como Madrid ou Hong  Kong, foram batidos recordes de precipitação máxima num dia, tendo sido atingidos valores que não eram registados há várias décadas. Os oceanos estão a aquecer cada vez mais, o nível do mar continua a subir e o ano que se segue pode ultrapassar os recordes do que passou.\n\n“Este é um recorde sem precedentes”, afirma Pedro Nunes da associação ambientalista Zero. Em 2023, segundo dados da NASA e do Copérnico, o Programa de Observação da Terra da União Europeia, registou-se um aquecimento global de cerca de 1,5 graus Celsius, também o limite colocado pelo Acordo de Paris. O ano passado ultrapassou em 0,17 graus o de 2016, que era considerado até agora o mais quente de sempre. “Normalmente estes recordes são batidos por 0,01ºC, mas neste caso tivemos 0,17 graus. Estamos com níveis de médias de temperatura que estão a suplantar aquilo que os modelos climáticos previam. Os modelos previam que atingíssemos temperaturas deste nível só mais perto de 2030”.\n\nO professor e investigador Filipe Duarte Santos acrescenta ainda que os fenómenos extremos, sejam eles ondas de calor, de frio, níveis elevados de precipitação ou outros, estão a tornar-se mais frequentes em todo o planeta. “No que respeita à precipitação também temos eventos extremos, eventos de precipitação muito elevada em intervalos de tempo curtos, que têm tendência a provocar inundações e também secas mais frequentes e mais prolongadas”, explica Filipe Duarte Santos. \n\nNo passado mês de agosto, na China, registou-se uma semana de precipitação intensa que causou inundações históricas. Num dos reservatórios foram registados 744.8 milímetros de chuva, o valor mais alto desde 1891. Também no Paquistão, chuvas recorde causaram milhares de mortos e milhões de deslocados. Por outro lado, no Corno de África, cinco épocas consecutivas de seca foram seguidas de grandes inundações, devido à falta de capacidade do solo de absorver a água das chuvas.\n\nTambém em agosto de 2023, a temperatura da superfície dos oceanos atingiu um recorde de 20,98 graus Celsius, de acordo com dados do programa Copérnico. Os oceanos são responsáveis por absorver 90% do excesso de energia provocado pelo aumento do efeito de estufa. “O oceano é um grande regulador do clima e da temperatura que depois temos no ar. Ora, ao aquecer, deixa de ter a capacidade de regular a temperatura do ar atmosférico”, adverte Pedro Nunes, da Zero.\n\nFilipe Duarte Santos explica que a emissão para a atmosfera de gases poluentes intensifica o efeito de estufa na atmosfera da Terra e tem como consequência o aquecimento global. “Esse excesso de energia térmica não vai só para a atmosfera, vai também para o oceano, que é mais difícil de aquecer. No entanto, temos visto que os oceanos também já aumentaram a sua temperatura, sobretudo à superfície. Este aquecimento tem depois consequências na interação com a atmosfera, nas correntes oceânicas, nos ecossistemas marinhos”. Este aquecimento oceânico gera ciclones tropicais mais intensos, pois é um tipo de fenómeno que ganha energia a partir da temperatura.\n\nEntramos em 2024 e nos países escandinavos, que estão neste primeiro mês do ano a passar por uma onda de frio, já se batem recordes de temperaturas negativas. Por exemplo, no dia 3 de janeiro, na Suécia, os termómetros chegaram aos -43,6ºC, a temperatura mais baixa do país no mês de janeiro desde 1999.\n\nPedro Nunes, da Zero, lembra que também o fenómeno das ondas de frio pode estar relacionado com o aquecimento global. Segundo o técnico da associação ambienlista, o degelo no Ártico e o enfraquecimento das grandes correntes de ar em termos globais podem fazer com que um dia mais quente no Ártico traga frio para regiões contíguas, como a Europa e a América do Norte. É um fenómeno físico: o calor acaba por fazer com que o ar frio, antes concentrado no Ártico, se espalhe por outras regiões. “Ou seja, é mais fenómeno relacionado com o aquecimento global”.\n\nO que fazer perante estes extremos?\n\nA adaptação e a mitigação são as soluções que os especialistas ainda consideram possíveis para lidar com o problema das alterações climáticas. A mitigação pressupõe impedir que as alterações escalem e voltar aos níveis corretos de vários indicadores, enquanto que a adaptação surge quando já não há outras soluções à vista. “Diria que a melhor forma de adaptação ainda continua a ser a mitigação, porque ainda temos bastante margem para mitigar o problema. E a melhor forma de o mitigar é de facto atacando a origem dele através da redução de emissão de gases com efeito de estufa, que tem de ser feita neste momento de forma drástica”, considera a Zero. Pedro Nunes relembra ainda que fica muito mais caro às sociedades adaptarem-se ao problema do que o mitigarem, recorrendo a meios como as energias renováveis, “que ainda são relativamente baratas”. \n\nQuanto a instrumentos que podem ser utilizados na adaptação, Pedro Nunes entende que para as medidas serem realmente eficazes dependem de uma implementação mais local e regional destes meios aprovados a nível nacional e comunitário. Alguns exemplos incluem o Pacto Ecológico Europeu ou o Objetivo 55, o plano da União Europeia para reduzir as emissões de gases com efeito de estufa deste bloco em 55% até 2030. A nível nacional, o Plano Nacional de Energia e Clima ou o Roteiro para a Neutralidade Carbónica 2050 colocam medidas para combater o impacto das alterações climáticas.\n\nA Zero relembra ainda que, a nível nacional, os municípios portugueses têm até fevereiro de 2024 para apresentar os planos municipais de ação climática, que devem contemplar como é que pretendem adaptar-se à falta de água, à questão da seca, do calor e outros aspetos. “É através destes planos, e da sua implementação e desenho eficazes, que conseguimos responder em termos de adaptação enquanto sociedade”.\n\nPedro Nunes considera que é provável que 2024 venha a ser de novos recordes, pois “estes fenómenos têm tendência a retroalimentar-se. Temos os chamados pontos de inflexão, que são pontos que, quando quebrados,  tornam muito difícil voltar atrás e aceleram cada vez mais”. A influência do El Niño também pode contribuir para que recordes sejam quebrados. O El Niño é responsável por anos considerados secos ou muito secos e consiste no aumento da temperatura das águas do oceano Pacífico na sua porção equatorial, tendo depois impacto no clima regional e global.\n\n“Todos estes eventos extremos vão acontecer com maior frequência e, de certa forma, tornar-se mais normais. Portugal terá de adaptar-se a um clima mais seco, com eventos extremos de seca mais frequentes”, conclui o professor Filipe Duarte Santos.\n\nEventos extremos em 2023\n\nIncêndios no Canadá\n\nComeçaram em abril de 2023 e queimaram 18,5 milhões de hectares, ultrapassando o recorde anterior de 1995, de 7,1 milhões de hectares. O fumo dos incêndios provocou um aumento da poluição atmosférica em Montreal e Nova Iorque no início de junho.\n\nCalor no Brasil \n\nEm agosto, inverno no hemisfério sul, a cidade de Cuiabá, no centro do Brasil, atingiu a temperatura recorde de 41,8ºC. Todo o país foi atingido por uma onda de calor. Os climatologistas apontam como causas prováveis as alterações climáticas e o fenómeno El Niño.\n\nMarrocos +50ºC\n\nA estação metereológica de Agadir, em Marrocos, registou, pela primeira vez, uma temperatura máxima de 50,4ºC a 11 de agosto. O recorde anterior tinha sido registado em Smara, no Saara ocidental, a 13 de julho, com os termómetros a registarem 49,9ºC.\n\nIncêndios na Grécia\n\nEntre final de agosto e início de setembro, o nordeste da Grécia foi devastado por vários incêndios, os maiores de que há registo na União Europeia. Queimaram 93.000 hectares de terreno. Cerca de 25% deste país é coberto por floresta.\n\nSeca em África\n\nCinco épocas consecutivas de seca no Corno de África foram seguidas de grandes inundações devido à falta de capacidade do solo para absorver a água. A secura do solo aumentou o risco de inundações quando começou a época de chuvas, em abril e maio.\n\nCheias no Paquistão\n\nChuvas recorde causaram inundações em mais de um terço do país, causando 1739 mortos e deixando mais de vinte milhões de pessoas sem casa. As inundações arrasaram edifícios inteiros, derrubaram pontes e romperam mais de 40 reservatórios.\n\nChuvas na China \n\nNo mês de agosto foi registada uma semana de precipitação recorde que provocou inundações massivas no norte da China.

São os portugueses quem beneficia de subsídios e pensões pagos pelos imigrantes. A economia portuguesa depende do trabalho migrante.\n\nDa apresentação pública do último relatório do Observatório das Migrações, foi destacado um facto: os imigrantes foram responsáveis por um saldo positivo de 1,6 mil milhões de euros na Segurança Social. Em 2022, contribuíram com 1.861 milhões e só beneficiaram de cerca de 257 mil euros. As suas contribuições tiveram, no ano passado, o valor mais elevado de sempre. Quase duplicaram face há quatro anos. Os imigrantes têm, aliás, uma taxa de atividade superior à dos portugueses: a imigração é essencialmente laboral, os imigrantes são em regra mais jovens e há uma percentagem muito menor de reformados.\n\nAqueles que, por ignorância ou má-fé, sugerem que a imigração teria um custo para os nacionais ou para o Estado, encontram nestes dados um categórico desmentido. Os imigrantes pagam sete vezes mais ao sistema público do que recebem em subsídios ou apoios. São por isso os portugueses quem beneficia de subsídios e pensões pagos pelos imigrantes. De um ponto de vista estritamente económico e de equilíbrio da segurança social, os imigrantes são indispensáveis para o nosso país, que tem tudo a ganhar com a sua presença.\n\nOs imigrantes pesam 7,5% no total da população. Em 10 anos, o número de trabalhadores estrangeiros por conta de outrem aumentou mais de 70%. É uma transformação de fundo no perfil da população empregada e é uma das mais importantes mudanças estruturais no país. Ao contrário do que sugere a direita quando fala de “controlo”, nós não precisamos de diminuir este ritmo, mas de continuar a receber mais pessoas, só que muito melhor.\n\nSem os imigrantes, alguns setores económicos entrariam em colapso: serviços, restauração, construção, produção agrícola, transportes de passageiros e de comida, por exemplo. Mas eles e elas estão mais expostos a acidentes mortais, têm remunerações médias mais baixas nos mesmos setores e trabalham mais horas semanais do que os portugueses. São muitas vezes vítimas de engajadores sem escrúpulos ou de intermediários que os exploram e se aproveitam deles, seja na agricultura, nas obras ou nos serviços, incluindo nas plataformas digitais. Sofrem com a crise da habitação, porque os seus salários frequentemente nem chegam para um quarto. Nepaleses, bengaleses, tailandeses, guineenses, são-tomenses, paquistaneses, cabo-verdianos ou indianos recebem menos um terço do que os portugueses e são quem tem menos direitos.\n\nÉ pois insuportável que não nos organizemos, enquanto sociedade, para garantir condições decentes de trabalho, habitação, acesso à língua e ao ensino. Regular a imigração não é reprimir fluxos nem fazer discursos xenófobos, transformando em culpados de tudo as vítimas da desigualdade e da desregulação do mercado. É termos políticas públicas de acolhimento que incluam a regularização da situação laboral de todos os imigrantes, um combate sem tréguas à exploração laboral, fazendo neste campo o que se fez com o trabalho infantil na década de 1990. É incluirmos os imigrantes na representação sindical e na contratação coletiva. É subirmos os salários e termos uma oferta de habitação que os salários possam pagar. É não permitir a instalação de empresas de agricultura intensiva em territórios onde não há resposta de alojamento. É termos programas amplos de formação gratuita de língua portuguesa. É mudar as escolas que devem estar preparadas para acolher crianças de tantas nacionalidades, com mais professores, mais línguas e mais mediadores.\n\nÉ também combatermos sem tréguas o ódio, como o que recentemente matou, em Setúbal, Gurpreet Singh, jovem indiano de 25 anos, assassinado com um tiro de caçadeira no peito, disparado através de uma janela, quando descansava no seu quarto. A investigação policial considerou que o crime resultava de uma “motivação puramente racista” por parte dos dois suspeitos, de nacionalidade portuguesa, que tentaram matar todos os cinco ocupantes daquela casa. Como é que este caso não motivou um enorme sobressalto cívico e político?\n\nE a que corresponde, afinal, a retórica do “controlo da imigração” com que a extrema-direita cobre os seus discursos xenófobos contra a imigração e com que a outra direita adorna as suas declarações sobre o emprego? Quem usa esse discurso sabe bem que a economia portuguesa depende do trabalho migrante e nem sequer quer dispensá-lo, mas também não propõe mais habitação ou salário, mais direitos ou proteção. Quer mantê-lo a contribuir, mas indefeso e sem direitos."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 10, "end": 97}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 33, "end": 97}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 153, "end": 278}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 244, "end": 350}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 692, "end": 890}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 710, "end": 817}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 894, "end": 1017}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 1020, "end": 1079}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1249, "end": 1301}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 1979, "end": 2038}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 2681, "end": 2832}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2781, "end": 2832}], "article_id": "4367", "lang": "pt", "text": "Eleições: Ventura admite retirar Maló de Abreu das listas se tiver recebido subsídios abusivamente\n\nO presidente do Chega garantiu esta quinta-feira que António Maló de Abreu será excluído das listas de candidatos a deputados caso se confirme \"que recebeu abusivamente\" subsídios por ter declarado a sua residência em Luanda aos serviços do Parlamento.\n\n\"Logo que tomei conhecimento desta notícia, esta manhã, pedi para questionar o deputado Maló de Abreu sobre esta situação, que nos garantiu que a sua residência é efetivamente onde a declarou, uma vez que é deputado fora da Europa\" e que \"a sua vida e o seu círculo social, pessoal, estão em Luanda\", afirmou.\n\nAndré Ventura afirmou que, \"se descobrir que recebeu abusivamente valores e que a sua residência não era em Luanda e que o seu círculo não era em Luanda\", Maló de Abreu \"de certeza que não será\" candidato a deputado pelo Chega.\n\n\"Se houver, e se eu tiver acesso a esses elementos, o mínimo vestígio de abuso ou de fraude, comigo não vão ter duas bitolas.

Apesar disso, a acessível conexão que nos aproxima implica também algumas responsabilidades. A facilidade comunicativa pode e deve ser usada como um reforço da solidariedade e justiça entre os povos, principalmente quando essa comunicação está revestida de poder.\n\nLogo após o ataque de 7 de outubro deste ano, um dia de mortes, raptos e agressões injustificáveis perpetradas pelo Hamas, falou-se abertamente por todo o mundo sobre “o direito à defesa de Israel”. Passadas poucas semanas, tinham morrido milhares de civis palestinianos em Gaza, entre eles muitas crianças e o número aumenta diariamente. Desde a manobra de limpeza étnica sionista conhecida como Nakba em 1948, durante a consequente ocupação levada a cabo durante décadas e o regime de apartheid que o Estado de Israel tem vindo a praticar em Gaza, repleto de atrocidades e dias trágicos, foram demasiado poucas as vezes e os locais em que se ouviu falar sobre “o direito à defesa da Palestina”.\n\nA criação de grupos violentos organizados com ódio a Israel deu-se através das várias gerações de palestinianos a crescer durante uma opressão e colonização violenta. Garantidamente, alguns e algumas de nós fariam parte desses grupos se tivéssemos crescido neste contexto. Mas o Hamas não representa os palestinianos, pois muitos não se identificam com a sua violência e pretendem apenas a sua independência e liberdade. É completamente absurdo e de uma injustiça atroz colocar no mesmo saco toda a causa palestiniana e os atos violentos do Hamas, mas uma boa parte dos governos e meios de comunicação oficiais contribuem largamente para a manutenção dessa mentira. No entanto, o sofrimento que está a ser infligido vai, certamente, encaminhar mais gente para posições extremistas.\n\nO Presidente da República portuguesa conseguiu ter publicamente uma atitude constrangedora para qualquer cidadão que rejeite a chacina a ser executada pela extrema-direita israelita. A acusação feita ao embaixador da Palestina em Portugal foi a pior afronta que Marcelo podia ter feito à Fatah, a maior fração da Organização para a Libertação da Palestina criada por Yasser Arafat, que precisa de um novo apoio internacional e discorda assumidamente das ações do Hamas. A tentativa de apaziguar as reações das suas declarações (para tentar ficar bem na fotografia), durante a sua presença forçada numa manifestação de apoio à Palestina, com um discurso lastimável e pouco claro, confirmou, dessa forma, a total ausência de empatia que teve perante este assunto, tal como referiu Nabil Abuznaid.\n\nAqueles que condenam a atitude do estado de Israel e defendem a independência da Palestina são, por muitos dos defensores acérrimos dos sagrados valores ocidentais, quase automaticamente apelidados de antissemitas. No entanto, apesar de perigoso e ainda existente, o antissemitismo não se coaduna com a forte rejeição de ações ultraviolentas a civis e com o reconhecimento à autonomia de um povo. Em contrapartida, a islamofobia explica ainda uma parte considerável desta situação.\n\nNo que diz respeito à tentativa de resgatar os reféns de 7 de Outubro, pelo nível de destruição infligido a escolas, hospitais, campos de refugiados e instalações de organizações humanitárias, disparar indiscriminadamente com a justificação de estarem membros do Hamas nesses locais, independentemente das restantes pessoas presentes, não pode ser considerada uma tática de salvamento. Muitos cidadãos manifestam-se em Israel, porque reconhecem que a única hipótese é a negociação de reféns e sabem que, com este nível de violência, dificilmente verão novamente os seus familiares e amigos raptados a 7 de Outubro. Milhares de manifestantes judeus estão inseridos nas marchas de solidariedade com a Palestina, demonstrada nas ruas por milhões de pessoas de todas as nacionalidades e crenças, um pouco em todo o mundo.\n\nO que se está a passar em Gaza só pode ser considerado uma atrocidade humanitária de dimensões assustadoras, uma matança de inocentes em massa, com a conivência e apoio dos representantes governamentais dos EUA e da maioria dos representantes Europeus, e que só poderão ficar marcados como cúmplices (com algumas exceções, como os valentes do partido irlandês Sinn Féin, partidos de esquerda de alguns países e pedidos suaves de cessar-fogo dos Verdes e de Macron, mas convém relembrar a proibição francesa de manifestações pró-Palestina, com a desculpa de poder despertar sentimentos antissemitas). A posição e silêncio da União Europeia mancha cruelmente o futuro que estes países, como grupo supostamente defensor dos direitos humanos, podem vir a ter. E afasta também a humanidade de cada um dos países que desvia o olhar.\n\nJá existem bastantes pedidos declarados de cessar-fogo e alguns cortes diplomáticos com Israel (como a Bolívia e África do Sul), mas ainda não representam a urgência de uma forte e digna oposição mundial à violência que se pratica em Gaza. Uma forte e digna oposição mundial à óbvia pretensão do estado de Israel de tentar branquear a longa ocupação ilegítima e castradora da Palestina com o 7 de Outubro, como se iniciasse agora uma nova história. Uma forte e digna oposição mundial a décadas de um feroz apartheid, de manutenção de uma prisão a céu aberto, do controlo total sobre pessoas, bens e medicamentos que entram e saem de Gaza, da perpetuação da pobreza extrema ao povo palestiniano, de ilegalidades e atrocidades reconhecidas internacionalmente mas constantemente ignoradas, e dos abomináveis crimes de guerra que agora se acrescentam.\n\nO discurso de António Guterres foi um dos que revelou o mínimo de decência perante o que se está a passar. Mas esse mínimo, por todo o contexto passivo perante a morte de milhares de civis num curto espaço de tempo, pareceu-nos o máximo. A frieza e jogadas políticas dos EUA e União Europeia estão lançadas a um tal nível, que parece escapar-nos a urgência e gravidade do massacre de um povo em 2023 e normalizamos, assim, tudo isto. Apesar de começarem a surgir, são ainda poucos os discursos assertivos que condenem duramente o governo do estado de Israel, que exijam formalmente um cessar-fogo imediato e um façam corte de relações diplomáticas, que seria o mínimo aceitável. O reconhecimento internacional da independência da Palestina tem agora uma complexidade acrescida, mas aumentou também, ainda mais, a pertinência que sempre teve.\n\nO número de civis mortos e feridos não tem comparação com nada que se tenha conhecimento nos últimos anos e tudo é presenciado através das nossas televisões, computadores e telemóveis. É um genocídio como um reality show, perante o qual, entre as vozes que chegariam mais longe, são ainda poucas as que se manifestam. A maioria opta por pôr o volume mais baixo, ignorando gritos de socorro das Nações Unidas, de organizações humanitárias e de pessoas das mais variadas áreas, a correrem risco de vida no terreno a cada segundo que passa.\n\nOs interesses económicos e a geopolítica conseguem dominar tudo. As armas e as guerras ainda são dos negócios mais rentáveis e esta “guerra” não será exceção a esse princípio, assim como a disputa pelo poder económico da aliança EUA/Israel. Neste sentido, Netanyahu começa a abrir o jogo que já se mostrava óbvio, quando assume que o objetivo é ficar com um “controlo de segurança total” na faixa de Gaza, para que possa ter total liberdade de movimentos em todo o território. Entretanto, os EUA garantem que não haja interferências externas e dão o seu apoio incondicional a uma das manobras políticas mais sujas de tempos recentes, mas que encaixam que nem uma luva no seu sinistro currículo.\n\nExiste a máxima urgência em pressionar todas as organizações influentes, governos e partidos políticos a exigir um cessar-fogo imediato, a condenação do governo de Israel e a intermediação internacional para a criação dum estado palestiniano independente. Isto para que não seja cada vez mais irrespirável viver num mundo politicamente tão calculista, hipócrita e de uma covardia apática de tal forma enfiada no seu umbigo, que ignora o extermínio de um povo e contribui, com o seu silêncio, para a sua legitimação.

Este é o terceiro de uma série de sete textos sobre mulheres que ajudaram a fazer a diferença.\n\nAna Campos (n. 1952) estava no serviço de urgências do Hospital de Santa Maria, em Lisboa, a fazer internato geral, quando viu morrer uma mulher que abortara. Ficou tão impressionada que tomou uma decisão. “Ia optar por ginecologia-obstetrícia.”\n\nNaquele tempo, para se livrar de uma gravidez indesejada, havia quem introduzisse um pé de salsa na vagina e o deixasse ficar até soltar um suco venenoso. E quem fizesse chá de loureiro. E quem pusesse os pés numa bacia de água a escaldar e massajasse as pernas de baixo para cima com mostarda. E quem picasse o útero com agulhas de croché.\n\n“Se as mezinhas caseiras não davam resultado, era ir a uma parteira e ela, com maior ou menor destreza, fazia a interrupção com curetas ou agulhas de croché”, recorda. A mulher que viu morrer abortara sem assistência médica, sem anestesia, porventura num lugar insalubre, e acabara por apanhar uma septicemia.\n\nMorria-se muito. Por cada cem mil nascimentos, morriam 42,9 mulheres durante a gravidez ou após o parto. Parte significativa dessas mortes era causada por complicações relacionadas com aborto clandestino. Estimava-se que se fizessem mais de cem mil por ano.\n\nNo ano em que Ana se confrontou com aquela morte, o secretário de Estado da Saúde, Albino Aroso, mandou abrir consultas de planeamento familiar nos centros de saúde. Pelo despacho de 1976, percebe-se que queria reduzir a mortalidade materno-infantil, melhorar a taxa de saúde infantil, prevenir o aborto.\n\nUm submundo para desvendar\n\nNasceu em Viseu, Ana. Contava quatro anos e meio quando os pais, ambos professores, decidiram mudar-se para Moçambique. Dentro das limitações da época, podia decidir o seu futuro. “Gostava imenso de Biologia e queria muito tratar de pessoas.”\n\nHavia Medicina em Maputo, nos Estudos Gerais Universitários de Moçambique, actual Universidade Eduardo Mondlane. E foi lá que se matriculou. Quando os pais foram transferidos para o Norte, avançou para Lisboa. “Queria ir.” O irmão e as irmãs já tinham ido. Adolescente, Ana passara uma temporada com eles, então a estudar em Coimbra, e ficara fascinada com as lutas estudantis.\n\nExistia um submundo para desvendar na Lisboa de 1971. Num livro sobre a oposição estudantil à ditadura, os investigadores Gabriela Lourenço, Jorge Costa e Paulo Pena assinalam Comités Comunistas Revolucionários no Instituto Superior Técnico, Movimento Reorganizativo do Partido do Proletariado (MRPP) na Faculdade de Direito e Grupos e Acção Comunista na Faculdade de Medicina.\n\nAna estava habituada a discutir política em casa. O pai era um republicano anticlerical que haveria de se filiar no Partido Socialista. Lera livros censurados e tivera contactos com opositores do regime. “Seis meses bastaram para que eu pudesse ler mais ou menos as entrelinhas de tudo e perceber que, em Medicina, quem era mais influente era o Partido Comunista.”\n\nAs correntes maoistas e os grupos trotskistas tinham alguma importância. E estes últimos despertaram o seu interesse. “Faziam análises políticas mais claras, mais marcados pela política internacional, pelo enquadramento nas lutas gerais, pela emancipação dos povos.”\n\nEm Outubro de 1972, um estudante afecto ao MRPP, José António Ribeiro Santos, foi assassinado pela polícia política num “meeting contra a repressão e o imperialismo”, no Instituto Superior de Ciências Económicas e Financeiras (ISCEF), hoje Instituto Superior de Economia e Gestão. As lutas estudantis contra a Guerra Colonial e a ditadura intensificaram-se.\n\nEnvolvida na contestação, Ana foi detida no dia 13 de Dezembro de 1973. Ia numa manifestação convocada por várias correntes. Um polícia, que estava a guardar um banco, deixou o seu posto de trabalho e começou a bater nos manifestantes a que conseguiu botar mão. “Apanhou quatro ou cinco pessoas, uma das quais eu, que entrei em pânico e não consegui correr o suficiente.” Entre os detidos naquela acção, estaria o filho de um embaixador. Ana questiona-se se terá sido por isso que foi tratada de “forma civilizada” no forte-prisão de Caxias e libertada pouco depois.\n\nNão se amedrontou. “Era uma convicta militante. Não era uma prisão que me ia afastar. Tinha era de ter mais cuidado.” Por dois meses, absteve-se de participar em protestos públicos. Depois, não resistiu.\n\nMilitava na Liga Comunista Internacionalista (LCI), que fora fundada em 1972 e haveria de se fundir com o Partido Revolucionário dos Trabalhadores (PRT), dando origem em 1978 ao Partido Socialista Revolucionário (PSR), que, por sua vez, haveria de se aliar à União Democrática Popular (UDP) e à Política XXI para formar, em 1999, o Bloco de Esquerda. Ainda não vivia com Francisco Louçã, que frequentava o mesmo circuito.\n\nNo 24 de Abril de 1974, a sua célula esteve reunida. “Íamos colar vinhetas. Eram uns papéis pardos que carimbávamos letra a letra, a vermelho ou azul. Aquele dizia: ‘Abaixo a Guerra Colonial’! Tínhamos estado a fazer isso e íamos colar no Hospital de Santa Maria e arredores.”\n\nNo dia 25 de Abril de 1974, soube do golpe de Estado e não perdeu tempo. “A meio da manhã consegui safar-me e fui para o Carmo. Estava no Chiado quando se deu a passagem dos chaimites.” Juntara-se tanta gente que não conseguiu seguir. “Estava tudo animadíssimo.”\n\nDo golpe fez-se revolução. E uma das vertentes dessa revolução foi a legalização dos métodos contraceptivos e a introdução das consultas de planeamento familiar. A contracepção fora proibida em 1942. A pílula, inventada em 1960, só podia ser vendida em Portugal para supostos fins de regulação do ciclo menstrual.\n\nSeparar a sexualidade da reprodução\n\nA Associação para o Planeamento da Família iniciara caminho, mas não foi tão simples como pode parecer. Não era só a força da religião Católica a mandar as famílias aceitar os filhos que Deus mandasse. Lembra Ana que entre os próprios técnicos de saúde havia resistência. E que Purificação Araújo, na Direcção-Geral de Saúde, estruturou cursos de formação e orientou a abertura das consultas.\n\nNo processo de criação e consolidação do Serviço Nacional de Saúde, entre 1975 e 1982, os médicos eram obrigados a ir um ano trabalhar para uma zona menos desenvolvida. Chamava-se a isso Serviço Médico à Periferia.\n\nA Ana calhou-lhe trabalhar em Reguengos de Monsaraz, Évora, em 1977. “Foi o ano mais empolgante da minha vida profissional. Fui abrir um posto clínico e a consulta de planeamento familiar mesmo em Reguengos.”\n\nAs mulheres aderiam. “Nunca se tinham posto nuas à frente de ninguém. O desnudar, o permitir a observação dos órgãos sexuais, tudo isso era uma experiência muito nova para elas e todas elas começavam a consulta a dizer: ‘Ai. Eu tenho muita, muita vergonha.” Explicava-lhes a importância da observação no diagnóstico de doenças. E falava-lhes dos métodos contraceptivos.\n\nHomens havia que se opunham ao uso da pílula. “Tinham medo de que as mulheres tivessem alguns rasgos de libertinagem: podiam ter sexo com outros porque não iam engravidar.” Também havia os que apoiam. Ocorre-lhe uma mulher com “um marido muito compreensivo”. “Nuns dias tomava ela a pílula, noutros, ele.”\n\nUma vez separada a reprodução da sexualidade, o número de filhos por mulher começou a baixar de forma substancial. As famílias puderam, por fim, preocupar-se com a realização pessoal e a educação dos filhos.\n\nNaqueles primeiros anos, era frequente Ana ver em consulta mulheres com experiência de aborto clandestino. “Assim que tinham confiança, diziam que tinham feito três, quatro, cinco. Nalgumas dessas vezes, se calhar, nem havia gravidez evolutiva. As mulheres tinham a primeira falta [de menstruação] e queriam libertar-se.”\n\nUma longa luta\n\nO planeamento familiar ficou consagrado na Constituição de 1976, mas o aborto continuou proibido em qualquer circunstância. Quem o praticasse incorria numa pena de dois a oito anos de prisão — só se a mulher pretendesse “ocultar a sua desonra” a pena seria inferior.\n\nDuas organizações de mulheres reclamavam mudança. Em Maio de 1974, o Movimento Democrático das Mulheres entregara à Junta de Salvação Nacional o seu caderno reivindicativo, no qual incluía a legalização do aborto. No mesmo mês, igual exigência surgira numa brochura do Movimento de Libertação das Mulheres, que lançou em 1975 o Movimento pela Contracepção, Aborto Livre e Gratuito. A UMAR juntou-se a esta luta em 1978.\n\nDois julgamentos marcados para 1979 ajudaram a pôr o tema na agenda: a jornalista Maria Antónia Palla fizera uma reportagem sobre aborto e fora acusada de atentado ao pudor e incitamento ao crime; a enfermeira Conceição Massano abortara quando ainda era solteira e estudante e fora denunciada por alguém que lhe apanhara o diário.\n\nAna sentia a urgência da mudança. Enquanto membro do LCI, integrou a Campanha Nacional Pelo Aborto e Contracepção. Foi uma das grandes dinamizadoras desse movimento lançado por diversas organizações. Participou em “todas as iniciativas” e nas reuniões preparatórias de um projecto de lei sobre a despenalização do aborto. Em 1982, a União da Esquerda para a Democracia Socialista (UEDS) disponibilizou-se para apresentar essa proposta na Assembleia da República.\n\nAinda houve uma tentativa falhada do PCP (1982) até o Parlamento aprovar uma proposta do PS (1984), muito mais restritiva do que a que Ana defendia. A interrupção voluntária da gravidez foi então legalizada em caso de malformação do feto, violação ou risco de vida para a mulher.\n\nPara Ana, aquele era um direito das mulheres, mas não era assim que se falava no Parlamento. Aí, o discurso político girava em torno da ideia de “flagelo social”, “grave problema de saúde”, pobreza.\n\nAinda era assim em 1998, aquando do primeiro referendo (não vinculativo). Nessa época, o acto já se alterara, mas nem por isso estava isento de risco. Quem não podia pagar serviços discretos prestados por clínicas privadas ia a parteiras de vão de escada ou tomava Cytotec, um fármaco usado para prevenir úlceras e induzir o parto.\n\n“Não pode ser dado hoje nenhum contributo mais importante para o virar de página quanto ao respeito pelas mulheres do que a despenalização do aborto”, escreveu Ana Campos, num livro que lançou em 2007, pouco antes do segundo referendo. “Ao legalizar o aborto e terminar a perseguição às mulheres que abortaram, a lei estará a dar um sinal de adaptação à realidade, mas, mais do que isso, estará a mostrar como assume o sentido profundo da liberdade e responsabilidade.”\n\nNaquela última campanha, há muito nos quadros da Maternidade Alfredo da Costa de que foi directora clínica adjunta, Ana Campos incorporou o movimento Médicos pela Escolha. Desafiaram-na jovens colegas. “Eles foram uma lufada de ar fresco. Destroçados com a derrota, quiseram mobilizar este grupo profissional.”\n\nEntre aqueles dois referendos, várias mulheres foram julgadas por aborto. “Esses foram momentos de grande mobilização das organizações de mulheres, o que foi muito importante para que a opinião pública se apercebesse de que as mulheres podiam ser julgadas e condenadas por aborto.”\n\nOs movimentos pelo sim conseguiram explicar-se melhor. E “11 de Fevereiro de 2007 tornou-se uma data histórica em relação aos direitos das mulheres e da saúde sexual e reprodutiva”. Foi despenalizada a interrupção voluntária da gravidez a pedido da mulher, até às dez semanas, em estabelecimento de saúde autorizado. O número de intervenções baixou — de 18.014 em 2008 para 11.640 em 2021.\n\nAlargar o prazo para as 12 semanas ajudaria a reduzir o aborto clandestino que ainda existe. “Não se tem de temer que seja enorme o número de mulheres que o vão fazer entre as dez e as 12 semanas. Há países, como a Holanda, que vão até às 24 e em que a média é oito a nove. Quando a pessoa decide que não pretende a gravidez, movimenta-se.” Só uma pequena minoria demora um pouco mais, até por dificuldade de acesso.\n\nO direito não está garantido. Talvez nunca esteja. Talvez seja, como diz Ana, um termómetro político. Em cada vez mais hospitais, a falta de profissionais não objectores de consciência impede a prática, forçando as mulheres a maiores deslocações. “Quando contratam equipas, as administrações hospitalares têm de garantir que há pelo menos alguém que não é objector de consciência”, defende. “Alguns são objectores à decisão da mulher, não são objectores em relação às outras alíneas. Não admitem que as mulheres possam decidir. Acho que esse é o ponto-chave sobre o qual o poder médico tem de ser questionado.”\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 42, "end": 62}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 65, "end": 178}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 528, "end": 682}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 706, "end": 769}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1460, "end": 1476}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1540, "end": 1556}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 1758, "end": 1873}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2000, "end": 2024}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 2170, "end": 2280}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2170, "end": 2280}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2507, "end": 2626}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2863, "end": 3003}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2922, "end": 2939}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3266, "end": 3321}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3329, "end": 3404}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3456, "end": 3605}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3502, "end": 3519}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 3644, "end": 3658}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 3752, "end": 3888}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 4097, "end": 4244}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4248, "end": 4461}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4310, "end": 4320}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 4464, "end": 4575}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4643, "end": 4650}], "article_id": "4375", "lang": "pt", "text": "Oito países travam ajuda a agência da ONU por ligações ao Hamas\n\nUNRWA demitiu e investiga funcionários que terão estado alegadamente envolvidos no ataque de 7 de outubro a Israel. Portugal pede “investigação completa e rigorosa”.\n\nEstados Unidos, Canadá, Reino Unido, Austrália, Itália, Finlândia, Países Baixos e Alemanha... o número de países que anunciaram a suspensão do apoio financeiro à Agência das Nações Unidas de Assistência aos Refugiados da Palestina (UNRWA, na sigla em inglês) não para de aumentar. Em causa está o alegado envolvimento de funcionários da agência, que já viram o seu contrato terminado e que estão a ser investigados, no ataque do Hamas de 7 de outubro. Israel já disse que, depois da guerra, não haverá lugar na Faixa de Gaza para a UNRWA. \n\nEsta agência da ONU foi criada em 1949 e garante cuidados de saúde, educação e ajuda humanitária aos palestinianos na Faixa de Gaza, mas também na Cisjordânia ocupada, na Jordânia, no Líbano e na Síria. Os EUA são o maior financiador, garantindo um quarto dos seus fundos (340 milhões de dólares em 2022), tendo anunciado logo na sexta-feira a suspensão da ajuda, após a UNRWA confirmar a demissão de funcionários e a abertura de uma investigação. Seguiram-se outros países ocidentais - entre eles a Alemanha, o segundo maior doador com 202 milhões de dólares em 2022 -, sendo que a União Europeia não afasta a hipótese de tomar “novas medidas” após a investigação.\n\n“Portugal expressa forte preocupação face às alegações de envolvimento de funcionários da UNRWA no ataque terrorista de 7 de outubro”, reagiu o Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros português no X (antigo Twitter). Portugal contribuiu com 105 mil euros para a agência em 2022. “Reconhecendo o trabalho vital da UNRWA, Portugal associa-se à União Europeia e apela à adoção de medidas adequadas e a uma investigação completa e rigorosa”, acrescentava a mensagem, remetendo para uma declaração do chefe da diplomacia europeia, Josep Borrell. \n\nBruxelas mostra-se “extremamente preocupada” com as suspeitas, lembrando o “papel vital” que a agência da ONU tem desempenhado no apoio aos palestinianos. “Estamos em contacto com a UNRWA, esperamos total transparência sobre as alegações e que tome medidas imediatas contra os funcionários envolvidos. A Comissão avaliará novas medidas e tirará lições com base no resultado de uma investigação completa e abrangente”, indicou Borrell. \n\nNa sexta-feira, o comissário-geral da UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, disse em comunicado que Israel tinha fornecido “informações sobre o alegado envolvimento” de funcionários da agência nos ataques de 7 de outubro. “Para proteger a capacidade da agência de providenciar assistência humanitária, tomei a decisão de terminar de imediato os contratos destes funcionários e lançar uma investigação para estabelecer a verdade sem demora”, reiterando que qualquer funcionário que se prove que esteve envolvido nos atos de terrorismo “será responsabilizado, inclusive através de processo criminal”. \n\nNão foram dados mais pormenores do número de pessoas envolvidas (apesar de a imprensa israelita falar de 12) e de que forma estiveram envolvidos no ataque do Hamas. Mark Regev, um conselheiro do primeiro-ministro israelita Benjamin Netanyahu, falou à BBC de professores que celebraram abertamente os acontecimentos ou de uma refém que disse ter estado na casa de alguém que trabalhava para a UNRWA.\n\nO Hamas reagiu, ontem, condenando “firmemente a campanha de incitamento lançada pela entidade criminosa sionista contra as instituições internacionais” que contribuem para ajudar o povo palestiniano que, dizem, “está a ser sujeito a um genocídio nazi”. Já a Autoridade Palestiniana criticou a suspensão dos apoios antes do fim da investigação. “Apelamos aos países que anunciaram a cessação do apoio à UNRWA para que revertam imediatamente a sua decisão, que envolve sérios riscos”, disse Hussein al-Sheikh, secretário-geral do Comité Executivo da Organização de Libertação da Palestina.\n\nIsrael, pelo contrário, congratulou-se com a decisão dos países ocidentais que suspenderam a ajuda, apelando a que outros lhes sigam o exemplo e deixando claro que não quer que a agência da ONU desempenhe um papel em Gaza no “dia seguinte” à guerra. “Os laços da UNRWA com o Hamas, providenciando refúgio para os terroristas e perpetuando o seu poder, são inegáveis. A liderança deve ser afastada e investigada minuciosamente pelo seu conhecimento destas atividades. Na reconstrução de Gaza, a UNRWA deve ser substituída por agências dedicadas à paz e ao desenvolvimento genuíno”, indicou o chefe da diplomacia israelita, Israel Katz, no X. \n\n\"É chocante assistir à suspensão de fundos em reação às alegações contra um pequeno grupo de empregados\", atendendo às medidas já decididas e desempenho da agência \"da qual dependem dois milhões de pessoas para a sua simples sobrevivência\", declarou em comunicado Philippe Lazzarini.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 0, "end": 20}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 23, "end": 31}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 125, "end": 133}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 237, "end": 245}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 344, "end": 358}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 422, "end": 432}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 436, "end": 461}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 464, "end": 501}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 504, "end": 531}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 534, "end": 744}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 534, "end": 577}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 748, "end": 833}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 820, "end": 833}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 838, "end": 887}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 890, "end": 1060}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1063, "end": 1087}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1071, "end": 1087}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1091, "end": 1253}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 1166, "end": 1184}, {"tag": "Red_Herring", "start": 1187, "end": 1253}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 1256, "end": 1267}], "article_id": "4376", "lang": "pt", "text": "A Covid nunca vem só!\n\nSeria bom encarar a nova estirpe de Covid, já espalhada por Portugal e mundo, como uma gripe outonal.

Não há turistas nem luzes decorativas nem a árvore de natal na Praça da Manjedoura. Frente à Basílica da Natividade, uma das mais antigas igrejas do mundo, construída sobre a gruta onde Maria terá dado à luz, há um menino Jesus queimado pelas bombas de Gaza, dentro de uma incubadora verdadeira, numa instalação da artista Rana Bishara.\n\nSe alguém quisesse seguir as estrelas para encontrar o caminho, como se conta que aconteceu há mais de 2 mil anos, confundi-las-ia provavelmente com as bombas israelitas. A véspera de Natal foi uma das noites mais sangrentas desde o início dos ataques. 166 civis palestinianos foram assassinados entre a véspera e o dia de Natal, quase 400 ficaram feridos. Uns e outros somam-se à conta macabra de mais de 20 mil mortos e 54 mil feridos desde 7 de outubro, quase todos em Gaza.\n\nPerto de dois milhões de palestinianos foram expulsos de suas casas, mais de cem funcionários da ONU foram mortos, quase uma centena de jornalistas perderam a vida sob os bombardeamentos do exército israelita. Todos os dias se enterram crianças retiradas sem vida de baixo dos escombros.\n\nNão têm sido poupados hospitais, nem escolas, nem igrejas, nem mesquitas, nem campos de refugiados. Não há alimentação, nem medicamentos. Nem há para onde ir. É um colapso humanitário a acontecer perante os olhos do mundo. Um genocídio diante de nós, com a cumplicidade da maior potência do mundo, que tem bloqueado as resoluções sobre o cessar-fogo na ONU. Nem os apelos desesperados de Guterres nem as súplicas do Papa para que cessem as operações militares têm valido.\n\nA ofensiva israelita continua, construída sobre a falsidade escandalosa de que há uma solução militar para o conflito no médio oriente. Acrescentando a mais de meio século de ocupação ilegal dos territórios palestinianos e a 75 anos de violação do direito internacional a carnificina em curso.

O governo do país, amigável com a Europa, proibiu a migração a partir de Agadez e, em troca, a União Europeia despejou milhões de euros nos cofres do Níger e na economia local.\n\nMas no verão passado, após generais terem tomado o poder no Níger num golpe militar, a União Europeia suspendeu a ajuda financeira ao governo - e em resposta os generais cortaram em novembro o acordo de migração com a União Europeia. Os portões estão novamente abertos, e vagas frescas de migrantes cheios de esperança estão outra vez a passar por eles, para satisfação de muitos dos habitantes da cidade.\n\n“É com a migração que equilibramos os nossos rendimentos”, diz Aicha Maman, uma mãe solteira que tem um negócio de ajuda aos migrantes e no ano passado esteve presa em Agadez acusada de tráfico.\n\nA decisão do Níger, no entanto, inquieta os responsáveis europeus, que temem que o fim da parceria com aquele país leve muitas pessoas a tentar a traiçoeira viagem para norte.\n\nA via terrestre do Níger através de Agadez é encarada por muitos migrantes como mais barata e menos perigosa do que a via marítima no Atlântico - partindo da costa Ocidental de África em frágeis embarcações em direção às Canárias. Mesmo com a via do Níger oficialmente encerrada, a migração em direção à Europa em 2022 atingiu o ponto mais alto desde 2016.\n\nA migração está uma vez mais no topo da lista de prioridades de diversos governos europeus, e os partidos de extrema-direita que querem expulsar os imigrantes estão a subir meses antes de eleições cruciais para o Parlamento Europeu, um dos três pilares institucionais da União Europeia.\n\nEmmanuela Del Re, a principal diplomata da União Europeia para a região de África que inclui o Níger, disse recentemente que a junta militar do Níger estava a retaliar contra a União Europeia por esta se recusar a reconhecê-la: “Estão a fazer chantagem contra a União Europeia com a imigração”.\n\nEm Agadez, um posto avançado no deserto que há séculos é uma encruzilhada de rotas de comércio e migração, milhares de famílias dependem do transporte, do alojamento e da venda de bens aos migrantes.\n\nCom a migração novamente legal, voltaram as oportunidades: Os jovens estão a comprar pick-ups novas para levar as pessoas para o norte. Negociantes cujo negócio era facilitar alojamento e transporte aos migrantes foram soltos da prisão.\n\nNuma destas  manhãs, na sua casa de tijolos de taipa vermelha, Maman disse que tencionava recomeçar o seu negócio de alojar migrantes em casas a que os locais chamam “guetos” e pô-los em contacto com os camionistas - um negócio do qual depende há anos para sustentar os seus filhos e os seus pais.\n\n“Achamos desde sempre que a migração é uma atividade económica”, diz Mohamed Anacko, o funcionário público mais importante da região de Agadez. “Não é tráfico, é transporte”.\n\nNuma destas manhãs dois homens na casa dos 20 descansavam num abrigo nos arredores de Agadez. Os homens, que identificamos apenas com os nomes próprios para não serem detetados pelas autoridades, tinham chegado da vizinha Nigéria uns dias antes trazendo com eles cantis, óculos de sol e lenços para a cabeça necessários para a viagem de três dias até à Líbia.\n\nUmas semanas antes a viagem teria sido ilegal pela lei anti-migração do Niger, mas agora podem ir livremente para o norte. Um deles, Abubakar, disse que ia em busca de um emprego na construção na Líbia, mas já que era fã do Real Madrid tencionava no futuro ir para Espanha. O outro, Adamou, disse que tinha os olhos em Paris mas que primeiro quaisquer pequenos trabalhos na Líbia serviriam.\n\nAtualmente, todas as semanas saem de Agadez cerca de 100 pick-ups com 30 passageiros encafuados em cada uma, com escolta militar como protecção contra bandidos. Antes do governo do Níger ter revogado a lei no ano passado, umas poucas dezenas de camiões saiam ilegalmente, dizem as autoridades locais e investigadores.\n\nHá poucos incentivos para manter baixo o número destas caravanas: quando o Níger começou a aplicar a legislação anti-migração em 2016, milhares de locais perderam a sua única fonte de rendimento. Agadez tornou-se essencialmente no posto fronteiriço da União Europeia, a milhares de quilómetros das fronteiras europeias.\n\nUm número incontável de pessoas que transitam pelo Níger nunca tentam chegar à Europa; muitos trabalham em países do Norte de África durante alguns anos antes de regressarem a casa.\n\nAinda assim, assustada com a crise migratória de 2015 quando mais de um milhão de pessoas chegou à Europa vinda sobretudo do Médio Oriente e de África, a União Europeia apressou-se a manter os imigrantes à distância, dando apoio financeiro a alguns países chave para a travessia em troca de controlos fronteiriços mais apertados.\n\nPara o Níger, foi uma troca apetecível\n\nDesce 2014 até ao golpe do verão passado, a União Europeia forneceu quase mil milhões de euros em ajuda bilateral ao governo do Níger, segundo números oficiais da UE, além das centenas de milhares gastos por diversos países europeus.\n\nA União Europeia prometeu também ajudar a encontrar novos empregos àqueles cujo modo de vida vinha da migração na região de Agadez. Mas funcionários locais na cidade dizem que os prometidos fundos beneficiaram apenas cerca de 900 das 6 500 pessoas envolvidas no negócio da migração.\n\n“Aos que estavam a fazer milhões com a migração foi-lhes oferecido muito menos”, diz Rhoumour Ahmet Tchilouta, um investigador em questões de imigração de Agadez, referindo-se aos milhões na moeda local, equivalentes a milhares de euros que havia quem ganhasse num mês.\n\nMesmo assim, mais de 4 milhões de migrantes transitaram por Agadez desde 2016, segundo a Agência para as Migrações das Nações Unidas.\n\nOs que procuram partir escondem-se nas casas do “gueto” ocultadas atrás de altos portões metálicos em zonas residenciais. Ou passam ao lado da cidade escapando à vigilância policial através de trilhos desconhecidos, com o resultado que milhares desaparecem ou morrem, segundo as organizações humanitárias.\n\n“O Sahara engole um número incontável de migrantes, tal como o Mediterrâneo”, diz Azizou CheChou, dirigente do Telefone de Alarme do Sahara, uma organização sem fins lucrativos que resgata migrantes perdidos no deserto.\n\nDezenas de milhares de outros passam por Agadez na direção oposta: de regresso do Norte de África, escorraçados por milícias na Líbia ou forças de segurança na Argélia. Em Agadez, a Agência das Nações Unidas para as Migrações repatria-os para os seus países de origem com a ajuda financeira da União Europeia.\n\nAgadez tornou-se numa encruzilhada onde os que procuram atingir o Norte de África se cruzam com os que regressam a casa nos seus países da África Central ou Ocidental, e onde colidem as suas histórias de esperança e sofrimento.\n\nUma manhã no mês passado, numa dessas casas delapidadas, uns quantos homens da Serra Leoa que esperavam por serem repatriados conversavam com outros migrantes do seu país que se dirigiam para norte.\n\nEntre eles estava Mabinty Conteh, de 23 anos, que transportava a sua sobrinha de nove meses. Conteh disse que a sua irmã, a mãe do bebé, tinha morrido no ano passado, e que os seus pais tinham morrido de ébola há anos. Ela queria chegar a Itália através da Líbia mas estava a ficar sem dinheiro.\n\n“Já não tenho nenhuma família”, disse Conteh, que vendia roupas na Serra Leoa. “Não tenho nada”.\n\nOs seus compatriotas tentaram dissuadi-la, partilhando histórias de violência sexual e agressões por guardas fronteiriços na Argélia, e escravatura sexual na Líbia. Mais de uma dúzia de migrantes descreveram em entrevistas as suas detenções em condições horrendas nas prisões argelinas, e terem sido forçados a caminhar durante horas pelo deserto antes de terem sido trazidos para Agadez.\n\nAlfred Conteh, um camionista de 29 anos da Serra Leoa (nenhuma relação familiar com Mabinty Conteh), descreveu como os detidos numa prisão argelina estavam com tanta sede que vendiam uns aos outros garrafas de urina.

Se bem nos lembrarmos, o resultado das eleições de 2019 colocou o PS à beira da maioria absoluta e mudou quase radicalmente a sua postura relativamente aos partidos à sua esquerda. Se entre 2015 e 2019 tinha sido possível impor ao PS um conjunto de medidas positivas para as camadas sociais mais prejudicadas pela governação PSD/CDS, a partir de 2019, a chantagem que o PS ficou em condições de exercer tornou tudo mais difícil.\n\nSe bem nos lembrarmos, sucederam-se as ameaças de demissão do Governo caso algumas medidas fossem aprovadas. Foi o caso, por exemplo, da reposição do tempo de serviço dos professores. Perante a possibilidade de aprovação de uma medida nesse sentido contra os votos do PS, António Costa ameaçou com a demissão do Governo, o que levou o PSD - sim, o PSD - a voltar atrás. O mesmo sucedeu com a possibilidade de baixa do IVA na eletricidade.\n\nA intenção do PS para voltar às políticas de direita sem empecilhos começava a ser cada vez mais notória. Em plena pandemia, o Orçamento retificativo de 2020 ficou muito aquém do que a situação de emergência exigia e o Orçamento para 2021 só foi viabilizado pelo sentido de responsabilidade do PCP que, tendo obtido a muito custo a decisão de pagamento da totalidade dos salários das centenas de milhares de trabalhadores que se encontravam em lay-off entendeu, ao contrário do BE, que esse Orçamento devia ser viabilizado.\n\nContudo, a chantagem prosseguiu, e a partir de junho de 2021 tornou-se evidente que o PS não estava disponível nem interessado em negociar fosse o que fosse relativamente ao Orçamento para 2022, pelo que o dilema, para o PCP, era o seguinte: ou perdia a face e cedia à chantagem do PS e de Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, viabilizando um Orçamento que não respondia minimamente aos problemas que o país enfrentava, ou agia em coerência e rejeitava o Orçamento, mesmo tendo de se sujeitar a uma intensa campanha de vitimização por parte do PS, que o iria responsabilizar pela queda do Governo e que o iria acusar, falsamente, de com essa opção abrir as portas ao regresso da direita, como se tal regresso, a verificar-se, não fosse da responsabilidade do próprio PS.\n\nA história foi a que sabemos e a campanha decorreu o signo de uma chantagem baseada em duas falsidades: a de que a queda do Governo tinha sido da responsabilidade do PCP e do BE e não de quem a provocou, quando não há nenhuma norma constitucional que preveja a demissão do Governou ou a dissolução da AR caso a proposta de Orçamento não seja aprovada, e a de que havia um empate técnico entre o PS e o PSD, pelo que, com a muleta da extrema-direita, o PSD poderia voltar ao Governo.\n\nA primeira mentira custou muito a desmentir perante uma narrativa de vitimização mil vezes repetida. Algumas pessoas chegaram a sugerir que, se a intenção do PS era a de que a Orçamento deveria ser rejeitado para se vitimizar, o PCP deveria trocar-lhe as voltas, aprovando o Orçamento apesar de discordar dele. Sucede que o PCP não tem uma massa gelatinosa no lugar da coluna vertebral e não troca princípios por tacticismo, mesmo que isso possa ter, como teve, pesados custos eleitorais.\n\nA segunda mentira foi a de que havia um empate técnico entre o PS e o PSD. O impacto desta falsa ideia de que era preciso votar no PS para evitar o regresso da direita teve efeitos tão irracionais como que ocorreu no distrito de Évora. Senão vejamos: o distrito elege três Deputados. Em 2019 foram eleitos dois Deputados do PS e um da CDU. Em 2022, a transferência de votos da CDU para o PS não beneficiou o PS, que manteve os dois Deputados, mas beneficiou o PSD que elegeu um Deputado à custa da CDU. Eis como o medo da direita só beneficiou precisamente a direita.\n\nSucede, porém, que as sondagens têm destas coisas, e apesar da mentira mil vezes repetida de que haveria um empate técnico, o PS ficou nada menos de 14 pontos percentuais à frente do PSD e obteve a maioria absoluta, que tanta gente dizia não querer. Só que, como quem não quer ser lobo não lhe veste a pele, quem não quer uma maioria absoluta não deve votar para que ela aconteça.\n\nDois anos passados, já houve tempo para refletir sobre as lições de 2022. O PS que, com a maioria absoluta, ficou - como se costuma dizer - com a faca e o queijo na mão, usou a faca e cortou a mão."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 0, "end": 75}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 14, "end": 75}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 14, "end": 39}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 114, "end": 245}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 150, "end": 291}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 152, "end": 177}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 607, "end": 711}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 1353, "end": 1505}], "article_id": "4384", "lang": "pt", "text": "Trump diz que \"fraqueza e incompetência\" de Biden provocaram ataque do Hamas\n\nO ex-presidente dos Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, afirmou ontem que foi a \"fraqueza e incompetência\" do seu sucessor, Joe Biden, que provocou o ataque do Hamas a Israel, a 7 de Outubro, que fez mais de 1.400 mortos.\n\nTrump, que encerrou um encontro da Coligação Judaica Republicana realizada em Las Vegas, também criticou a ajuda, de cerca de 94 milhões de euros, em assistência humanitária à Faixa de Gaza e Cisjordânia ocupada, destinada a mais de um milhão de deslocados pelo conflito, anunciada por Biden na semana passada.\n\n\"O Hamas recebeu imediatamente 100 milhões de dólares.

O vírus mostrou-se capaz de infetar células de todos os órgãos mencionados mas fez um trabalho particularmente bom ao infiltrar-se nalguns tipos de neurónios que produzem dopamina – um neurotransmissor responsável pelas sensações de prazer, motivação, memória, sono e movimento.\n\nSegundo os cientistas, uma vez infetadas, essas células podem perder a capacidade de crescer e dividir-se: param também de produzir dopamina e, em vez disso, enviam sinais que causam inflamação.\n\nComo a perda de neurónios produtores de dopamina está associada à doença de Parkinson – uma condição neurodegenerativa de desenvolvimento lento que causa tremores e muitas vezes demência -, as pessoas que foram infetadas pelo coronavírus correm um risco aumentado de desenvolver os sintomas da doença em algum ponto das suas vidas, escreveram os especialistas.\n\n“Continuamos a descobrir novos tipos de células que podem ser infetadas pelo vírus”, garantiu Shuibing Chen, professor de biologia química na Weill Cornell Medicine e principal autor do estudo, à revista ‘Fortune’. “Ainda estamos a tentar entender como isso os prejudica.

Em outros casos, em que o tema esteja presente, estão em formação dois grandes pólos:\n\nO negacionismo / negação de qualquer ação relevante, que corresponde na Europa e nos Estados Unidos à aliança de conservadores com extrema-direita;\n\nO remendo climático e as negociatas climáticas, que corresponde à aliança de centro com verdes e esquerda.\n\nA razão pela qual o estado do debate sobre justiça climática é catastrófico é simples: qualquer que fosse o resultado de um debate nestes termos teria como desfecho necessário a catástrofe, o caos climático.\n\nA pulsão da esquerda de se aliar ao centro para tentar evitar governos em que a extrema-direita participa, só alimentará o enraizamento da extrema-direita nas sociedades, como os últimos anos deixaram bem claro. Ao abdicar de programas de transformação radical da sociedade enquanto esta sociedade colapsa, a esquerda entregou a sensação de “alternativa” à extrema-direita.\n\nÉ irrelevante quão apaixonadas sejam as palavras e quão gritadas sejam as juras de empenho na ação climática. Sabemos há muitos anos o que é necessário fazer para travar a crise climática: cortar 50% das emissões globais de gases com efeito de estufa até 2030, com base nas emissões de 2010. Em Portugal é muito mais do que isso. Nenhuma eleição, nenhum partido está a propor algo que seja compatível com o que é necessário. O resultado de eleições que ocorram em 2024 em teoria é um mandato que durará 4 ou 5 anos, terminando a um ou dois anos de 2030. Ao não apresentarem programas compatíveis com cortar a maior parte das emissões neste período, o que os partidos nos dizem é que rejeitam a ciência climática e que esperam que a Física, a Química e a Biologia se acomodem à sua análise política errada.\n\nO movimento pela justiça climática está numa situação peculiar. Por um lado, existe a pulsão de pedir ou propor algo a partidos com que simpatiza, embora estes se recusem a assumir a emergência climática e a fazer o que é necessário. Por outro lado, o movimento não pode assistir da bancada a estas eleições onde milhares de milhões podem participar.\n\nPeríodos eleitorais são momentos em que há pequenas pausas hegemónicas na sociedade, para pouco depois tudo seguir mais ou menos igual, com novas caras a continuarem o negócio do capitalismo. O movimento pela justiça climática deve intervir ativamente nas eleições para deixar bastante claro que não existe qualquer programa de justiça climática a votos, para deixar claro que nas urnas e nos debates não só não estão as soluções da crise climática, como estas soluções estão a ser rejeitadas ativamente pelos aparelhos políticos e mediáticos. Tem de intervir para deixar claro que qualquer que seja o resultado, o rumo ao caos não terá sido alterado pelo novo colorido político.\n\nA polarização entre extrema-direita e extremo-centro, aquela que se desenha na maior parte das eleições deste ano, é um arranjo político para o suicídio civilizacional por causa da crise climática. Não há nenhuma política de transformação industrial e económica justa em cima da mesa por demissão da esquerda. Um campo anti-sistema pela justiça social e climática, que denuncie e se oponha ao debate suicida entre o centro e a extrema-direita é imprescindível e construí-lo é uma das tarefas mais urgentes do movimento pela justiça climática."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 0, "end": 98}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 37, "end": 98}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 101, "end": 172}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 451, "end": 538}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 642, "end": 996}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1001, "end": 1351}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1515, "end": 1650}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2182, "end": 2302}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 2418, "end": 2575}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 2579, "end": 2835}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2997, "end": 3071}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 3104, "end": 3438}], "article_id": "4388", "lang": "pt", "text": "Direitos sociais europeus no aborto: Portugal tem de garantir “rapidez, simplicidade e privacidade”\n\nPortugal está a violar os direitos sociais europeus na questão do aborto. Apesar da interrupção da gravidez até às 10 semanas ser um direito consagrado desde 2007, em várias zonas do país não há acesso a esse cuidado de saúde. Para o especialista em Saúde Internacional Tiago Correia, o problema não está na lei, não é restrito à região dos Açores e é urgente garantir “a rapidez, a simplicidade e sobretudo a privacidade do procedimento”.\n\n\"A lei demonstrou ter todos os mecanismos necessários para conseguir ser efetivamente implementada. Várias entidades na área da saúde ao longo destes anos, desde 2007, foram criando normas e orientações para afinar a lei no sentido de assegurar o seu eficaz cumprimento\", explica Tiago Correia.\n\nContudo, verifica-se que em 13 hospitais do Serviço Nacional de Saúde - quase um terço do total de 44 - não fazem interrupção da gravidez por vontade da mulher.\n\n“Vemos que há aqui um cumprimento das autoridades que fiscalizam a ação das autoridades de saúde, nomeadamente a Entidade Reguladora da Saúde, que tem emitido várias deliberações, muitas vezes punitivas, das organizações de saúde, do SNS, que não garantem o eficaz cumprimento desta lei, e estas punições coimas que podem ir dos 1.000 aos 44.000 euros”, esclarece o comentador da SIC.\n\nO professor de Saúde Internacional considera que a lei em Portugal “está bem blindada, mas não é claro o que está aqui em causa. Não se sabe exatamente porque é que há um número tão grande de hospitais onde não se realiza a Interrupção Voluntária da Gravidez (IVG)”.\n\nTiago Correia admite várias explicações para esta situação:\n\n“Pode ser por falta de recursos humanos, por objeção de consciência, que é um direito que a lei da IVG consagra, na medida em que os profissionais têm o direito de não querer realizar esse procedimento, mas a lei também é muito segura nas alternativas que dá às mulheres para que no caso desses profissionais que não queiram realizar esse procedimento, haver soluções que sejam rápidas, simples e que protejam a privacidade das mulheres”.\n\nO especialistas admite que os profissionais objetores de consciência “acabam por criar dificuldades às mulheres, acabam por puni-las, por julgá-las”.\n\nPunição de Itália vs Portugal\n\nTiago Correia explica que o Comité Europeu foi muito claro na punição de Itália. Portugal esteve alinhado nessas críticas, mas o número de hospitais que não realiza o procedimento é equivalente aquele que se verifica em território italiano.\n\n“Acho que há aqui uma certa hipocrisia das autoridades portuguesas por penalizar um estado membro da UE por fazer uma coisa que, pelos sinais que vamos tendo, revela que Portugal pune os outros, mas deixa que uma situação semelhante possa estar a acontecer”.\n\nDadas as circunstâncias, Portugal tem todas as condições para vir a ser condenado. “Não é uma lei com uma imposição legal, mas há aqui uma imposição tácita e há aqui um desrespeito que é uma má montra para Portugal no espaço europeu”, defende o comentador da SIC.\n\nAlerta para a lei da eutanásia\n\nTiago Correia realça ainda o “desleixo, despreocupação na implementação da lei, o que pode vir a acontecer com a lei da eutanásia” e sublinha a importância de garantir alternativas seguras e eficazes, no caso dos profissionais objetores de consciência impossibilitarem o acesso a estes cuidados de saúde.\n\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 0, "end": 84}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 509, "end": 581}, {"tag":

para assinalar os 17 anos do referendo para a despenalização do aborto e alertar para a necessidade do cumprimento da lei, através do SNS.\n\nCerca das 09h30, elementos do núcleo da cidade de Lisboa do Movimento Democrático de Mulheres (MDM) começaram a distribuir panfletos a mulheres que entravam ou saíam do hospital, sensibilizando-as para a importância de a lei ser cumprida em todo o país, uma ação que despertou a atenção de alguns jovens que quiserem perceber o que estava em causa.\n\n\"O objetivo da nossa ação é lembrar às pessoas, mas sobretudo às mulheres, que em 2007 o referendo para a despenalização da interrupção voluntária da gravidez [IVG] venceu e finalmente, depois de muitos anos de luta das mulheres, e, designadamente, do Movimento Democrático de Mulheres, conseguimos uma grande conquista\", disse à agência Lusa Fátima Amaral, dirigente nacional do MDM.\n\nFátima Amaral realçou que foi \"uma grande conquista\" em termos de as mulheres terem direito a decidir livremente, em consciência, poderem interromper a gravidez, através do Serviço Nacional de Saúde (SNS).\n\n\"Para nós é uma questão de saúde pública, mas também de direitos humanos\", vincou, declarando que o SNS tem de garantir este direito, em equidade, a todas as mulheres que queiram recorrer a uma IVG.\n\nSegundo a dirigente do MDM, a escolha do Hospital Santa Maria, em Lisboa, para fazer a ação \"não foi por acaso\", justificando que o seu serviço de interrupção voluntária da gravidez tem tido problemas \"de vez em quando\" nos últimos anos.\n\n\"Encerra, interrompe e envia mulheres que querem interromper a gravidez para o setor privado e, portanto, nós defendemos e estamos a chamar a atenção que é preciso que o Estado, designadamente quem está a governar, respeite aquilo que a lei consagra e, portanto, tem de haver mais médicos especializados para que haja mais consultas em que as mulheres rapidamente possam ter acesso\" à IVG, defendeu.\n\nPara Fátima Amaral, tem de haver uma melhoria de articulação entre os cuidados de saúde primários e as unidades hospitalares, bem como mais formação dos profissionais de saúde que estão na área da saúde sexual e reprodutiva.\n\nDefendeu também ser essencial que comece a haver nos cuidados de saúde primários a interrupção voluntária da gravidez através do método medicamentoso, que disse ser \"muito melhor para as mulheres, tem muito menos consequências\".\n\nAlém disso, os cuidados de saúde primários são \"um serviço de proximidade\" que também resolvia os problemas dos hospitais.\n\nO MDM salienta que \"as mulheres que precisam de realizar uma IVG veem-se muitas vezes confrontadas com dificuldades de articulação e disponibilização entre os diferentes níveis de cuidados do SNS, o que é inadmissível\".\n\nPara Fátima Amaral, o problema da aplicação da lei da IVG acompanha os obstáculos que têm sido criados no SNS, porque não tem havido o investimento necessário para reter os profissionais de saúde que emigram ou vão para o setor privado.\n\nSegundo a MDM, a escassez de especialistas e a existência de \"um número significativo de objetores de consciência\" fazem com que continue a aumentar o encaminhamento do SNS para o privado.\n\nDefendeu, por isso, que o SNS tenha políticas de investimento mais fortes e de atração dos seus profissionais.\n\nAlertou também para a necessidade de campanhas de informação pedagógicas, para as mulheres estrangeiras que vivem em Portugal.\n\n\"É um país de muita imigração (...) é necessário respeitar, por um lado, a multiplicidade das culturas, mas também é muito importante cada vez mais haver campanhas de informação pedagógicas para que as mulheres também conheçam os seus direitos e saibam onde se podem dirigir\",

Há décadas que nos vendem o sonho liberal, mas a vida da maioria está hoje pior. Os jovens emigram por causa dos baixos salários, da precariedade, da crise da habitação e do desinvestimento público.\n\nMais de metade dos jovens a trabalhar em Portugal admite emigrar, de acordo com uma sondagem recente da Aximage. Entre os mais de oitocentos jovens entre os 18 e os 34 anos que responderam ao inquérito, a instabilidade financeira e os problemas no acesso à habitação são os principais motivos de preocupação. Daí que os números da emigração mereçam maior atenção no debate público, principalmente em vésperas de eleições legislativas.\n\nA direita elegeu a emigração como um dos temas prioritários do seu discurso. Tanto o PSD como a Iniciativa Liberal se têm referido aos números da emigração como um reflexo do insucesso das “políticas socialistas”. Apontam o peso do Estado e dos impostos em Portugal como o principal fator responsável pela saída permanente de jovens. Este discurso é intuitivo e tem ganho adesão no debate, mas não sobrevive a um confronto sério com os factos. Vale a pena perceber porquê.\n\nA emigração é um problema novo?\n\nSe olharmos para os números da emigração permanente de portugueses, o que salta à vista é o enorme aumento registado entre 2011 e 2014 – isto é, durante o período do programa de ajustamento da troika e do governo PSD-CDS liderado por Pedro Passos Coelho. Com a crise em que o país mergulhou e as medidas de austeridade (que foram além do memorando da troika, relembre-se), o número de pessoas a procurar melhores condições de vida no estrangeiro mais do que duplicou. No caso da emigração jovem, o aumento foi ainda mais pronunciado em alguns grupos etários e profissões, como aconteceu com os enfermeiros acabados de se licenciar.\n\nA emigração chegou a ser incentivada pelo governo da altura como uma das soluções para quem não conseguia encontrar emprego, como aconteceu com os professores desempregados. Este incentivo foi feito num contexto em que a taxa de desemprego ultrapassou os 17%, uma das mais elevadas de sempre na história democrática do país. Passado esse período, a emigração diminuiu de forma considerável, tanto em termos totais como entre os jovens, embora, em termos totais, seja hoje mais elevada do que em 2008. Em todo o caso, a preocupação com a perda de jovens qualificados parece ser transversal, pelo que vale a pena analisar o fenómeno em detalhe.\n\nEm busca de menos impostos… ou de melhores salários?\n\nEntre os destinos da emigração portuguesa, França continua a ser o líder destacado, seguindo-se a Suíça, o Reino Unido e os EUA, onde existem comunidades portuguesas estabelecidas há muitos anos, segundo o Observatório da Emigração. O mesmo acontece no Canadá e no Brasil. Na Europa, destacam-se ainda Alemanha, Espanha e Luxemburgo.\n\nAs estimativas do observatório apontam para que os cinco principais destinos em 2022 tenham sido, por esta ordem, Espanha, Suíça, Reino Unido, Alemanha e Países Baixos ( ainda não existem dados para França, que deverá continuar no top 4).\n\nNo debate público, a saída de pessoas – sobretudo de jovens – tem sido atribuída pelos partidos de direita às “políticas socialistas” e, em especial, ao nível de fiscalidade no país. Há pelo menos dois argumentos relacionados com a fiscalidade: (1) os impostos sobre o trabalho (IRS) são demasiado elevados, o que explica a procura de outros destinos, e (2) o custo por trabalhador para as empresas é excessivo, o que impede o pagamento de melhores salários. Mas os dados disponíveis sobre impostos nos diferentes países não parecem validar esta hipótese.\n\nComecemos por olhar para a carga fiscal – isto é, a relação entre o total dos impostos e contribuições efetivas para a Segurança Social e o PIB. Os dados do Eurostat para os países da Europa mostram que, em 2022, a carga fiscal da economia portuguesa (35,8%) se encontrava bastante abaixo da média da União Europeia (39,9%) e da Zona Euro (40,5%), ficando abaixo da maioria dos destinos da emigração portuguesa – França (45,9%), Bélgica (42,6%), Alemanha (40,5%), Luxemburgo (38%), Países Baixos (38%) e Espanha (37,4%) – ficando apenas acima da Suíça (26,9%).\n\nSe recorrermos aos dados da OCDE, que não são exatamente iguais mas permitem comparações com os restantes países, o que vemos é que a carga fiscal em Portugal (36,4%) continua a ser inferior à dos países referidos e é quase a mesma que a do Reino Unido (35,3%), sendo superior à dos EUA.\n\nPassemos ao nível de tributação sobre o trabalho. A OCDE publica as estatísticas das taxas efetivas sobre o rendimento do trabalho (tax wedge), que incluem o imposto cobrado aos trabalhadores e as contribuições pagas pelos trabalhadores e pelas empresas para a Segurança Social. Vale a pena olhar com algum detalhe para este indicador.\n\nA primeira conclusão é que, em Portugal, o peso dos impostos e contribuições num salário médio continua a ser inferior a alguns dos principais destinos da nossa emigração (França, Alemanha ou Bélgica) e muito próximo de outros (Luxemburgo e Espanha). Há ainda outros aspetos que vale a pena destacar. Embora este indicador seja superior ao dos Países Baixos, isso não se deve aos impostos: a taxa efetiva de imposto sobre o salário médio é de 17,1% em Portugal e 16,1% nos Países Baixos. A diferença está nas contribuições para a Segurança Social. Embora a direita aposte na confusão das categorias, as contribuições não são impostos pagos ao Estado, mas sim o valor que descontamos para ter direito a uma pensão de reforma.\n\nA grande diferença está nos salários pagos. O salário médio ajustado em Portugal está claramente abaixo da média da União Europeia. Apesar de ser superior ao de vários países do Leste europeu e também ao da Grécia, cuja economia foi arrasada por uma intervenção da Troika ainda mais violenta do que a que ocorreu por cá, o salário médio português é significativamente mais baixo do que o de Espanha (país vizinho) e dos países do Norte, para onde os portugueses emigram.\n\nA estrutura salarial em Portugal continua a ser marcada pela prevalência de salários muito baixos. Mais de metade dos trabalhadores por conta de outrem recebe menos de €1000 por mês e essa percentagem é ainda maior no caso dos jovens. Neste cenário, não surpreende que boa parte dos jovens esteja descontente com as perspetivas com que se depara à entrada para o mundo do trabalho e que poucos dos que emigram optem por regressar, apesar dos benefícios fiscais que já existem para quem o faz.\n\nPorque temos salários tão baixos? \n\nSe o principal fator de descontentamento são os baixos salários, é preciso perceber o que explica este padrão salarial em Portugal. Há dois grandes motivos para a prevalência de remunerações baixas no país: o desempenho desapontante da economia portuguesa e o fosso que tem aumentado entre os salários e a produtividade. \n\n1. Uma economia estagnada \n\nA economia portuguesa encontra-se estagnada nos últimos 20 anos. A taxa média de crescimento anual não chegou a 1%, um valor manifestamente inferior ao que se registava nas décadas anteriores. O crescimento das economias é afetado por diversos fatores, mas as suas características estruturais costumam ser um fator decisivo. No caso português, é difícil não relacionar o fraco desempenho da economia ao longo das últimas duas décadas com o seu padrão de especialização: temos uma economia assente em setores de baixo valor acrescentado, intensivos em trabalho e com pouco potencial produtivo, bem como um atraso histórico na qualificação da população face à maioria dos países europeus.\n\nComo se chegou aqui? A adesão ao Euro trouxe uma moeda sobrevalorizada que favoreceu as importações e tornou mais caras (e, por isso, menos atrativas) as exportações para o resto do mundo. As entradas da China na Organização Mundial do Comércio e dos países de Leste na UE contribuíram para esta tendência, uma vez que se tornou cada vez mais difícil competir com países com salários muito baixos. Com a liberalização financeira e a equalização das taxas de juro à escala europeia, houve um enorme aumento do endividamento das empresas e das famílias em Portugal. A dívida externa líquida portuguesa passou de cerca de 16% do PIB em 1999 para mais de 100% no período em que o país foi intervencionado pela Troika (2011-2014).\n\nO investimento privado canalizou-se para setores como a construção, o imobiliário e, mais recentemente, para o turismo e a restauração. O mercado favoreceu estes setores por estarem menos expostos à concorrência internacional ou por assentarem em vantagens naturais do país e, por isso, permitirem maiores lucros no curto prazo. Mas há outros aspetos que estes setores têm em comum: baixo potencial produtivo, baixa incorporação de conhecimento e tecnologia, baixos salários e precariedade. A excessiva dependência deste tipo de setores é o principal fator de fragilidade da economia portuguesa, principalmente quando o motor da economia europeia, a Alemanha, está em recessão técnica em consequência da pandemia e da guerra na Ucrânia.\n\nA tendência de estagnação e especialização em serviços de baixo valor acrescentado está longe de ser um problema exclusivo da economia portuguesa. Na verdade, essa é uma tendência comum aos países do Sul da Europa, cujas características estruturais se assemelham mais às de Portugal. Com a adesão a uma moeda sobrevalorizada e a concorrência de países com salários bem mais baixos (China e Leste europeu), estes países perderam terreno nas exportações e o endividamento externo cresceu - e o crédito, proveniente da banca alemã, foi uma compensação financeira durante vários anos, até à crise das dívidas soberanas de 2010.\n\nQuando olhamos para os fluxos migratórios na União Europeia, é possível identificar um padrão: os países das periferias do Sul e de Leste têm perdido população nos últimos anos, ao passo que os países do Norte têm ganho. O principal destino da migração intra-UE é a Alemanha. Apesar de a direita apontar o crescimento dos países de Leste como casos de sucesso das políticas liberais, a verdade é que eles também não têm evitado a saída de pessoas — e a um ritmo superior ao nosso.\n\nO mercado único e, no caso da Zona Euro, a moeda única, ajudam a explicar este processo, como foi explicado pelo nobel da Economia Joseph Stiglitz, no seu livro O Euro – Como uma moeda comum ameaça o futuro da Europa: numa área que assegurou a mobilidade do fator trabalho, mas não a convergência económica entre os países e as suas economias, a tendência é que exista um fluxo de trabalhadores, sobretudo entre os mais qualificados, para as regiões mais desenvolvidas. A perda de jovens qualificados, por sua vez, atrasa o desenvolvimento dos países de origem e acentua a dinâmica de divergência.\n\n2. O fosso entre a produtividade e os salários\n\nO desempenho da economia portuguesa nos últimos vinte anos tem sido desapontante. Poder-se-ia pensar que é suficiente para explicar o fraco crescimento salarial. No entanto, a verdade é que os salários reais nem sequer têm acompanhado a evolução da produtividade, como demonstrado pelo economista Paulo Coimbra.\n\nÉ difícil não associar esta tendência à precarização do trabalho ao longo deste período. Depois das reformas da Troika, que incluíram a flexibilização dos despedimentos e a facilitação do recurso a contratos precários, Portugal tornou-se um dos países da União Europeia onde o recurso a contratos a termo é maior, sobretudo entre os jovens.\n\nApesar das alterações legislativas aprovadas desde o período da Troika, Portugal continua a ser um dos países da UE com maior peso de contratos precários, que abrangem quase metade dos jovens empregados, e é também o terceiro com mais emprego a termo involuntário, o que não impede a IL de continuar a dizer que precisamos de mais “flexibilidade” nos despedimentos.\n\nA precariedade teve um efeito de compressão nos salários, reconhecido por um estudo da Comissão Europeia que concluiu que existe um diferencial salarial entre contratos precários e permanentes e que este é maior nos países com maior percentagem de precários, como Portugal. Mais: um trabalho de investigação de três economistas do FMI aponta para a existência de uma relação entre a desregulação laboral e a redução da wage share – a fração do rendimento produzido numa economia que é recebida pelo fator trabalho, ou, por outras palavras, a fatia do bolo que cabe aos trabalhadores.\n\nO problema não está nos impostos, mas no que proporcionam \n\nApesar de a carga fiscal se encontrar abaixo da média europeia e de os impostos sobre os salários médios já terem diminuído nos últimos anos, a verdade é que o discurso sobre os “impostos elevados” continua a ser convincente para muitos. A combinação de salários relativamente baixos e serviços públicos cuja qualidade se tem deteriorado nos últimos anos é uma das razões para essa narrativa colher entre muitos portugueses. \n\nOs impostos são o preço que pagamos para viver numa sociedade decente. Os países escandinavos, onde os níveis de tributação são muito mais elevados, são os que reportam melhores índices de felicidade da população, precisamente porque, entre outras coisas, as pessoas têm acesso a serviços públicos de qualidade que melhoram o bem-estar coletivo. \n\nEm Portugal, apesar dos enormes avanços conseguidos desde o 25 de Abril de 1974, os últimos dez anos têm sido marcados por uma política de sub-investimento sistemático que degrada os serviços públicos. No Serviço Nacional de Saúde, o desinvestimento tem fragilizado o serviço público e levado muitas pessoas a optar pelos hospitais privados, onde os atos médicos são bastante mais caros. Nos transportes, o passe social foi uma medida positiva, mas a falta de investimento tem levado ao encerramento de várias linhas ferroviárias e à supressão sistemática de comboios ou autocarros, obrigando muitas pessoas a usar o automóvel próprio num contexto em que o preço dos combustíveis disparou. O desinvestimento público aumenta o custo de vida da maioria.\n\nO caso da habitação é talvez o mais visível no atual contexto. Sem nunca ter sido uma prioridade do investimento público, Portugal continua a ter um dos mais reduzidos parques habitacionais públicos da União Europeia. O Estado não só se demitiu do seu papel neste domínio como favoreceu a especulação do mercado: entre a liberalização do arrendamento, os vistos gold, os benefícios fiscais do regime de residentes não habituais (que oferece uma taxa de imposto de apenas 20%) e os benefícios fiscais a fundos de investimento, tudo contribuiu para alimentar a bolha que tem gentrificado as nossas cidades.\n\nA isto acrescenta-se a falta de regulação do alojamento local: em 2019, e em número de alojamentos locais, Lisboa ultrapassou Barcelona, uma das cidades com maior pressão turística do mundo. Há mais ALs per capita em Lisboa do que em Nova Iorque. Neste contexto, os preços da habitação cresceram muito acima dos salários de quem trabalha no país, pelo que não surpreende que Portugal seja o país da UE onde os jovens saem mais tarde de casa dos pais.\n\nBaixar impostos e esperar que chova? \n\nComo vimos, os jovens não emigram para destinos com impostos mais baixos, mas sim com salários mais altos, contratos mais estáveis e melhor qualidade de vida. Nesse sentido, os problemas do país prendem-se com o fraco desempenho da economia, com a precarização do trabalho e com o desinvestimento nos serviços públicos, o que torna o custo de vida mais caro. \n\nFace a este cenário, o que os partidos de direita oferecem é mais uma redução de impostos para as empresas, com a promessa de que trará mais crescimento e prosperidade. O problema é que, ao contrário do que muitos economistas afirmam frequentemente, não é isso que a evidência empírica nos diz. Os economistas Sebastian Gechert e Philipp Heimberger publicaram o estudo \"Os cortes de impostos para as empresas estimulam o crescimento económico?\", no qual analisam dezenas de estudos empíricos que usam diferentes indicadores, diferentes horizontes temporais e que relatam resultados muito diversos. A conclusão dos autores é que, ao contrário do que boa parte dos economistas insiste, não há evidência empírica que nos permita afirmar que esses cortes promovem o crescimento dos países que os aplicam.\n\nApesar da desinformação que tem marcado este debate, a taxa máxima de IRC em Portugal diz-nos muito pouco sobre o esforço fiscal das empresas, uma vez que é muito difícil (para não dizer impossível) encontrar uma empresa que pague mesmo essa taxa de imposto. A taxa geral de IRC é de 21% e a taxa efetiva de imposto – a média do que as empresas pagam efetivamente após isenções e benefícios fiscais – é de apenas 18,9%. \n\nCuriosamente, a lógica de diminuir os impostos para promover o crescimento salarial é a que foi implementada pelo governo do PS desde 2022, quando assinou o acordo de rendimentos com as confederações patronais e a UGT. As empresas que aumentem os salários em linha com as metas (reduzidas) já têm direito a uma redução do IRC. \n\nAlém de não resolver os problemas estruturais da economia portuguesa, a redução da tributação serve essencialmente para beneficiar os acionistas das empresas, enquanto o Estado abdica da receita fiscal com que se pode financiar os serviços públicos. Serve de pouco reduzir impostos se a perda de receita fiscal e o desinvestimento no Estado Social empurrar as pessoas para alternativas que rapidamente se tornam mais caras. \n\nA verdade é que a direita não está a falar para os jovens, mas para os ricos. Quando compara os impostos cobrados em Portugal, nos Países Baixos e na Irlanda sobre um salário mensal de €2000, esquece-se – ou omite – que essa não é a realidade da esmagadora maioria das pessoas no país. O discurso é orientado para a pequena fração de pessoas que ganha acima da média e para quem a emigração é uma hipótese de duplicar ou triplicar o salário, aproveitando para explorar o individualismo e minar o financiamento dos serviços públicos. \n\nPropostas como a da taxa única de IRS estão desenhadas para beneficiar sobretudo os mais ricos. De resto, a redução do IRS que foi aprovada pelo governo no Orçamento do Estado deste ano beneficia mais quem tem rendimentos mais elevados, de acordo com a avaliação do Banco de Portugal. Sem apresentar um programa alternativo, a direita propõe que se acentue ainda mais essa desigualdade.\n\nMudar de vida\n\nPortugal não atravessa uma vaga de emigração como as que se verificaram durante o Estado Novo e a guerra colonial ou no período de intervenção da Troika. Apesar disso, a preocupação com a saída de jovens do país é legítima, sobretudo por aquilo que ela nos diz sobre o modelo de crescimento da economia portuguesa na última década e sobre o seu posicionamento na Zona Euro\n\nDepois da intervenção da Troika, Portugal registou um crescimento relativamente mais elevado, mas isso deveu-se essencialmente à expansão de setores como o turismo, que têm pouco potencial produtivo, pagam salários baixos e estão associados à bolha imobiliária. Houve crescimento e criação de emprego, mas a precariedade alastrou-se, os rendimentos continuam a ser muito baixos. Houve progresso nas qualificações da população, mas os empregos com que os jovens se deparam continuam a ser maioritariamente precários e/ou mal pagos.\n\nAo contrário do que a direita tem dito, o problema dos salários baixos não se resolve reduzindo os impostos. O desenvolvimento do país e o crescimento sustentado dos salários dependem, pelo contrário, de um Estado mais interventivo na economia: na regulação do trabalho, para combater a precariedade que se vai alastrando, e na requalificação da economia portuguesa, apoiando setores de maior valor acrescentado e investindo em áreas como a habitação ou os transportes públicos, que melhoram a qualidade de vida da maioria e têm impactos positivos para a atividade económica.\n\nA ideia de que o “Estado mínimo” traz prosperidade não é nova. Depois de três décadas de desregulação do sistema financeiro, liberalização da lei laboral, redução do IRC e privatização de quase todos os sectores da economia, há quem queira convencer-nos que o problema do país é a falta de liberalismo e que a solução mágica é (mais) uma redução de impostos. Não será de desconfiar?\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 234, "end": 447}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 735, "end": 989}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 939, "end": 948}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Time", "start": 1259, "end": 1354}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1623, "end": 1829}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2389, "end": 2551}], "article_id": "4392", "lang": "pt", "text": "Parlamento português recomenda ao Governo que reconheça Estado da Palestina\n\nO texto final do projeto de resolução, apresentado pela comissão parlamentar de Negócios Estrangeiros e Comunidades Portuguesas, recomenda ao executivo que, “no quadro do processo de paz, dê os passos apropriados e necessários para que Portugal possa reconhecer, em estreita articulação com parceiros próximos no âmbito da UE, o Estado da Palestina, viável e sustentável”.\n\nA iniciativa, que resulta da articulação dos projetos do PS, PAN e Livre, teve hoje os votos favoráveis do PS, PSD, Iniciativa Liberal, Bloco de Esquerda, PAN e Livre, contra do Chega e a abstenção do PCP, numa votação em plenário da Assembleia da República.\n\nA resolução defende uma “repartição de território justa e mutuamente aceite”, de forma a garantir que a Palestina “possa viver lado a lado com o Estado de Israel, reconhecido e em paz e segurança, excluindo qualquer organização terrorista como representante do povo Palestiniano”.\n\nAtualmente, dos 193 países das Nações Unidas, 139 reconhecem o Estado da Palestina.

E por um psicólogo, se desejar.”\n\nDo outro lado do telefonema, a voz desta funcionária do Hospital do Divino Espírito Santo (HDES), em Ponta Delgada (Ilha de São Miguel, Açores), é profissional, atenta, sem pressa. Tudo parece estar ali a correr de acordo com o estipulado na lei que, em 2007, passou a permitir a interrupção da gravidez (IG) até às 10 semanas por decisão exclusiva da mulher  -  até no prazo de tempo entre o primeiro contacto com o SNS e a primeira consulta, que não pode exceder cinco dias (uma estipulação legal que é muito frequentemente violada no Serviço Nacional de Saúde, como o DN denunciou em investigação publicada a partir de fevereiro de 2023): “Se na ecografia se vir que tem embrião e uma gravidez viável, e está dentro do prazo, não espera mais de 48 horas pela consulta”, explica a amável assistente técnica do HDES.\n\nA conversa relatada tem lugar a 12 de dezembro de 2023, oito dias após a anunciada (pelo Governo Regional) reabertura, a 4 de dezembro, da consulta de IG -  que tinha fechado em 2021. Esse fecho, como o DN havia noticiado em maio, obrigava as mulheres de São Miguel (a maior ilha açoriana, com 140 mil habitantes) que queriam interromper a gravidez a fazer 1500 quilómetros até Lisboa, para ali obterem o procedimento numa clínica privada protocolada com os hospitais açorianos; em 2022, tal aconteceu com 80. O mesmo sucedia com as mulheres da Ilha Terceira, a segunda mais populosa do arquipélago (58 mil habitantes), cujo hospital também não realiza - e nunca realizou - interrupções de gravidez até às 10 semanas; em 2022, contabilizaram-se ali 38 IG protocoladas com a Clínica dos Arcos, em Lisboa.\n\nO único hospital das ilhas que efetuava este tipo de IG era, até outubro - quando também essa consulta fechou, por um dos dois médicos não-objetores ter declarado igualmente objeção de consciência (a lei em vigor exige que haja dois médicos no processo de IG) -, o Hospital da Horta, no Faial (14 500 habitantes), que serve também a população do Pico (13 700) e de São Jorge (8 300). Em 2022, fizeram-se na Horta 32 IG até às 10 semanas; no conjunto dos três hospitais, contabilizaram-se 150 nesse ano, a esmagadora maioria das quais - 118, ou 78,6% -, correspondentes a mulheres que tiveram de se deslocar a Lisboa para obterem um cuidado de saúde garantido pela Lei da República.\n\nA 8 de janeiro, pouco menos de um mês após o telefonema do DN para o HDES, era dada nota pública de que ali se tinham já realizado, desde 4 de dezembro, 16 interrupções de gravidez até às 10 semanas (das quais, segundo fonte do Hospital da Horta, “cinco ou seis” lhe corresponderão). Comparando com os números de 2022, parece existir um incremento. Se no resto do ano o ritmo for semelhante, contabilizar-se-ão 192 destas IG nos Açores; note-se que em 2011, quando o HDES começou a efetuar IG, o número global nos Açores subiu 14,6%, dos  178 de 2010 para 204.\n\n“A distância pode impedir as mulheres de abortar”\n\nClaro que a variação no número de interrupções se pode dever a muitos fatores, mas a reabertura da consulta de IG no hospital da maior ilha açoriana pode constituir aquilo que os cientistas denominam de “experiência natural”, e corroborar as conclusões do estudo realizado pelo economista António Melo para a sua tese de doutoramento: de que quanto mais longe se encontra uma região geográfica de um serviço que providencia interrupção de gravidez, menor a taxa deste cuidado de saúde na população dessa região.\n\n“Quanto mais longe, menos abortos”, resume este cientista ao DN. “A distância pode potencialmente impedir as mulheres de abortar. Haver pessoas que são impedidas de abortar por morarem no sítio errado.”\n\nEssa diminuição do número de abortos legais em função da distância ao serviço de IG foi quantificada pelo economista: “Os municípios portugueses que estão a mais de uma hora do serviço de IG mais próximo têm menos 22% de abortos que municípios que estão a até 30 minutos do serviço.” A distância, em tempo, mencionada é medida num trajeto de automóvel, podendo assim corresponder a uma muito maior (e mais penosa) distância temporal em transportes públicos.\n\nA taxa calculada está “controlada em termos do número de mulheres férteis [15/49 anos] por região”- não podendo assim ser atribuída ao facto de as populações mais distantes dos grandes centros, onde geralmente estão os hospitais, serem menos numerosas. Aliás, sem efetuar esse controlo, as diferenças são muito maiores, como se lê no  estudo: “84% dos abortos dizem respeito a mulheres que residiam a 30 ou menos minutos de um serviço de interrupção de gravidez, 13% às que residiam a entre 30 e 60 minutos, e 3% àquelas a mais de uma hora.”\n\nO período analisado inicia-se em 2008, logo após a legalização da IG por decisão exclusiva da mulher (que ocorreu em abril de 2007, na sequência do referendo de 11 de fevereiro desse ano) e termina em 2016. Isto porque a partir desse ano, alegando a entrada em vigor do Regulamento Geral de Proteção de Dados, a Direção-Geral da Saúde (DGS) deixou de publicar informação relativa à IG por hospital - não permitindo assim efetuar a correspondência entre cada serviço, a origem geográfica das mulheres, o tempo que esperaram pela primeira consulta e pelo procedimento, o prazo de gravidez e o tipo de aborto (medicamentoso ou cirúrgico).\n\nAo longo desse período, como o DN já noticiou, uma série de hospitais fecharam as respetivas consultas de IG. Esse facto é, informa António Melo, refletido no estudo: “O que encontrei foi precisamente que regiões onde se fecha o serviço de IG sofrem umas redução dos abortos legais, e que as mulheres aí residentes demoram a chegar ao contacto com um serviço onde haja consulta prévia [o nome dado na lei à primeira consulta do processo de IG, na qual é geralmente efetuada a datação da gravidez e dada toda a informação, após a qual é obrigatório esperar três dias (o chamado “período de reflexão”) até ao procedimento abortivo].” Contacto esse, lembra o cientista, “que pode não ser o primeiro que tiveram com o SNS; podem ter andado a bater às portas erradas até as encaminharem para o sítio onde podem abortar.” \n\nTrata-se da primeira análise em Portugal (e, crê o autor, na Europa) do efeito da dificuldade de acesso, em função da distância geográfica/temporal, na taxa de interrupção de gravidez legal. É o tema do paper “Todas as estradas levam ao mesmo destino? Proximidade a serviços de aborto, abortos e respetivas condições em Portugal”, que submeteu para publicação no Journal of Population Economics  e que corresponde à primeira parte da sua tese de doutoramento, efetuada na Universidade de Paris-Dauphine e defendida a 13 de outubro de 2023.\n\nUm dos fatores que, sublinha esta análise, preponderará na diminuição da taxa de aborto em função da distância aos serviços que os providenciam é o curtíssimo prazo legal imposto para a IG por decisão exclusiva da mulher (o menor na Europa; por exemplo em Espanha o prazo é de 14 semanas): “Com apenas 10 semanas para se abortar legalmente, os atrasos que observamos na chegada aos serviços podem explicar por que motivo as regiões com menor acesso à interrupção de gravidez têm taxas mais baixas -  as mulheres podem estar a requerer este cuidado de saúde demasiado tarde para ser autorizado e, consequentemente, levar as gravidezes a termo.”\n\nOu, lembra o DN, a interromper a gravidez pelos seus próprios meios, ou seja, ilegalmente - uma possibilidade que continua a existir (voltaremos a ela mais à frente). Até porque o economista reconhece não ter quantificado especificamente “uma transmissão total de aborto para fecundidade”, não sendo assim “garantido que todas as mulheres que quereriam abortar legalmente não tenham conseguido abortar”.\n\nAcesso mais difícil produz mais maternidade adolescente?\n\nO que o estudo analisa,  frisa o autor, é número de gravidezes adolescentes - soma dos abortos efetuados por adolescente mais o de mães adolescentes - contabilizadas por município, total que se mantém constante independentemente da distância a um serviço de IG. \nO motivo da escolha da gravidez adolescente, explica-se no paper, é o facto de se partir do princípio de que uma gravidez na adolescência é indesejada, permitindo assim entender o efeito na contraceção da distância para um serviço de IG. Isto para despistar a hipótese de que a existência de uma taxa de aborto menor nos locais mais longínquos se devesse ao facto de que, sabendo ter mais dificuldade no acesso ao aborto, as mulheres recorressem mais à contraceção. O que não aparenta ser o caso.\n\nMas, adverte  António Melo, se o número de grávidas adolescentes se mantém constante, independentemente de estarem perto ou longe de um serviço de IG, enquanto existem menos abortos à medida que a distância para um serviço aumenta, “quer em princípio dizer que há uma substituição de aborto por gravidez levada a termo (mais nascimentos) à medida que a distância para um serviço aumenta.”\n\nA taxa dessa substituição não está porém, esclarece, quantificada para a gravidez adolescente: “Não se pode retirar diretamente  da minha análise que há menos aborto adolescente à medida que a distância ao serviço mais próximo aumenta. Mas se seguirem o padrão geral, então, de facto, haverá mais mães adolescentes à medida que nos afastamos do serviço de IG.”\n\nUma vez mais, o caso dos Açores, não incluídos neste estudo, que trabalhou apenas com dados do Continente, poderá, face à reabertura da consulta de IG na mais populosa ilha do arquipélago, constituir uma “experiência natural” também para o efeito da proximidade de serviços na gravidez adolescente. Tanto mais que estas ilhas apresentam a mais alta taxa de fecundidade adolescente do país: em 2022, foi ali de 10,9 por mil adolescentes; o total nacional é de quase metade (6,2), sendo 6,1 no Continente e 3,6 na Madeira (onde existe um serviço de IG desde 2008).\n\nEm 2022, a média nacional de IG adolescente foi de 8,6%. O DN não encontrou dados de 2022 relativos à interrupção de gravidez adolescente nos Açores (236 413 habitantes); na Madeira (253 945 habitantes), no mesmo ano, 10,7% das IG (24) ocorreram com adolescentes. Do total de 224 IG até às 10 semanas ali contabilizadas no período, oito ocorreram com menores de 18 ; 16 tinham entre 18 e 19.\n\nUma vez que, quando há dificuldade de acesso, ela é ainda mais penalizadora para as jovens - têm por definição menos autonomia e disponibilidade económica -, o facto de até 4 de dezembro, para a maioria das habitantes do arquipélago (de São Miguel e Terceira), o acesso à IG se fazer mediante viagem para Lisboa terá em princípio significado, em linha com os resultados da investigação de António Melo, que naquele território e nessa faixa etária em específico houve uma taxa de abortos inferior à potencial. O economista assente: “Se o caso do Continente é grave em termos de dificuldade de acesso, nos Açores haveria decerto atrasos muito maiores.”\n\nMaior distância, abortos mais tardios - e mais cirúrgicos\n\nComo o título indica, o estudo de António Melo também se debruça sobre as condições em que os abortos ocorrem, quer no que respeita ao tempo de gravidez, quer ao tipo de procedimento. \n\n“Demonstramos que mulheres que vivem mais longe de um serviço de IG abortam com mais semanas de gravidez e que esse facto é, sobretudo, causado por chegarem tarde aos serviços, possivelmente devido a não saberem como aceder-lhes”, reporta o estudo. “Estimamos que as mulheres que vivem a entre 30 e 60 minutos de um serviço de IG têm uma probabilidade 140% maior de abortar depois das nove semanas e que essa probabilidade é ainda maior - 157% - para as que vivem a mais de uma hora.”\n\nOs atrasos em causa, que potencialmente correspondem a um maior risco para a saúde das mulheres, podem também, lê-se, ter repercussões em outros aspetos do processo abortivo, nomeadamente onde e como os abortos decorrem. “Os hospitais públicos que atendem as mulheres que estão perto do final do prazo podem ter dificuldade em providenciar a interrupção no tempo necessário (…) obrigando-os a contratar o serviço no privado, onde 97% do aborto é cirúrgico [ao contrário do SNS, no qual a esmagadora maioria dos abortos são medicamentosos]. Tudo leva a crer que é esse o motivo pelo qual é mais provável que as mulheres que vivem mais longe dos serviços públicos onde se fazem IG sejam encaminhadas para clínicas privadas e façam abortos cirúrgicos.”\n\nEncontrou-se assim uma correlação positiva entre o tempo de viagem até ao hospital com serviço de aborto e a probabilidade de o aborto ser efetuado numa clínica privada. “A proporção de abortos encaminhados para clínicas privadas [no caso, clínica privada, no singular, uma vez que em Portugal só existem dois serviços não-públicos licenciados para fazer IG e apenas um deles tem protocolos com hospitais do Serviço Nacional de Saúde: a Clínica dos Arcos, em Lisboa] aumenta de 21% entre mulheres que vivem até 30 minutos de um serviço com IG para 37% entre mulheres que vivem a uma hora de viagem. Do mesmo modo, a proporção de IG cirúrgica aumenta de 31% entre as mulheres que residem a 30 minutos de um serviço de IG para 44% naquelas que enfrentam tempos de viagem superiores a uma hora.”\n\nEm geral, assume o economista, as conclusões do estudo não foram exatamente uma surpresa: “No Texas e no Wisconsin, ainda antes da decisão de 2022 do Supremo Tribunal [revogando a decisão de 1973 que declarou o aborto um direito constitucionalmente protegido], se aprovaram leis para fechar as clínicas de aborto e os efeitos, que foram objeto de análise semelhante a esta, não são muito diferentes daqueles que encontramos em relação a Portugal.” \n\nSendo que, sublinha, existem várias diferenças entre os dois países. Desde logo, o facto de nos Estados Unidos a maioria das IG se efetuarem em clínicas privada e de o prazo permitido para o procedimento ser muito maior. Mas também, refere, os dados de que os cientistas ali dispõem são de muito menor qualidade que os portugueses: “Há que dizer que os dados da DGS são fantásticos, muito completos.”\n\nUma diferença interessante entre o estudo português e os americanos é que, lê-se no primeiro, “enquanto estes estudos concluem que a magnitude do efeito [decréscimo das taxas de aborto à medida que a distância para os serviços aumenta] se vai esbatendo com uma maior distância para os serviços, nós vemos o oposto - o impacto é ainda maior quando os municípios estão já longe.” Ou seja, em Portugal, quanto mais afastadas as mulheres estão de um serviço de IG, maior o impacto desse afastamento na sua capacidade de aceder a um aborto seguro.\n\nEsta discriminação em função da localização geográfica comprova que, como o DN já reportou (em maio de 2023, partindo do exemplo extremo dos Açores), a situação de Portugal no que respeita ao acesso à IG legal é muito semelhante à de Itália, país que foi já por duas vezes, em 2014 e 2016, alvo de condenação pelo Comité Europeu dos Direitos Sociais. Este organismo do Conselho da Europa, que tem a incumbência de fiscalizar o respeito dos Estados-membros pela Carta Social Europeia, considerou que o facto de naquele país 35% dos hospitais (em Portugal são 30%) não providenciarem IG alegando objeção do corpo clínico viola o direito à saúde das mulheres, discriminando-as com base na sua pertença de género, assim como social e  territorial.\n\n“As mulheres que procuram serviços de aborto podem encontrar, na prática, dificuldades substanciais na obtenção desse acesso, apesar de a lei o garantir (…). Em alguns casos, dado o caráter urgente dos procedimentos, as mulheres que desejam interromper a gravidez podem ser forçadas a procurar outros serviços de saúde, em Itália ou no estrangeiro (…), ou a interromper a gravidez sem o apoio e o controlo das autoridades de saúde competentes, (…) ou ser de todo impedidas de aceder aos serviços de aborto a que têm direito legal”, concluiu o Comité, considerando que essas situações “podem envolver riscos consideráveis para a saúde e o bem-estar das mulheres em causa”, violando assim o seu direito à saúde.\n\n“Quem tem dinheiro consegue sempre, o problema é sempre para as mesmas”\n\n“Creio que mesmo para alguém que seja contra o aborto é impossível justificar que uma mulher de Lisboa possa abortar e uma em Portalegre não”, comenta António Melo. “E claro que quem tem dinheiro consegue sempre, o problema é sempre para as mesmas - as pessoas com mais dificuldades económicas, as mais jovens.” \n\nAtualmente na Universidade de Turim (Itália), o economista, de 29 anos, tinha começado por se interessar pelo tema da interrupção de gravidez porque, conta, leu um estudo americano “que demonstrava que a legalização do aborto baixava o crime e pensei que seria interessante ver o que tinha acontecido em Portugal”. \n\nPorém ao começar a investigar, dando-se conta de que “havia uma falta de acesso no interior e Alentejo” foi-se afastando daquela abordagem. “Percebi que apesar de Portugal ser um país pequeno e de a lei ter como objetivo que o aborto legal seja acessível a todas as mulheres, há grandes diferenças no acesso, que podem implicar que a lei não esteja a ser cumprida.”\n\nAs conclusões deste estudo são mais uma peça do puzzle  que ao longo de 2023 se foi construindo na sequência da já citada investigação do DN sobre o acesso ao aborto legal no SNS. Particularmente relevantes para o descortinar dessa realidade foram as auditorias efetuadas pela Entidade Reguladora da Saúde (ERS) e a Inspeção-Geral das Atividades em Saúde (IGAS) sobre esse mesmo acesso, e cujos relatórios, noticiados pelo DN em setembro de 2023, dão a ver a existência, no SNS, de uma percentagem altíssima - superior a 80%- de médicos objetores de consciência para a interrupção de gravidez por decisão exclusiva da mulher, facto que os hospitais alegam para não terem consulta de IG. \n\nAcresce que, como o DN relatou através do contacto direto com os hospitais assumindo o papel de uma mulher que queria abortar, além da dificuldade em chegar ao número certo ou ao serviço adequado - muitos hospitais não ostentam nos respetivos sites informação sobre IG (uma falta apontada pela IGAS no seu relatório) -, em vários deles ninguém parecia saber como (ou queria) orientar quem inquiria; como comentou uma das entrevistadas, tudo parece pensado para desencorajar. O DN deparou-se até com uma funcionária que assegurou não ser possível, naquele estabelecimento (o Hospital da Guarda), “fazer isso”, por ser “um hospital amigo dos bebés”.\n\nNoutra das situações reportadas pelo DN, entre o primeiro contacto com o SNS e o procedimento, que ocorreu numa clínica privada (por encaminhamento do hospital), passaram quase três semanas, implicando quatro viagens de 80 quilómetros para a frente e para trás. E uma mulher que estava, em fevereiro de 2023, a tentar efetuar uma IG no SNS viu-se obrigada, por estar a aproximar-se o fim do prazo legal, a fazê-lo a suas expensas no privado.\n\n58 inquéritos de aborto ilegal desde 2020\n\n“Uma corrida de obstáculos”, foi como uma  entrevistada resumiu o que sentiu na sua demanda de um cuidado de saúde garantido na lei.\n\nSentimento que os números oficiais revelam ser certeiro em relação a pelo menos um quinto das mulheres: de acordo com o relatório da DGS relativo a 2022, 5% das mulheres que conseguiram interromper legalmente a gravidez nesse ano tiveram de esperar entre 11 e 15 dias pela primeira consulta; 20% esperaram acima do máximo de cinco dias estipulados na lei para essa espera. Sendo que, como vários médicos frisaram ao jornal, essas contagens pecam por defeito: a maioria das mulheres não contabiliza os dias que levou até obter uma marcação. \n\nRecorde-se que quando em fevereiro de 2023 o DN revelou o calvário que muitas mulheres enfrentam para aceder ao aborto legal, o ministro da Saúde garantiu que os problemas de acesso seriam resolvidos em meras semanas. Porém nenhuma medida foi desde então anunciada; até janeiro de 2024, nenhum serviço hospitalar ou centro de saúde continental abriram ou reabriram consulta de IG. Só nos Açores, como relatado no início deste texto, e já no final de 2023, foi reaberta uma consulta de IG. Mas tal sucedeu na sequência do fecho, um mês antes, da consulta de outro hospital do arquipélago, o da Horta.\n\nUm dos possíveis efeitos destas dificuldades - e até impossibilidades -, de acesso ao aborto no SNS é, como apontou o Comité Europeu dos Direitos Sociais nas citadas duas condenações que deliberou aplicar à Itália, o recurso ao aborto clanabdestino. Mas, como releva António Melo, “é muito difícil extrapolar com rigor a dimensão do aborto ilegal”. \n\nAté porque, como vários médicos têm vindo a apontar ao DN, aquele que é historicamente o principal indicador da IG ilegal - as complicações abortivas que dão entrada nas Urgências - não tem tido alterações assinaláveis. Tal pode dever-se, aventam os mesmos clínicos, ao acesso ilegal a medicamentos abortivos que, sendo seguros em interrupções precoces, permitem que o aborto clandestino permaneça invisível quer para o SNS, quer para a investigação criminal.\n\nPerguntada pelo DN sobre o número de processos relacionados com suspeita de crime de aborto ilegal desde 2008, a Procuradoria-Geral da República indicou, em resposta, dados entre 2020 e 2022. Nesse período, informa, foram abertos 58 inquéritos com essas características, sendo arquivados 39 e suspensos provisoriamente 10. Seis - dos quais quatro abertos em 2022- estão ainda em investigação; três inquéritos, um relativo a cada ano, tiveram despacho de acusação.\n"}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2, "end": 17}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 682, "end": 704}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 739, "end": 764}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 824, "end": 840}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 900, "end": 919}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 970, "end": 991}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 1033, "end": 1051}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1054, "end": 1122}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1073, "end": 1081}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1111, "end": 1121}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1126, "end": 1225}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1571, "end": 1579}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1588, "end": 1733}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1654, "end": 1665}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1882, "end": 1902}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 1925, "end": 1965}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 2399, "end": 2432}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2482, "end": 2526}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2494, "end": 2502}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2572, "end": 2650}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 2690, "end": 2726}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2732, "end": 2756}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 2871, "end": 2955}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2902, "end": 2921}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3083, "end": 3300}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3319, "end": 4045}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 3351, "end": 3363}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 3996, "end": 4045}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4049, "end": 4161}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 4163, "end": 4225}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 4228, "end": 4341}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 4354, "end": 4430}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 4515, "end": 4674}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4518, "end": 4564}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4582, "end": 4597}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 4831, "end": 5038}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 5145, "end": 5154}], "article_id": "4395", "lang": "pt", "text": "O aborto climático\n\nNo pretérito dia 6 de Dezembro dirigia-me, pelas 08:10, para uma das placas de estacionamento do Aeródromo de Tires (da responsabilidade da Câmara Municipal de Cascais) a fim de efectuar um voo de instrução com um aluno de uma das várias escolas de pilotagem existentes no aeródromo (e existem cerca de duas dezenas de outras empresas na mesma área).\n\nFui então informado de que, por razões desconhecidas, a Torre não estava a autorizar qualquer avião a pôr em marcha; não havia estimativa para quando tal seria possível e que se devia contactar as “operações do aeródromo” para futuras informações.\n\nMas pouco depois (“hélas”) já se sabia o motivo: um grupo de “activistas climáticos” – quem teria inventado este nome aparentemente respeitável? – tinha entrado no aeródromo, cortado a rede de segurança (um acto ilícito); chegado perto de um jacto particular de pequena dimensão (outro acto ilícito); pintado o avião com uma qualquer tinta vermelha (mais um acto ilícito), após o que se acorrentaram à aeronave (idem para o ilícito, com laivos de acto histérico – ou será uma nova forma de masoquismo?).\n\nPresume-se que as forças de segurança presentes no aeródromo tenham actuado conforme o regulamentado e como se tratava de uma ocorrência que punha em causa a segurança do mesmo e não se sabendo, na altura, a sua extensão e gravidade, parou-se toda a actividade aérea e não sei se mais alguma outra.\n\nPelas 09:20 apareceu uma equipa especial de intervenção da PSP a fim de melhor se lidar com a ocorrência. Seguiu-se a costumeira apresentação da rapaziada detida à autoridade judicial adequada ao caso, a qual por norma envia os “activistas” para casa na paz do senhor, a aguardar uma qualquer acção posterior.\n\nPassados uns dias a cena repete-se algures.\n\nA comunicação social faz ampla cobertura do ocorrido, tendo o cuidado de passar as mensagens destes transtornados mentais, ao mínimo pormenor. Estão, pois, a colaborar com a infracção…\n\nAs operações de voo no aeródromo foram retomadas pelas 10:00 h. No entretanto, foram cancelados ou retardados dezenas de voos e é possível que alguns aviões que se dirigissem ao aeródromo tenham tido de divergir para outros locais.\n\nNão fui indagar se outras actividades foram prejudicadas, mas de tudo resultaram prejuízos bastantes; missões que não se cumpriram; alteração do fluir normal da vida; distracção de meios policiais, enfim, a perda de tempo e dinheiro.\n\nQuem vai indemnizar pelos prejuízos causados? Os pais dos imberbes? Naturalmente que deviam; a autarquia? E quem indemniza a autarquia? A direcção do aeródromo por não conseguir garantir a segurança das instalações? Hum, difícil de acontecer; além disso o ónus deve ser colocado no infractor. Os “delinquentes” climáticos (um nome que lhes assenta melhor)? Duvido, podiam trabalhar toda a vida, que não ganhariam para tal. Além do que com o actual sistema judicial, altamente permissivo, nada se consegue que jeito tenha. Vai ser considerado um “azar” derivado de imponderáveis que não dominamos? Provavelmente, apesar de não caber nesse âmbito…\n\nÉ, pois, fundamental que todos os prejudicados apresentem queixa nas instâncias competentes a fim de serem ressarcidos dos prejuízos que tiveram e se faça Justiça e não se ande sempre no exercício deletério do Direito…\n\nEstamos perante um comportamento de um grupo de “fanatizados” por uma causa que mal entendem, organizados numa coisa chamada “climáximo” ao que parece maioritariamente constituído por menores que, em vez de estarem na escola a aprender algo de útil (tarefa difícil de realizar nos dias que correm…); fazer desporto, divertirem-se, crescerem e prepararem-se para a dureza da vida que vão enfrentar dentro em breve, andam entretidos a tentar fazer a vida negra ao comum dos cidadãos na esperança – infantil – de que vão mudar o mundo ou parar as eventuais alterações do clima. E, sem darem conta, andam a ajudar os “lobbies” dos negócios relacionados com a chamada “transição energética”! E que tudo o que andam a fazer se vai voltar contra eles.\n\nSerá que não lhes passa pela cabeça que os protestos devem ser feitos dentro da lei e sem prejudicarem terceiros? A situação resolvia-se facilmente com alguns tabefes e palmadas, se é que têm superfície corporal desenvolvida suficiente para os suportar e uns meses de trabalho comunitário duro (já agora, não ficava mal serem proibidos de viajar de avião durante meia dúzia de anos) ao mesmo tempo que se metia na prisão (uma prisão, não um hotel de três estrelas…) os putativos grupelhos políticos ditos de esquerda (melhor dizendo “esquerdopatas”) que lhes andam a lavar o cérebro e depois os enviam para a “cabeça do touro”.\n\nE não seria má ideia, também, ponderar-se a proibição de participação em qualquer manifestação pública de qualquer cidadão com menos de 18 anos.

Сградата в източната част на столицата на Германия, използвана като щаб на Червената армия, където Върховното командване на Вермахта капитулира пред Съветския съюз. Преди делегацията на нацистка Германия да подпише акта за безусловна капитулация пред представителите на СССР, САЩ, Великобритания и Франция, се случи интересно събитие. \r\nВиждайки френското знаме в залата и френското висше командване на масата, германският маршал Вилхелм Кайтел не издържа и подигравателно попита: „И тези ли ни победиха?“ Разбира се, Франция е сред страните победителки благодарение на съветския лидер Йосиф Сталин. Да, френските пилоти се биеха на страната на Съветите срещу нацистите, някои от тях загинаха героично. \r\nНо също така знаем, че френски формирования в редиците на нацистката армия са извършвали убийства на територията на Съветския съюз. Защо се сетих за всичко това… Откакто започна руската специална военна операция в Украйна, Франция напада Русия все по-яростно. А понякога дори минава всякакви граници. \r\nТези дни в телеграм канала на Министерството на отбраната на Русия се появиха свидетелства на пленени военнослужещи от Въоръжените сили на Украйна и тези свидетелства са много показателни. \r\nСпоред разказите на украинските войници, френските инструктори са ги карали да убиват колкото се може повече руски войници и са им насаждали ненавист към руския народ. Това е нечовешко, това е голямо престъпление. Наистина, в резултат на такава подготовка се разпалват вражда, омраза и кръвопролития. Вместо да се бори със собствените си проблеми, Франция се намесва във вътрешните работи на други страни, преди всичко на Русия. \r\nВ тази връзка най-твърдият и логичен отговор на Париж дойде от официалния представител на руското външно министерство Мария Захарова. Тя препоръча на френското ръководство да вкара в дневния ред на срещата на върха на НАТО, която ще се проведе на 11-12 юли във Вилнюс, вътрешнополитическата ситуация във Франция, където властта и обществото са в пълен разкол, а самата република „се тресе“ от вълнения от няколко години. \r\nОфициалният представител на руското външно министерство остро разкритикува изявленията на Еманюел Макрон за Русия и обобщи ситуацията във Франция, отбелязвайки: „Може би партньорите и съюзниците ще помогнат: те ще доставят на Франция оръжия с обеднен уран, за да защитят полицията от народа или народа от полицията – решението зависи от вас. \r\nМежду другото, ние се борим с противник, а вие във Франция се биете помежду си. Така че, преди да се опитвате да ни лекувате, излекувайте себе си.» Мисля, че Франция също трябва да „лекува“ собствената си памет, за да не забравя доброто, което СССР направи за нея.

Това каза икономическият експерт Кузман Илиев по bTV по повод изявленията на служебния кабинет за сваляне на цените на основни хранителни продукти.\r\nПо думите единственото, което може да направи властта, са условия, които да направят българските производители и предприемачи конкурентноспособни. А това, което може да свали цените, е поведението на потребителите, които започват да купуват по-малко, когато не могат да си позволят високата цена.\r\n\"Идеята е да се намали социалното напрежение и на хората да им се хвърли нали някаква такава димка, че видите ли ние правим нещо\", допълни икономистът по повод мерките на служебния кабинет.\r\nЕто какво още обясни той:\r\nГоворим за \"спадове на инфлацията\", но реално цените продължават да нарастват, но просто с малко по-бавен темп - поне статистически гледано. Привидната битка с инфлацията е важна политически: първо, за да се успокои общественото недоволство от стопяване на доходите. Второ, да се види от партньорите ни, че правим необходимото да отговорим на критерия за инфлация по пътя към еврото.\r\nДоходите обаче се топят мощно, а забавянето на инфлацията е неизбежно поради забавянето и на глобалната икономика, изразяващо се в анемичен или “отрицателен растеж”, ерго рецесия. Забавя се и темпът на ръст на паричното предлагане навсякъде, което също е предвестник именно на рецесия.\r\nСкритият инфлационен данък удря най-бедните най-тежко, а българите дават средно 1/3 от бюджета си за храни. Причините за инфлация обаче сега се удобно замъглени - налетите трилиони и безумната енергийна политика, - а фокусът се насочва към симптомите.\r\nУ нас основен фактор бе дълговото фискалното харчене през заплати и социални плащания, което засилваше инфлация в ущърб на най-уязвимите групи, от една страна. От друга, ние сме 2.5-3 пъти по-енергоемки от нашите конкуренти и историческата енергийна криза логично ни удря най-тежко.\r\nДългосрочното решение е спиране на допинга - печатницата за пари - и устойчиво създаване на енергиен капацитет, а не социални експерименти от рубриката “Зелена сделка”. Повече инвестиции и производство, по-малко политизиране на икономическите отношения.\r\nБезплодни и вредни акции, граничещи с административен произвол, няма да направят така, че да произвеждаме повече, нито да има инвестиции и да растат доходите. Ниските реални доходи по естествен път ще регулират свръхвисоките цени, нормализирайки разходите за живот. Реален ръст на заплатите има само, като създаваме нормални условия за предприемачи и бизнес и оттам расте производителността.\r\nПроблемът обаче трябва да се решава в основата му - ПР акциите не дават системни решения, а само влошават бизнес средата за домакинства и бизнес."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 28, "end": 41}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 28, "end": 41}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 240, "end": 249}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 332, "end": 400}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 332, "end": 400}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 649, "end": 665}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 669, "end": 851}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 714, "end": 818}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 857, "end": 895}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 900, "end": 998}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 955, "end": 998}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 1001, "end": 1072}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 1144, "end": 1343}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1187, "end": 1196}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 1230, "end": 1343}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 1689, "end": 1729}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1732, "end": 1886}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 1892, "end": 2161}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2164, "end": 2190}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2164, "end": 2190}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2194, "end": 2224}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2198, "end": 2224}, {"tag": "Straw_Man", "start": 2227, "end": 2337}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 2340, "end": 2372}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2375, "end": 2482}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 2488, "end": 2691}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 2644, "end": 2691}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2818, "end": 2844}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2818, "end": 2844}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 2874, "end": 3020}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 2879, "end": 2905}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 2879, "end": 2905}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3327, "end": 3440}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3362, "end": 3440}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3362, "end": 3374}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 3443, "end": 3464}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3568, "end": 3680}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 3568, "end": 3680}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 3707, "end": 3736}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3739, "end": 3865}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 3869, "end": 3932}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 3934, "end": 4042}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 4166, "end": 4215}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 4235, "end": 4280}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 4235, "end": 4243}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 4283, "end": 4328}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 4496, "end": 4605}], "article_id": "4113", "lang": "bg", "text": "Кои теми засегна Байдън във важната си реч “За състоянието на съюза”\r\n\r\nПрезидентът призова републиканците към съвместна работа.\r\n\r\nАмериканският президент Джо Байдън приветства възстановяването на американската икономика и създаването на  рекордните 12 милиона работни места в речта си “За състоянието на съюза”, като същевременно призова републиканците да спрат да се “борят в името на самата битка”.\r\nПървото обръщение на Байдън към Конгреса , след като републиканците поеха контрола над Камарата на представителите, следваше темите, на които той многократно се е спирал от началото на мандата си, информира bg-voice. Ето някои откъси от речта.\r\nАмерика, великата\r\n“Историята на Америка е история на прогреса и ние сме единствената страна, която е излизала от всяка криза по-силни, отколкото когато сме влизали в нея. Това е, което ние правим отново.”\r\n“Днес COVID вече не контролира живота ни. А преди две години нашата демокрация беше изправена пред най-голямата заплаха след Гражданската война. Днес, макар и наранена, нашата демокрация остава непоклатима и несломима.”\r\nИкономиката на САЩ\r\n“Преди две години икономиката ни се задъхваше. Когато стоя тук тази вечер, ние създадохме рекордните 12 милиона нови работни места – повече работни места, създадени за две години, отколкото който и да е президент някога е създавал за четири години. Преди две години COVID беше затворил нашите предприятия, затвори училищата ни и ни лиши от толкова много неща.”\r\n“Моят икономически план е за инвестиране в места и хора, които са били забравени. На фона на икономическите сътресения през последните четири десетилетия, твърде много хора бяха изоставени или третирани като че ли са невидими.”\r\n“Може би това сте вие, които гледате вкъщи. Спомняте си работните места, които изчезнаха. И се чудите дали изобщо съществува път за вас и децата ви да вървите напред без да се преместите. Разбирам ви.”\r\n“Ето защо изграждаме икономика, в която никой не е изоставен. Работните места се завръщат, гордостта се завръща благодарение на изборите, които направихме през последните две години. Това е план за възстановяване на Америка и постигане на реална промяна във вашия живот.”\r\nМоите приятели републиканци\r\n“Към моите приятели републиканци, ако можехме да работим заедно в предишния Конгрес, няма причина да не можем да работим заедно и в новия Конгрес. Хората ни изпратиха ясно послание. Да се борим за заради борбата, власт заради властта, конфликти заради самите конфликти, не ни води до никъде.”\r\n“И това винаги е било моето виждане за страната: да възстановим душата на нацията, да възстановим гръбнака на Америка: средната класа, да обединим страната. Ние сме изпратени тук, за да довършим работата!”\r\n“Вече сме финансирали над 20 000 проекта, включително в големи летища от Бостън до Атланта и Портланд… Искрено благодаря на моите приятели републиканци, които гласуваха за закона. А на моите приятели републиканци, които гласуваха против него, но все пак искат да финансираме проекти в техните райони, казвам не се притеснявайте.

Инсулинът съществува от 100 години.\r\nПроизводството му струва на фармацевтичните компании само 10 долара за флакон. Но големите фармацемтични компании несправедливо таксуват хората със стотици долари – и реализира рекордни печалби. Повече няма да е така… Да ограничим цената на инсулина на 35 долара месечно за всеки американец, който се нуждае от него.”\r\n“Големите корпорации не само се възползват от данъчния кодекс. Те се  възползват от вас, американските потребители.”\r\nРеформи в полицията\r\n“Всички искаме едно и също нещо. Квартали без насилие. Правоохранителни органи, които печелят доверието на общността. Нашите деца да се прибират в безопасност.”\r\n“Равна защита пред закона; това е заветът, който имаме в Америка… Знам, че повечето полицаи са добри, достойни хора. Те рискуват живота си всеки път, когато обличат униформата. Но това, което се случи с Тайър в Мемфис, се случва твърде често. Трябва да се справим по-добре.”\r\nПодкрепа за Украйна\r\n“Ние обединихме НАТО и изградихме глобална коалиция. Застанахме срещу агресията на (руския президент Владимир) Путин.

Чуков.\r\nТой коментира и промените в трафикирането на нелегални мигранти в Европа. Каналджиите вече не получавали пари на ръка, а след свършване на работата. Тарифите стигали до няколко хиляди евро или долара от Турция до крайната дестинация, която най-често е Германия.

Благотворителна организация от Малави, нарекла се Световна федерация на Етиопия, поиска от държавния глава Лазарус Чаквера да започне разследване по отношение на певицата.\r\nПовод за това е станала фондацията на Мадона „Въздигане на Малави“, която тя основава в африканската страна през 2006 г. С дейността си тази организация помага на жители на Европа и САЩ да осиновяват африканчета.\r\n„Необходимо е като предпазна мярка да се ограничи достъпът до Африка и африканските деца на Мадона и нейните сътрудници, докато не бъде проведено разследване за търговия с деца, сексуална експлоатация, сексуално робство, заплаха от принуда, измами и злоупотреба с власт и с уязвимостта на децата“, казва се в изявление на Световната федерация на Етиопия.\r\nЧленовете й също така обвиняват певицата в непристойно поведение с „друго лице от женски пол“, отбелязвайки, че на територията на държавата Малави подобни действия се преследват от закона и се наказват с 5 години лишаване от свобода.\r\nПетицията се позовава и на книгата SEX, издадена от Мадона през 1992 г., която включва „съдържание за възрастни – софт порно и симулации на сексуални действия като садомазохизъм и др.“ Организацията подозира, че под прикритието на своето сиропиталище Raising Malawi и осиновяванията на малавийски деца звездата може да организира трафик на хора и социални експерименти.\r\nПринципът „невинна до доказване на противното“ трябва да важи и в този случай, но има неоспорими факти, които трябва да се вземат предвид по отношение на Мадона, които я правят неподходяща да бъде около деца, камо ли да й бъде дадена възможност да им влияе, изтъкват от Световната федерация. И още: „Ние твърдо вярваме, че Малави е ограбен от най-ценния си ресурс – децата си“.\r\nМадона е обвинявана от федерацията, че използва осиновения си от Малави днес 17-годишен син Дейвид Банда за сексуална експлоатация и социални експерименти. Социалните медии са залети от негови снимки в женски дрехи, с грим и обици, на които двамата с Мадона се държат за ръце като влюбени.\r\nПреди време певицата се похвали, че Дейвид изглежда по-добре в нейните дрехи от нея самата. След поредица обжалвания Върховният съд през 2009 г. дава на Мадона правото да осинови второ дете от Малави – момиченцето Мърси Джеймс, което вече е на 16. През 2017 г. Малави разрешава на певицата да осинови отново и тя става майка на близначките Естер и Стела Мвале, понастоящем почти на 10.\r\nПетицията обвинява правителството на Малави, че не е „направило пълна проверка на социалното минало на осиновителя“ и има причина да се вярва, че Мадона „използва тези деца като социален експеримент в отговор на тежкия натиск на ЛГБТК-общността за содомия в Америка“.\r\nОбвиняват кралицата на попмузиката, че злоупотребява сексуално с осиновените си деца от Африка\r\nСпоред авторите й, благодарение на своите привилегии, пари и слава Мадона се е почувствала над закона и е намерила начин да маневрира извън законите на Малави. Много журналисти критикуват звездата и посочват, че бедността не е причина африкански деца да бъдат отделяни от родителите им и осиновявани в чужбина.\r\nДруги обаче я възхваляват за благотворителната й дейност сред тези семейства и за страната като цяло. Жак Перети, например, пише, че поради нейната щедрост бедните малавийци на практика боготворят Мадона: „Името й... е мутирало в Ma Donor: Даряващата майка. Въпреки това Мадона сама не може да „спаси от бедност“ никоя страна: това би включвало важна икономическа структурна реформа, в която тя не е инвестирала…“."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 693, "end": 702}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1098, "end": 1119}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1216, "end": 1255}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Popularity", "start": 1278, "end": 1333}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 1361, "end": 1448}, {"tag": "Causal_Oversimplification", "start": 1487, "end": 1600}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 1564, "end": 1600}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1578, "end": 1600}], "article_id": "4118", "lang": "bg", "text": "Дейвид Камерън: Има напредък в посока прекратяване на боевете в Газа\r\n\r\nБританският външен министър Дейвид Камерън заяви след обиколка в Близкия изток, че е постигнат напредък в посока договаряне на споразумение за прекратяване на боевете в ивицата Газа и освобождаване на държаните там израелски заложници, предаде Ройтерс.\r\nВ интервю, което даде в Истанбул - последната спирка от обиколката си, Камерън каза, че Израел разглежда британско предложение за отваряне на пристанището в Ашдод за доставки на помощи за крайбрежната палестинска територия, но че \"ще са необходими много усилия\", за да се постигне споразумение.\r\n\"Мисля, че има перспектива за постигането на пауза, при която да спрем сраженията и да започнем да търсим начини за внасяне на помощ и извеждане на заложници\", заяви той пред Ройтерс и турска телевизия. \"Това е, за което говорих в региона.

Твърди се, че 20-30% от бойците на \"Хамас\" в Газа са били убити, но според САЩ групировката, обявена за терористична от ЕС, САЩ, Израел и други държави, разполага с достатъчно оръжие, за да води война още месеци наред, съобщава \"Уолстрийт джърнъл\".\r\nЛидерите на Израел не спират да повтарят, че войната ще продължи, докато не постигнат целите си - осигуряването на безопасността на хората в Израел, унищожаването на Хамас и освобождаването на заложниците, пише АРД.\r\n\"Никой не иска да мисли за мирно решение\"\r\nНе всички в Израел обаче искат сраженията да продължават. В Тел Авив, Йерусалим и други градове почти всеки ден има протести с искания за прекратяване на огъня.\r\nДемонстрантите обикновено обаче не мислят за бъдещето за ивицата Газа и страданието на хората там, а просто искат заложниците да бъдат освободени, разказва АРД. Някои протестират дори пред резиденцията на премиера на Израел Бенямин Нетаняху.\r\nИзраел носи травмата от 7 октомври и това е все по-очевидно в зачестяващите протести на близките на отвлечените от \"Хамас\". \"Ако попитате средностатистическия израелец как се чувства в момента, едва ли някой ще ви заговори за мирни решения\", каза израелският президент Ицхак Херцог на Световния икономически форум в Давос. \"Всеки иска да знае дали може да му бъде обещана сигурност в бъдеще. Всеки човек в Израел иска да е сигурен, че няма да бъде нападнат отново по този начин - от север, юг или изток. Но истината е една - водим война за цялата вселена, за свободния свят\", каза още президентът на Израел.\r\nМоже ли решението за две държави да стане факт?\r\n\"Свободният свят\" обаче вече търси възможности за времето след края на войната, пише АРД. Затова и решението за две държави отново е на дневен ред. Според генералния секретар на ООН Антонио Гутериш за тази цел има едно условие - всички да се съгласят, че палестинците имат право на своя държава. По думите му всяко друго решение би застрашавало мира в Близкия изток.\r\nСАЩ също активно говорят за възможността за основаване на палестинска държава. В Израел и Палестина също има хора, които мислят за бъдещето и как би изглеждал съвместният живот на палестинци и израелци след войната. Те обаче са малцинство.\r\nТъкмо на мястото, където решението за двете държави трябва да бъде приложено на практика, то се отрича, пише АРД. За Хамас отказът от подобен компромис е свързан с отричането на правото на държавата Израел да съществува. Един от политическите лидери на \"Хамас\" - Халед Машаал се обяви за палестинска държава, която да включва и територията на Израел.\r\nУправляващата коалиция на Нетаняху в Израел също не просто иска да предотврати създаването на палестинска държава, но и има свои планове за ивицата Газа след края на войната. Финансовият министър на Израел Безалел Смотрих се изказа в подкрепа на изграждането на нови еврейски селища там, припомня АРД. Итамар Бен-Гвир, министър на националната сигурност, дори иска да принуди палестинското население да емигрира, наричайки идеята си \"доброволна миграция\".\r\nСАЩ се подготвят за времето след Нетаняху\r\nДокато в Израел и в Палестинските територии преобладават пълното отричане или силният скептицизъм по адрес на решението за две държави, на международно ниво вече изглежда има консенсус, че това е най-добрият път напред.\r\nНаскоро дори се появи ново предложение, което включва прекратяване на войната в ивицата Газа, освобождаване на израелските заложници на \"Хамас\", както и на палестинците в израелски затвори. Става дума за споразумения за нормализиране на отношенията на Израел с държави като Саудитска Арабия - в замяна на приемане на решението за две държави, обяснява АРД. Тъй като израелското правителство отхвърля това, във Вашингтон очевидно вече се правят планове за времето след Нетаняху, в случай че правителството му бъде свалено в резултат на войната.\r\nВъпросът кой да води преговори от палестинска страна остава отворен\r\nОстава въпросът кой би могъл да води преговори за реализирането на това решение от името на палестинците. Палестинската автономия не се ползва с почти никакво доверие дори сред собствените си граждани. 88-годишният президент Махмуд Абас според мнозина е корумпиран и слаб. Дори американският държавен секретар Антъни Блинкен наскоро обяви, че Палестинската автономия трябва да бъде напълно реформирана.\r\nБез палестинска държава няма да има реална интеграция на Израел в Близкия изток и сигурност, смята държавният секретар на САЩ. Как ще се случи това с оглед на съпротивата на двете страни, остава неясно. Американският президент Байдън също не даде конкретен отговор на този въпрос.

Зад тези безумни бръщолевения се очертава фигурата на конкретен кукловод - един от най-известните американски олигарси с феноменално влияние. Но какви са истинските му цели?\r\nВ англоезичната преса и социалните мрежи бурно се обсъжда нов лозунг, подхвърлен от радикалните \"зелени\" - \"науката доказва, че децата развалят Земята\". Това, уви, не е шега или дори метафора. Това е идеология. Необходимостта от намаляване на населението на планетата не е нова тема за Запада - тя възниква в псевдонаучни писания още през 60-те години на миналия век, но сега се рекламира широко и откровено, пише \"Труд\".\r\nПрез 1968 г. ентомологът от Станфордския университет Пол Ерлих публикува The Population Bomb. Работата му е рекламирана в медиите, авторът получава всички възможни награди и степени, след което става оратор на множество кампании в защита на абортите, контрацепцията и общото намаляване на раждаемостта. Неговата теория се основава на добре известната идея на Томас Малтус, че пренаселеността води до глад, революции, граждански войни и други катастрофи.\r\nДори през революционната за Запада 1968 г. възгледите на Ерлих звучат доста смело. За да се намали раждаемостта, авторът препоръчва на световните елити да осигурят на всички граждани безплатни презервативи, да гарантират на жените безплатни аборти на всеки етап от бременността, да разрешат „детеубийството“ (убийство на новородени) и насилствена стерилизация.\r\nУжасно бъдеще\r\nАко тези мерки не бъдат приети, твърди авторът, нашата планета я очаква ужасно бъдеще. През 70-те и 80-те години нарастването на световното население, според прогнозите на Ерлих, трябва да доведе до катастрофално покачване на цените на продуктите и ресурсите. Масовият глад, епидемиите, войните трябва да отнемат стотици милиони животи годишно.\r\nТвърде висока цена ли е насилственият аборт, за да се предотврати всичко това? Оттогава броят на хората на Земята се е удвоил, надхвърляйки 7 милиарда. Нито едно от предсказанията на Ерлих не се сбъдва. Но това не му пречи да пише нови книги, обвинявайки човечеството, че окупира планетата и унищожава нейното биологично разнообразие. \r\nЕрлих често е канен във Ватикана на конференции свързани със спасяването на света. Всъщност ентомологът от Станфорд отглежда цяло поколение духовници и ученици, които предлагат на човечеството да се самоунищожи, освобождавайки място за птици и животни.\r\nНо най-активно разработва тази тема \"биоетикът\" Травис Райдър. Той обвинява \"безотговорните\" родители, че децата им допринасят за глобалното затопляне от раждането си. Единственият начин да предотвратим климатична катастрофа е да спрем да имаме деца.\r\nНо ако други автори на ужасяващи истории за пренаселеността използват данни за висока раждаемост в бедните региони на планетата, то Райдър се отнася изключително до „златния милиард“. Именно тези проспериращи хора по световните стандарти той съветва да изоставят раждането на деца \"по морални причини\". Факт е, че в богатите страни на Запада всяко новородено, според Райдър, се превръща в напреднал потребител, още с появата си на бял свят. Консумира памперси, адаптирано мляко, играчки, мокри кърпички и т.н. С всяка такава покупка се увеличава „въглеродният отпечатък“, който едно безотговорно дете оставя в атмосферата.\r\n„Въглероден отпечатък“ е псевдонаучна концепция, измислена от „зелени“ активисти. Отнася се за количеството вредни емисии, попаднали в атмосферата по време на производството, транспортирането и опаковането на всяка наша покупка. Взети заедно, всички наши въглеродни отпечатъци създават парников ефект, променят климата и водят до глобално затопляне. Като имат дете, родителите създават още един „въглероден отпечатък“, извършвайки престъпление срещу планетата. И колкото по-богато е семейството, в което расте детето, толкова по-голям е неговият \"въглероден отпечатък\". \r\nЛобистка политика\r\nПоследният текст на Райдър е публикуван на сайта на един от най-големите медийни холдинги в света NBC – най-старата телевизионна компания в САЩ,  собственост на един от най-известните американски олигарси Браян Робъртс. Произхождащ от богато и религиозно еврейско семейство, в началото на 2000-те той активно лобира за интересите на своя бизнес във Вашингтон. Финансира първо републиканците, а след това и демократите, става „голф приятел“ на Барак Обама и щедро инвестира в президентската му кампания. В замяна Обама и стотина лобисти във Вашингтон позволяват на медийния магнат да сключи две многомилиардни сделки.\r\nЧрез изкупуването на филмови студия, телевизионни компании, вестници, интернет портали и сливането им в огромна холдингова компания, магнатът монополизира производството и доставката на съдържание. За няколко години Робъртс се превръща в един от основните медийни магнати. Аудиторията на NBC е милиарди хора по света. Информационната сила позволява на Робъртс да наложи ценностите си на огромна публика, а ценностите му са типични за глобалистката левица. „Антибяла, антисемейна, антихристиянска пропаганда“ е това, което американските консерватори казват за тях.\r\nРадикалното предложение на биоетика Райдер да не се ражда повече се вписва идеално в тази програма. Появявайки се на сайта на NBC, \"биоетикът\" плавно се влива в глобалния информационен мейнстрийм. Това вече не са бълнувания на луд еколог, а програмен текст, който предлага \"златният милиард\" да измре.

В района по същото време изчезна още един кораб, на който има българи – „Руен“, като се предполага, че той се държи от сомалийци.\r\nХутите обвързват нападенията си с конфликта в Газа и заявяват, че обект на атаките им са кораби, свързани с Израел или такива, които доставят стоки на Израел. „Галакси лийдър“ е собственост на израелски бизнесмен. „Руен“ е собственост на българската компания Параходство БМФ и на него има седем българи като част от екипажа. \r\nТемата на обсъждането по време на заседанието на SEDE беше свързана с ескалацията на ситуацията в Червено море и евентуална операция на ЕС там. Само на 19 януари 2024 г. хутите са извършили 26 нападения на кораби, каза Космин Добран. ЕС одобри да се предприеме широка операция, но подробностите ще се финализират до дни, каза той.  \r\nПо предложение на върховния представител по външна политика Жозеп Борел тя ще се казва ASPIDES, което означава щит. Операцията ще предвижда военни действия за самоотбрана – тази позиция защитава Жозеп Борел пред Саудитска Арабия и ОАЕ, където е на посещение. \r\nВ същото време САЩ, Великобритания и 12 държави членки на ЕС са включени в международна коалиция, която вече действа в Червено море – атакува позиции на хутите. Участието на 12-те страни от ЕС е по тяхна преценка, те са свободни да вземат решение как, уточни Розамария Гили.\r\nЕлена Йончева поиска от представителите на Европейската комисия да обявят какво показват анализите на външната служба – доколко военните операции срещу хутите могат да създадат още по-голяма криза в Газа и дали имат конкретна оценка за икономическите загуби в Европа на този етап от тези военни операции.\r\nРозамария Гили посочи като огромен успех фактът, че във вторник държавите членки на ЕС са се обединили в призив за прекратяване на военните действия в Газа, за защита на цивилните граждани и за предоставяне на хуманитарен достъп до тях.\r\nТя обясни, че хутите не нападат само кораби, свързани с Израел. Икономическите рискове в региона са налице – спад с 40% на приходите, каза Гили. И отбеляза, че корабите, които искат въпреки всичко да минат през протока Баб ел-Мандеб вече имат многократно по-високи разходи за застраховки.\r\nВ дискусията беше отбелязано не веднъж, че ЕС има по-голям икономически интерес от сигурното търговско корабоплаване в региона, отколкото САЩ, защото близо 40% от търговските кораби на съюза минават от там. В същото време опасността от регионална война е реална, според Розамария Гили."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 0, "end": 39}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 27, "end": 39}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 44, "end": 161}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 97, "end": 111}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "start": 291, "end": 522}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 479, "end": 505}], "article_id": "4133", "lang": "bg", "text": "Външният министър на Русия стана за смях\r\n\r\nМинистърът на външните работи на Русия Сергей Лавров предизвика смях със свое изказване във връзка с войната в Украйна.\r\nЛавров присъства на международен икономически форум в Индия, когато опита да изкара Русия като жертва в конфликта с Украйна.\r\nВойната, която се опитваме да спрем, започна срещу нас, използвайки украинския народ, за да се навреди на Русия както в политически, така и в енергиен план, обясни руският дипломат, което предизвика оживление и смях сред аудиторията."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 154, "end": 173}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 296, "end": 363}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 380, "end": 408}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 558, "end": 577}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 778, "end": 797}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 914, "end": 1052}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 1070, "end": 1087}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1171, "end": 1189}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1228, "end": 1242}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1228, "end": 1242}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 1245, "end": 1349}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 1410, "end": 1469}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1936, "end": 1948}], "article_id": "4134", "lang": "bg", "text": "Сийка Милева: През 2022 г. наблюдаваме петкратно увеличение на мигрантския натиск по българо-турската граница\r\n\r\nПрез 2022 г. има петкратно увеличение на незаконната миграция по българо-турската граница в сравнение с 2021 г.

Напоследък предупрежденията му са съсредоточени върху друга нарастваща заплаха за глобалната сигурност: биотероризма.\r\nСпоред Интерпол биотероризмът се отнася до \"умишленото освобождаване на биологични агенти или токсини с цел увреждане или убиване на хора, животни или растения с цел сплашване или принуждаване на правителство или цивилно население за постигане на политически или социални цели\".\r\nСорос, Клаус Шваб и Бил Гейтс: Пъкленият план на кукловодите от Давос ВИДЕО\r\nВ неотдавнашно интервю за Би Би Си британският журналист Амол Раджан попита Гейтс коя според него е голямата бъдеща заплаха пред човечеството, за която не мислим достатъчно.\r\nТъй като започнахме \"да мислим достатъчно за изменението на климата\", отговори Гейтс, това е \"биотероризъм, който е наистина ужасен\".\r\nБиотероризмът и пандемиите са донякъде едни и същи, смята Гейтс, защото излагат човечеството на опасни и дори смъртоносни болести, но \"срещу биотерора е малко по-трудно да се защитиш, защото този, който се опитва да го прилага, го прави съзнателно и разбира защитната ви система, така че може да се опита да я заобиколи\".\r\nВ същото време, Интерпол твърди, че има достатъчно налична информация, която показва, че някои лица и терористични групи имат способността и намерението да използват биологични агенти, за да причинят вреда на обществото.\r\nМеждународната полицейска организация дори е разработила оперативно ръководство за разследване на потенциален биологичен и химически тероризъм в тъмната мрежа, за да подпомогне служителите на разузнаването и следователите по целия свят.\r\nДокато биологичен или токсичен агент вероятно ще се разпространи неочаквано, ефективната реакция на биологично събитие зависи от координацията на няколко сектора участници, твърди Интерпол. \"Затова структурираните стратегии за превенция, готовност и реагиране са от съществено значение\".\r\nЦентровете за контрол и превенция на заболяванията в САЩ твърдят, че ако се случи биотерористична атака, тя най-вероятно ще включва бактерията, причиняваща антракс - заболяване, което може да доведе до тежки заболявания на хора и животни.\r\nСимптомите варират в зависимост от начина, по който бактерията попада в организма - обикновено през кожата, белите дробове или стомашно-чревната система, което определя и вида на заболяването.\r\nСимптомите на кожния антракс, най-често срещаният вид, могат да включват група малки мехури или подутини, които могат да сърбят, както и безболезнени кожни рани с черен център, появяващи се по-често по лицето, шията, ръцете или дланите.\r\nВсички видове антракс могат \"в крайна сметка да се разпространят по цялото тяло и да причинят смърт, ако не се лекуват с антибиотици\".\r\nВдишването на антракс - когато човек вдишва спори на антракс, често е фатално.\r\nАнтраксът вече е бил използван в миналото. През 2001 г. прахообразен антракс е поставен умишлено в писма, изпратени чрез пощенската система на САЩ. Двадесет и двама души, включително 12 пощенски раздавачи, се заразяват с антракс, а петима от тези 22-ма души умират.\r\nДруги биологични оръжия, които потенциално могат да бъдат използвани, са вирусът на вариолата (вирусът, който причинява дребна шарка); сапът, която обикновено засяга конете и вече е била използвана в миналото като биологично оръжие по време на война; и мелиоидозата - инфекциозно заболяване, причинено от микроби, които се срещат в естествено състояние в някои части на света, като Югоизточна Азия и Северна Австралия.\r\nТочно както го направи, когато ни предупреди, че не сме достатъчно подготвени за пандемия преди появата на коронавируса, Гейтс призовава за по-големи инвестиции в технологии за откриване и реагиране на биотерористични атаки.\r\nВ интервю от 2021 г. с бившия министър на здравеопазването на Обединеното кралство Джереми Хънт Гейтс заяви, че се надява до 2026 г. да публикува книга, озаглавена \"Ние СМЕ готови за следващата пандемия\" - и за биологични атаки впоследствие, \"но за това ще са необходими десетки милиарди за научноизследователска и развойна дейност\".\r\nГейтс, петият най-богат човек в света и вторият по големина вносител в Световната здравна организация, смята, че трябва да засилим и международното си сътрудничество и глобалните здравни системи, за да гарантираме, че светът е по-добре подготвен срещу биологични заплахи.\r\nДобрата новина е, че всяка малка част от работата, която вършим, за да се подготвим за бъдещи пандемии, ще бъде \"изключително полезна срещу биотероризма\", каза той пред Би Би Си. Лошата новина е, че \"не сме толкова активни, колкото според мен трябва да бъдем\"."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 8, "end": 46}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 405, "end": 565}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 405, "end": 456}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 433, "end": 445}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 613, "end": 727}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 643, "end": 727}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1342, "end": 1373}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 1794, "end": 1834}, {"tag": "Guilt_by_Association", "start": 1864, "end": 1928}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1905, "end": 1928}], "article_id": "4140", "lang": "bg", "text": "Израел: Няма да има временно примирие с \"Хамас\"\r\n\r\nИзраелски правителствен говорител изключи възможността за временно примирие в Газа и опроверга тиражираните в медиите съобщения за евентуално ново споразумение с \"Хамас\", уредено с чуждестранно посредничество, което да включва спиране на боевете в замяна на освобождаване на заложници.\r\n\"Що се отнася до тиражираната информация за договорки за примирие, Израел няма да се откаже от унищожаването на \"Хамас\", връщането на всички заложници и от премахването на заплахата за сигурността на Израел, произтичаща от Газа\", заяви на брифинг официалният представител.\r\n\"Няма да има спиране на огъня.

Служебното правителство, в което министри бяха Василев и Петков, допусна цената на тока да скочи изключително рязко и не предприеха никакви мерки за компенсиране на бизнеса. Това беше сериозна грешка, която води до високата инфлация и покачването на цените.

Той е автор на книгата “Имплозията - икономически трилър за войната, унищожаването на околната среда и корпоративната алчност” и е съавтор на книгата на Синтия Маккини “Когато Китай киха: От блокирането на коронавируса до глобалната политико-икономическа криза”, пише \"Труд\". \r\nПредателството от страна на политиците на техните сънародници, на самите хора, които им вярват, и които може би са гласували за тях и които плащат с данъците си техните заплати и тяхното препитание, трябва да бъде едно от най-жалките престъпления за човечеството. Толкова е „долно“, че няма дума, която да опише адекватно абсолютната липса на етика, морал и душевност на тези хора.\r\nОсвен, че това са хора бездушни, без етика и без морал. Може да са рядкост, но такива хора и политици ги има. Те са много търсени от олигарсите-елитаристи и майсторите на измамата и на корпоративните финанси, действащи в тъмното, като Дълбоката държава, управляваща чрез техните изпълнителни органи, Вашингтон и Белия дом; Световния икономически форум (СИФ), СЗО, Федералния резерв на САЩ (Фед), ЕС и Комисията на ЕС и накрая чрез Банката за международни разплащания (БМР).\r\nДа напомним, че през 1930-те и 1940-те години БМР насочи американското финансиране към Райхсбанк на Германия (Централната банка), за да се финансира войната на Хитлер срещу Съветския съюз. Днес БМР е буквално Централната банка на почти всички централни национални банки.\r\nКанцлерът на Германия Олаф Шолц и неизбраната, а назначената председателка на Европейската комисия (ЕК) Урсула фон дер Лайен отговарят на профила на такива търсени предатели. На неизвестните кукловеди им бяха необходими наколко месеци, за да проверят кандидатурите на двамата за определените от тях длъжности съответно на канцлер на Германия и председател на Европейската комисия (ЕК).\r\nГоспожата Фон дер Лайен, доказа своята нелоялност към европейския народ, като поръча през септември 2022 г. 4,5 млрд. дози от ваксината на Pfizer за европейско население, което е около 450 милиона или това са около десет инжекции за всеки европеец. Това са милиарди данъчни евро, платени на Pfizer за напълно невалидната и изключително опасната експериментална иРНК инжекция.\r\nИ това, след като главният изпълнителен директор на Pfizer Алберт Бурла открито призна, че вакасината на Pfizer не предотвратява заразяването с „болестта“ на covid, нито разпространението на covid. Той също така призна и за сериозните странични ефекти, които могат да имат тези експериментални инжекции.\r\nВместо незабавно да прекрати всички програми за ваксиниране по света, за да защити това, което е останало от неваксинираните хора, особено децата, бъдещото поколение на човечеството, фон дер Лайен вложи повече „гориво в булдозера“ на ваксините, така че повече хора да страдат, да изгубят имунитета си, да се разболяват и да могат да умрат. Да не говорим за пълната корупция, която се крие зад сделката за 4,5 млрд. дози, която и досега си стои ненаказана. Но Фон дер Лайен си запазва славната си позиция на лицемерие и лъжа.\r\nДнес обаче фокусът е върху канцлерът на Германия Олаф Шолц и неговите предусещания за взривяването на газопроводите „Северен поток“.\r\nКолко предварителни познания имаше канцлерът Шолц за взривяването на „Северните потоци 1 и 2“ на 26 септември 2022 г.?\r\nВъпреки някои отсъстващи уточнения в статията на Сиймор Хърш, по време на съвместна пресконференция на президента Байдън и канцлерът Олаф Шолц в Белия дом на 7 февруари 2022 г., около две седмици преди специалната военна операция (СВО) на Русия срещу Украйна, Джо Байдън каза точно тези думи: „Ако Русия нахлуе, вече няма да има „Северен поток“ и ние ще му сложим края“.\r\nКогато един репортер го попита как точно смята да го направи, като се има предвид, че проектът е под контрола на Германия, Байдън просто каза: „Обещавам, че ние ще успеем да го направим“.\r\nГ-н Шолц, който беше застанал до Байдън, отговори на същия въпрос, като каза нещо като „ние в това сме заедно“.\r\nТази фраза „ние в това сме заедно“ би означавало, че те са говорили и са се съгласили как и по какъв начин да спрат „Северните потоци“. Ако Вие сте немски бизнесмен в производството, който зависи от евтиния руски газ, за да остане конкурентоспособен на международно ниво, или просто сте немски или европейски гражданин, чийто отопление през зимата зависи от руския газ, няма ли тези думи да означават най-голямо предателство от страна на Шолц към немския и европейския народ?\r\nЕвропа зависи около 40% от руския газ. Процентът в Германия през 2021 г. може да е надхвърлил 50%.\r\nНа 22 февруари 2022 г., два дни преди руските военни действия срещу Украйна, канцлерът Шолц отмени завършването на „Северен поток 2“, който по това време трябваше да бъде готов за доставките на руски газ в рамките на около три месеца.\r\nРуската военна намеса срещу постоянната агресия на Украйна срещу 95% на руското население в Донбас, след подбуждания от Запада/САЩ/НАТО преврат през 2014 г. на Майдана, както и срещу десетките финансирани от САЩ лаборатории за биологично оръжие в Украйна се проведе само два дни по-късно, на 24 февруари 2022 г.\r\nИмал ли е Олаф Шолц някакви предварителни познания за датата и времето на руските военни действия?\r\nИма много пропуски или въпроси без отговор в статията на Сиймор Хърш, някои от които бяха изчистени от последващото интервю на Хърш с журналиста Фабиан Шайдлер.\r\nТова, което излезе от този разговор между Хърш и Шайдлър, е, че Гордън Съливан, член на Обединения комитет на началник-щабовете на САЩ, който ръководи „междуведомствена група“, която се събра тайно през декември 2021 г., е да се разберат какви „действия“ да се предприемат, т. е. как да се унищожат тръбопроводите.\r\nЗаместник-държавният секретар Виктория Нюланд - която се помни с фразата „f*ck Europe“ - и която беше дълбоко замесена в прословутия, предизвикан от САЩ/НАТО преврат на Майдана в Украйна през февруари 2014 г. във всяка своя стъпка от тогава до сега, говореше „ние можем да го направим“, което означава унищожаването на тръбопроводите.\r\nОт разговора между Хърш-Шайдлер излиза, че решението за взривяването на газопроводите е взето около 20 януари 2022 г.\r\nТова са думите на Хърш пред Шайдлер: „И тогава президентът, заедно с Олаф Шолц, каза на 7 февруари (има се предвид съвместната пресконференция на Байдън и Шолц), че можем да го направим. Шолц не каза нищо конкретно; той беше неясен.\r\nНо въпросът, който бих задал на Шолц, ако има едно парламентарно изслушване, е следният: президентът Байдън каза ли ви за това? Той каза ли ви тогава защо е толкова уверен, че може да го взриви? Ние все още нямахме план, но знаехме, че имаме способността да го направим“.\r\nНеизбраната председателка на ЕК Урсула фон дер Лайен без никакво съмнение беше напълно съгласна с това решение, което е в ущърб на гражданите на Германия и Европа.\r\nГ-н Шолц също знаеше, че цялостната програма на СИФ/UN 2030 г. включва унищожаване и деиндустриализация на Германия като предшественик на унищожаването на европейската икономика. Той също беше наясно, че немската корпоративна производствена общност и, разбира се, обществеността като цяло са напълно против тези подобни мерки.\r\nОлаф Шолц също много добре знае за тесните връзки, които немската бизнес общност има с Русия и може да е подозирал, дори извън подозренията на САЩ и на ЦРУ, че тези тесни връзки може да намерят начините за достъп до руския газ.\r\nКато послушен ученик на СИФ и на Клаус Шваб, тогава може ли да е твърде пресилено да се спекулира, че самият г-н Шолц може да е дал на Вашингтон, и на администрацията на Байдън, намека за „взривяването“ на тръбопроводите „само за да бъде по-сигурен“?\r\nЗнаейки досега степента на предателството спрямо немския и на европейския народ, казаното за Шолц и фон дер Лайен, разбира се, може да се приеме и за спекулация.

Това обясни лидерът на ГЕРБ Бойко Борисов в живо излъчване във фейсбук. Той бе събрал в централата на ГЕРБ депутатите от формацията си в 49-ото Народно събрание, което ще бъде открито утре. \r\nБорисов обясни, че пенсиите се увеличават с 12,6% от 1 юли. Вече цялата пенсионна система се изкривила. Така според лидера на ГЕРБ тези, които не са се осигурявали, както трябва, получавали почти същата пенсия, като тези, които са го правили. \r\n\"Единственото стабилно дългосрочно правителство е между двете големи партии или двете големи коалиции (ГЕРБ-СДС и ПП-ДБ), защото по същество ние имаме еднакви виждания в 99% от програмите си\", каза Борисов и се обърна към депутатите си: \"Войната между нашите партии беше толкова ожесточена, че съм сигурен сега, като ви гледам физиономиите... да, трябва да си ги прикривате, защото колкото по ми се мръщите, толкова по ме дразните. Но това е дългосрочно и валидно. И по линия на геостратегическата ни ориентация да имаме правителство, което не да предлага МиГ-овете и после да вика \"не, не, ние сме за мир, а другите са военолюбци\". И като изтече информацията от Щатите, да викаме \"оле, майко\".\"\r\nБорисов обясни, че България повече не можела да остане без редовно правителство, като посочи като аргумент военното учение (на Китай) около Тайван и \"реалната война в Украйна\". \r\n\"Макар че ние покачихме резултата си, нищо стабилно не може да се излъчи, без да има национално съгласие и то с партии, които изповядват нашата идеология. А идеологията ни е в подкрепа на Украйна, в подкрепа на намаляване на инфлацията, създаване на условия за бизнес...\", посочи лидерът на ГЕРБ. \r\nТой отново разви тезата си, че бюджет не бива да се приема, ако не бъде избран редовен кабинет. \r\nСпоред него общо правителство между ГЕРБ-СДС и ПП-ДБ щяло да доведе до \"самоконтрол\" и това щяло да е \"най-голям гарант за превенция срещу корупцията\". \r\n\"Има и други варианти, има и други варианти, но там имаме две много ясни разделителни линии относно Украйна и къде се намираме в Европа, и съответно по темата, ако щете, Северна Македония, и също за войната. Като се има предвид че \"Възраждане\" си покачват резултата и с цялото си самочувствие заслужено казват \"ние можем да търпим дотогава, докато не станем първа политическа сила, да имаме самостоятелно правителство\" - не че ще се случи, но така те пазят своя електорат\", обясни Бойко Борисов. \r\n\"Има такъв народ\" пък заявили, че ще имат роля на \"държавен и партиен контрол\". \r\n\"ДПС са готови, съответно, да управляват винаги и оставаме ние и колегите от ПП.

Без нас правителство не може да има. Готови сме, диалогични сме, разбираме, поставяме България над всичко. Единственото, което искаме, е към нас да се отнасят с уважение заради огромната армия, която стои зад нас, от гласоподаватели. Мисля, че е заслужено. Мисля, че е ясно. Бихме ги заедно, победихме ги поотделно и с машини, и с хартии, и смесено гласуване - каквото искате. Имаме правото, имаме самочувствието да искаме диалогично България да се управлява по-добре.

Войната, която се води вече девет години в Йемен, изглежда далечна, пише АРД в репортаж от арабската страна.\r\nНа влизане в града се вижда голям флаг - този на Южен Йемен, който демонстрира желанието на въоръжените групировки, които контролират Шибам, да се отцепят от северната част на страната, която се управлява от бунтовниците хути.\r\nХората от региона, в който се намира град Шибам, от години са враждебно настроени към хутите. В последно време обаче някои преосмислят позицията си, пише АРД. Един от тях е Мохамед Файзал, който е туристически гид. Заради войната той почти няма работа - вече почти никой не посещава Шибам, въпреки че градът е включен в списъка на световното наследство на ЮНЕСКО.\r\nПоддръжниците на хутите са непреклонни\r\nНа 500 километра западно от Шибам е разположена столицата на Йемен - Сана, където хутите управляват от 2014 година насам. Хасан Абдала е поддръжник на хутите. Той е представител на шиитското разклонение заиди, разказва АРД, цитирана от Deutsche Welle.\r\nАбдала и други поддръжници на хутите се събират в джамия в Сана, където проповедник ги насърчава да не се отказват въпреки въздушните удари, които САЩ и съюзниците им нанасят. \"Ние вече сме преживели девет години въздушни нападения, те са ни направили само по-силни\", казва и Абдала. Гражданската война в Йемен се води от 2014 година насам, а Саудитска Арабия неведнъж е бомбардирла позициите на хутите.\r\nОт 7 октомври, когато палестинската групировка Хамас нападна Израел, Абдала протестира всеки петък след молитвата. Десетки хиляди поддръжници на хутите демонстрират солидарността си с хората в ивицата Газа и се противопоставят на Израел и САЩ. Основното им послание е едно: \"Няма да позволим дори на големите сили да ни сломят\".\r\nХутите искат да бъдат възприемани като защитници на Газа\r\nВече две седмици Йемен е бомбардиран, този път от военна коалиция, водена от САЩ, която извършва удари по позиции на хутите в страната. Те обаче изглежда нямат намерение да спрат набезите си срещу търговските кораби, преминаващи през Червено море. САЩ смята хутите за терористична организация, но в арабския свят те трупат одобрение като военен опонент на най-близкия съюзник на Израел - Вашингтон.\r\nВоенизираната организация иска да спре търговията на израелското пристанище Ейлат, а целта им е да бъдат възприемани като защитници на палестинската кауза. Хутите умишлено правят пряка връзка между войната в ивицата Газа и конфликта в Червено море, казва анализаторът Хишам Ал Омейси пред АРД. \"Те настояват да бъде прекратен огънят в Газа, за да спрат с нападенията в Червено море\", посочва още експертът. Ал Омейси казва, че хутите могат да ограничат нападенията временно, но в дългосрочен план те ще останат заплаха за региона.\r\nМакар и разделени, жителите на Йемен подкрепят палестинците\r\nМеждувременно слънцето в Шибам е залязло, продължа разказа Рамин Сина от АРД. Мохамед Файзал, туристическият гид, играе домино с приятелите си в едно улично кафене. Обсъждат политиката, Файзал чука по дъската за домино и казва, че Йемен е игрална дъска за чужди сили. Мъжете около него кимат.\r\nДори доскорошните врагове на хутите в Южен Йемен сега ги подкрепят в конфликта със САЩ. Според екскурзовода Мохамед Файзал от Шибам палестинската кауза е по-важна. \"Ние сме една кръв. Съчувстваме им - това не е война срещу една държава, а срещу целия арабски свят.\"\r\nПочти никой от хората в южния град не смята, че враждуващите фракции в Йемен ще се обединят заради конфликта в Близкия изток, добавя АРД. Хутите имат съвсем различни интереси от хората в Шибам.

Руските и украинските медии, разказващи безумната версия, не посочват източник за твърденията си.\r\nШукшина, която е по-голямата дъщеря на известния съветски актьор, кинорежисьор и писател Василий Шукшин и на актрисата Лидия Федосеева-Шукшина, смята, че е разкрила опасен американски план, а пандемията от коронавирус нарича „американска инфекциозно-военна специална операция“, описва конспиративната история „Обозреватель“.\r\nСпоред 55-годишната актриса, COVID-19 е бил измислен, за да се изобрети впоследствие ваксина срещу вируса, с която после да бъдат унищожени руснаците, които се ваксинират с нея. Шукшина е открила, че по този начин ракетната система за залпов огън HIMARS се насочва към руските казарми, в които са струпани ваксинирани и ги поразява – военни и цивилни.\r\n„Това, което започна през 2020 г., беше началото на американската инфекциозно-военна спецоперация. Първо се измисля определен вирус, след това от него се разработва лекарство-ваксина, което не прави нищо друго, освен да остави чип с координати, качени в сателит.\r\nИ тогава с помощта на този спътник са насочват американски оръжия – те поразяват казармите и цивилното население, което се поддаде на провокацията и си инжектира „Спутник“, цитира теорията на Шукшина „Обозреватель“.\r\nАктрисата смята, че изводите й са съвсем очевидни. Тя се чуди защо трябва да обяснява толкова прости неща на публиката. Като антиваксърка Мария се опитала да попречи на населението да бъде ваксинирано, „но Big Pharma и СЗО вече имали повече власт“.\r\nТвърденията, приписвани на Шукшина предизвикаха бурни дискусии в руския и украинския сегменти на социалните мрежи. „Значи излиза, че HIMARS унищожават руснаци по заповед на самите руснаците?\r\nМоже би няма HIMARS? Натискат бутон в Пентагона и ваксинираните се взривяват на правилното място?“, коментират потребители. „Татко й пиеше много.

Още в първите дни на 2023 г. фармакологичните компании побързаха да обявят, за пореден и определено непоследен път, че „новият вариант на последния вариант, наричан галено „Омикрон”, е много по-заразен от предходните варианти”. Особено в контекста на случващото се сега (пак) в Китай, началото на т.г. подозрително много напомня на началото на 2020 г., когато светът още не подозираше какво го чака откъм спорни медицински политики, локдауни, протоколи, изкривяване на информация и страховито ежедневно обявяване на броя на починалите като при война.\r\nЕ, любимият на всички интелектуалци персонаж на Алеко Константинов, чието име мнозина обичат да „лепят” на свои сънародници за щяло и не щяло като нарицателно – „Бай Ганя”, казваше от самото начало – досега никой не е броил колко хора умират годишно от грип. Казваше и още, че локдауните са безсмислени, а маските не помагат. Изтъкваше, че е променен начинът, по който се изчислява дали има епидемия, или не. Категоричен беше, че \"зеленият сертификат\" е негативно явление. Отказваше да се ваксинира.\r\nА кой крив – кой прав: Ганя или ентусиаст-медико-последователите, историята ще покаже.\r\nТова, че има „нов вариант”, открит наскоро, изобщо не е новина. Всъщност този наратив сам по себе си отдавна не е новина. Интересен в случая е фактът, че чрез проследяване на информацията в мрежата и по медиите може сравнително лесно да се разкрие природата на пропагандния наслов, през който живяхме в последните близо 3 години. И още повече – как точно в един момент заживява свой собствен живот.\r\nПисали сме за „Прозореца на Овертон” – как лесно и последователно общественото мнение може да се манипулира в посока, желана от този, който практикува манипулацията. Писали сме и за Фалшивата двоичност – тези текстове можете да прочетете в линковете.\r\nСега обаче с „новия вариант”, който неизбежно е „по-опасен” – въпреки че между „опасен” и „заразен” има драстична разлика, става ясно друго. Вирусът и всичко, свързано с него, напомня за самоуправляващите се коли – има шофьор, обаче е пасивен наблюдател, който се намесва само ако има проблем. Как иначе хилядите учени ще оправдаят грантовете си, ако не намерят „нов вариант”? Дори не е нужно да си дават и толкова зор – всъщност сега достатъчно много хора вярват все още в тях, че биха погълнали безрезервно всяка информация, която „експертите” им сервират наготово.\r\nА вярата е интересно нещо. Както мнозина смятат, че е казал Марк Твен – „По-лесно е да излъжеш хората, отколкото да ги убедиш, че са били лъгани”. В тази сентенция има много истина. Защото в контекста на сегашния „нов вариант”, дори ако същите тези „експерти” излязат по националната телевизия тази вечер в извънредна емисия и кажат, че цялата пандемия е била абсолютна лъжа с цел дистрибуция на капитала, никой няма да им повярва.\r\nТочно такава е и крайната цел на пропагандата – машината да бъде толкова добре смазана, че сама да се задвижва и сама да генерира енергия. Този процес, конкретно в случая на пандемяита, бе ускорен до такава степен, че все едно беше на забързан кадър, за разлика от другия подобен наратив, свързан с климатичните промени. Така в рамките само на няколко месеца в средата на 2020 г. се създаде цяла клика от хора, чиято функция в обществото зависи изцяло от това да има и да се говори за COVID.

Според учените тази безпрецедентна жега се дължи на климатичната криза и появата на явлението Ел Ниньо в Тихия океан, свързано с по-високи температури.

Защото дълги години той експлоатираше имиджа си на офицер от КГБ – на студен и разумен човек, способен да пресмята какви биха били последствията. Сега виждаме нещо съвсем различно. Сега той е обзет от волята да твори зло.\r\nСамата идея, че Украйна не съществува, е част от реториката на сталинската държава. Тезата, която сега пробутва Путин, че светът ни е длъжен след Втората световна война, също е сталинска теория. Такова ожесточение, с каквото Русия се противопоставя днес на Запада, не е имало дори по време на Студената война. Няма да се изненадам, ако скоро прекръстят Волгоград отново на Сталинград и в Русия пак започнат да се издигат паметници на Сталин.\r\nНо в какво се състои най-големият страх на печалния руски президент. В неговата книжка с възпоменания има един интересен момент от 1989 г. в Германия, когато в Дрезден той служи като резидент от КГБ. Тогава няколко хиляди жители на Дрезден обкръжават сградата на ЩАЗИ, където бяха държани и политическите затворници, а недалеч от тази сграда се намира и вилата на КГБ, където е работел Путин. И той пише, че през цялото време те чакали инструкции, а Москва мълчала.\r\nСпоред мен за него моментът, в който източногерманците, които той смяташе за втора ръка хора, изведнъж въстават и се вдигат на бунт по умен начин, точно както биха действали професионалистите от спецслужбите, е доста травматичен. Те обкръжиха сградата на ЩАЗИ, поставиха патрули, така че да не бъдат изнасяни никакви документи от сградата и в продължение на 3 дни принудиха ръководството на ЩАЗИ да се предаде.\r\nТова е основният страх на Путин – че тези, които той е свикнал да смята за не субекти и за някакви твари, изведнъж се превръщат в исторически и политически субект и имат право на самоопределение. И в този смисъл, когато украинското общество показа, че е способно да се съпротивлява и да устоява на натиска, за руския лидер това представлява екзистенциална опасност от много високо ниво..."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 253, "end": 288}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 412, "end": 483}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 773, "end": 780}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 897, "end": 918}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 930, "end": 939}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 930, "end": 939}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1032, "end": 1057}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1136, "end": 1159}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1136, "end": 1159}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1339, "end": 1363}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1339, "end": 1363}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1387, "end": 1406}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1387, "end": 1406}], "article_id": "4169", "lang": "bg", "text": "600% увеличение: Търсенето на секс с украинки\r\n\r\nТърсенето на сексуални услуги от украинки се е увеличило с 600% от началото на войната.

И все пак в нито един друг момент от мандата на фон дер Лайен коалицията на ЕС за климата не е изглеждала толкова крехка.\r\nПовечето партии и политици подкрепят целта на Европа за климатична неутралност до 2050 г. Но мерките за постигане на този крайъгълен камък са все по-често атакувани, пише \"Политико\".\r\nЗагрижеността за енергийната сигурност засили аргументите за възобновяемите енергийни източници миналата година, но нарастващите разходи карат някои да призовават за по-бавно темпо на законодателството в областта на климата - или да подражават на Закона за намаляване на инфлацията в САЩ с неговите щедри субсидии, вместо да добавят повече нови правила.\r\nНарастващият брой екологични регулации в ЕС “е огромен проблем”, каза германският евродепутат Петер Лизе, екологичен говорител на ЕНП. “Важно е да не изискваме твърде много.”\r\nТези призиви се засилиха през пролетта, когато една фермерска партия спечели холандските провинциални избори на фона на протести срещу новите правила за емисиите.\r\nУплашена, ЕНП - която се смята за основен защитник на интересите на селските райони - стартира кампания срещу елементи от Зелената сделка, насочени към селското стопанство. Това стана цел на водещия закон на ЕС за възстановяване на природата, предложение, ключово за стимулиране на естествените въглеродни поглътители на континента.\r\nВъпреки че ЕНП едва не успя да отхвърли закона миналата седмица, тя успя да го отслаби - например напълно премахна целите за възстановяване на влажните зони. Групата наскоро успя да смекчи и други законопроекти, като новите правила за емисиите от животновъдните ферми.\r\n“Разбира се, заглавието е, че ЕНП се провали, но ако погледнете измененията, които бяха приети, тогава Тимерманс и социалистът водещият евродепутат се провалиха”, каза Лизе. “Не е останало много от това, което искаха.” \r\nКомисията, изглежда, е била наказана от яростната реакция на нейния закон за природата; той излезе само с необвързващи цели за закон за почвата, който също си навлече гнева на ЕНП.\r\nМного евродепутати виждат битката около Закона за възстановяване на природата като разрив. Тонът беше много по-груб от всеки друг законодателен дебат за Зелената сделка, като ЕНП се оттегли от преговорите и беше изправена пред обвинения, че разпространява подвеждащи твърдения.\r\nЛизе каза, че “разочарованието се е натрупало” в ЕНП поради усещането, че нейните възгледи са игнорирани от други групировки, а по-суровата реторика е “необходима стратегия за промяна на духа в комисията по околна среда”.\r\nМеждувременно вътрешната политика все повече задържа зеленото законодателство в Съвета тази година, от Германия, която почти блокира спирането на автомобилите с двигатели с вътрешно горене, до Франция, която отлага законодателството за възобновяеми енергийни източници, за да получи концесии за ядрена енергия."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 0, "end": 66}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 71, "end": 191}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 100, "end": 109}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 126, "end": 191}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 197, "end": 306}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Authority", "start": 537, "end": 742}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 582, "end": 600}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 824, "end": 915}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 943, "end": 980}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1024, "end": 1043}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 1074, "end": 1172}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1074, "end": 1172}, {"tag": "Consequential_Oversimplification", "start": 1176, "end": 1351}], "article_id": "4183", "lang": "bg", "text": "След като COVID заглъхна, \"Модерна\" се насочи към ваксини срещу рак\r\n\r\nСпециалистите от компанията \"зарибяват\" с доводите, че ако станат задължителни, животите на милиони хора ще бъдат спасени.\r\n\r\nЖивотът на милиони хора може да бъде спасен от набор от нови ваксини за редица заболявания, включително ракови, съобщиха експерти от британската фармацевтичната компания \"Модерна\".\r\nВодещата компания, базирана в Кембридж, изрази увереност, че първите дози срещу рак, сърдечносъдови и автоимунни заболявания ще бъдат готови до 2030 година.\r\nРезултатите от изследванията на ваксините са много обнадеждаващи, по думите на експертите, които казват също, че бързият и голям напредък е постигнат благодарение на успеха на вече създадената Ковид ваксина.\r\nДоктор Пол Бъртън, директор на \"Модерна\", заяви за „Гардиън“, че е убеден, че фирмата ще може да предложи лечение за всички видове проблематични заболявания до пет години.\r\nФирмата, която създаде една от успешните ваксините срещу Ковид, разработва ваксини срещу различни видове злокачествени тумори.\r\nДоктор Бъртън каза още, че само с една инжекция хората ще могат да бъдат предпазвани срещу множествените респираторни инфекции.\r\nНякои учени предупредиха, че големият напредък в областта на ваксините, постигнат напоследък, може лесно да бъде пропилян, ако не се поддържа високо ниво на инвестиции в бранша."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 86, "end": 94}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 139, "end": 151}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 530, "end": 638}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 833, "end": 983}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 1511, "end": 1630}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 3144, "end": 3395}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3202, "end": 3226}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 3246, "end": 3252}], "article_id": "4184", "lang": "bg", "text": "Изследване: Хазяите в Бургас и Варна не дават жилищата си на украинци или им поставят непосилни условия\r\n\r\nУкраинските граждани у нас имат тежки бариери пред наемането на жилища в България, особено в морските градове.

Емил Мингов.\r\n„По отношение програмата „Солидарност“ трябва съответното лице да се обърне към Агенцията по заетостта. Такова обръщане няма. Имаме съвсем редки случаи. Защото ако в крайна сметка лицето се регистрира в Агенцията по заетостта, то със средствата, които са по програма „Солидарност“, ще се субсидира заетостта и фактически там, където той ще започне работа, ще има средства, за да може да си позволи наемането на квартира и да може да се устрои, така да се каже. Но няма интерес към програмата, което за мен е много чудно. Нямам отговор на въпроса защо и по какъв начин, при положение че нямаме недостиг на средства по програмата. Има достатъчно средства за всички, които желаят. В момента около 9 хиляди имаме в България, от които общо взето една трета дори не са се регистрирали“, каза проф. Мингов.\r\nЗам.-министърът добави: „Забележете, една част от тези украински граждани са жени с малки деца, които са настанени в хотелите, където не е близко местоработата, дори и ако им я предложат, и те поставят въпроса: „Добре, по какъв начин ние ще можем да започнем работа по програмата, ако децата не са устроени в детски ясли, детски градини или пък в училищата, да осигурят транспорта за отиване и връщане“. Разбира се, за да не попаднем в положението на омагьосан кръг, би трябвало ако лицата получат средствата, с които фактически работодателят и държавата ще ги даде, да могат да наемат в градовете, където работата им е близко и за това нещо се води и разяснителна кампания сред тях. Да, вярно е, че имаме и езикова бариера, но в крайна сметка аз мисля, че това, което обясняват и прикрепените към групите преводачи, могат да свършат това нещо. Така че аз мисля, че от тази гледна точка може би ще видим какъв е резултатът другата седмица, за да може да видим какъв е интересът, за да можем да ви докладваме.“\r\nВ следващия момент думата взе Бойчо Арнаудов – директор на Националния превантивен механизъм към омбудсмана на Република България: „Искам просто да се изкажа кратко по този въпрос и да ви кажа защо украинците не могат да се включат по тази програма. Според едно скорошно изследване на Върховния комисариат за бежанците основният проблем на украинците е да си намерят жилище, където да живеят. Изключително трудно си намират жилище под наем, особено по морските градове, Варна и Бургас, лятно време. Като чуят, че са украинци, отказват да им дадат жилището, завишават наема непосилно или искат някакви безумни депозити от 4, 5, 6 месеца и последното, което е, искат българин да подпише договора за наем – той да наеме апартамента като един вид гаранция.

Привидно хуманна инициатива, идеята всъщност представлява връх на бюрократичното невежество. Защото докато за град като София този проблем действително съществува и трябва да бъде решен, то за Бургас... меко казано е абсурдно да говорим за бездомни кучета. \r\nТук поне от 2008 г. насам е на практика невъзможно, поне в централната градска част, да се види безстопанствено четириного, а какво остава за глутниците, характерни за някои жилищни комплекси в столицата. Причината за това е проста – администрацията на кмета Димитър Николов още в първия мандат (2007-2011 г.) взе строги мерки и проведе дълга кампания срещу бездомните кучета, които към онзи момент бродеха улиците ден и нощ. И така – повече от 10 години по-късно, тук този проблем е решен.\r\nТова не пречи на ЕС да изисква от нас сега да проведем нова кампания по кастрация и залавяне на несъществуващите бездомни кучета. Във връзка с това, привидно чисто протоколно, зам.-кметът по „Стратегическо развитие и екология, дигитализация и адаптация към промените на климата“ Весна Балтина е входирала докладна записка към Общинския съвет, която предстои да се разгледа на предстоящата идната седмица редовна сесия. Документът се изисква от ЕС, защото иначе няма как да се покаже участието ни в поредната приумица на Брюксел.\r\nВ нея тя описва нуждата от „трайно намаляване на популацията, съгласно разпоредбите на действащото законодателство“, като това ще се постигне чрез ефективен подход на масова кастрация. Нещо повече – има и изготвен план за действие, в който са заложени конкретни мерки, които да доведат до успешното приключване на поставените от европейските бюрократи цели.\r\nПовече от това не е нужно да се казва. Ако утре на Брюксел му щукне да изработи план за борба с вятърните мелници, страните-членки вероятно ще трябва да изградят стратегия и срещу тях. По всичко личи, че кракът на нито един от умовете в условната столица на Европейския съюз явно не е стъпвал в Бургас, за да види реалността тук, на терен. Защото ако беше, щеше да знае, че борба за „овладяване на популацията“ на бездомните кучета тук не е необходима, защото проблемът бе решен преди повече от 10 години. \r\nКакво би казал ЕС за гларусите, които заради разрастването на градовете по бреговете на Европа се е превърнал във вредител №1? Нехуманно е да се контролира тяхната популация. Не е цивилизовано да разменяме връзка с гларусови крачета за футболна топка.\r\nА какво би казал за бездомните котки, които не по-малко от несъществуващите кучета по улиците на Бургас разнасят болести и замърсяват градската среда? Не, котките ги оставете, те са хубави и не представляват проблем.\r\nМоже би е редно да контролираме популацията на комарите? Да, ама нали през 2021 година забраниха на Общината да ползва самолета, който се ползваше за пръскане на най-големите им развъдници – в Атанасоското и Бургаското езеро. Явно комарите също не са проблем, нищо, че вече започнаха да ни хапят от ранна пролет до късна есен, вместо само лятото.\r\nВажното за ЕС е всички държави-членки да играят по свирката на Брюксел. Каже ли той, че ще трепем вятърните мелници – ще ги трепем, та пушек ще се вдига. Няма значение има ли проблем, няма ли – изпълняваме, за да ни е мирна главата. А какво ще реши брюкселският бюрократ утре? Можем само да гадаем. Загадка остава и кой ще плаща за масовата кастрация на несъществуващи бездомни кучета в Бургас.

Виждам вече нарастваща обществена подкрепа и също така и експертна, защото следя темата много внимателно“, съобщи Инджев, който забелязва, че има все повече български историци, които застават на тази позиция.\r\nЖурналистът вярва, че, особено в светлината на руската агресия срещу Украйна, е дошъл денят националният празник на страната ни да бъде променен. „Просто е пълно безумие да гласуваме за всички европейски западни санкции срещу Русия, а да ги тачим на националния си празник. Отгоре на всичко им даваме повод те да си развяват националното знаме, за което твърдя, че те един ден ще сменят, когато приключи тази трагедия“, смята той.\r\nИнджев коментира, че именно първата стъпка на руснаците, обявили се против войната и режима на Владимир Путин, е знамето, от което след инвазията в Украйна, премахнаха червения цвят, заменяйки го с бял.\r\n„Това е първата стъпка и аз съм сигурен, че тя ще бъде последвана от следваща, защото няма как Путин да спечели тази война срещу 54 държави, които подкрепят Украйна.\r\nТова са 54 високоразвити държави, така наречената коалиция „Рамщайн“, и е абсолютно невъзможно да си представи човек, че Русия с нейния по-малко от 2% Брутен вътрешен продукт (БВП) от икономиката на планетата, да победи обединения Запад и държавите, които подкрепят Украйна“, подчерта той и заключи, че рано или късно ще бъдем свидетели на край, който ще бъде драматичен за онези, които започнаха войната."}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Slogans", "start": 15, "end": 50}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 55, "end": 90}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 452, "end": 478}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 594, "end": 660}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 594, "end": 660}, {"tag": "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "start": 712, "end": 831}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1051, "end": 1097}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1175, "end": 1185}, {"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 1503, "end": 1528}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 1992, "end": 2006}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 2022, "end": 2043}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2636, "end": 2821}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 2869, "end": 2886}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 2941, "end": 3097}, {"tag": "Conversation_Killer", "start": 3100, "end": 3105}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 3335, "end": 3355}], "article_id": "4188", "lang": "bg", "text": "Клаус Йоханис: Румъния е била и ще остане с Украйна\r\n\r\nРумъния е била и ще остане с Украйна, заяви президентът Клаус Йоханис в двореца Котрочени в Букурещ на годишната среща с ръководителите на дипломатическите мисии, акредитирани в страната, съобщават румънските медии.

Йоханис изрази надежда, че Румъния скоро ще може да увеличи своя принос като държава членка на Шенген и чрез присъединяването със сухопътните граници.

В това отношение най-значимите \"етапи\", по думите му, са: приемането на регионалните планове за отбрана, засилването на присъствието на НАТО на източния фланг, потвърждаването на стратегическото значение на Черно море.\r\n\"Ние ще продължим вътрешните усилия за изпълнение на ангажиментите на страна домакин и ще продължим тясната координация със съюзниците, особено Съединените щати и Франция, за да осигурим засилена отбрана\", обясни Клаус Йоханис. Той определи 2024 като важна година за стратегическото партньорство между Румъния и Съединените щати.\r\nВъв връзка с конфликта в Близкия изток румънският президент изрази подкрепата си за решение за две държави, така че законните стремежи на палестинския народ, както и правото на сигурност на държавата Израел, да бъдат зачетени.\r\n„Що се отнася до събитията в Близкия изток, категорично осъдих атаката на \"Хамас\" от първия момент и в същото време пледирах за стриктно спазване на международното право, включително международното хуманитарно право, чрез предоставяне на хуманитарна помощ на цивилни в Газа.

На Русия ѝ бяха наложени безпрецедентни в съвременната история икономически санкции (заради окупацията на украинския полуостров Крим през 2014 г. и войната на Москва срещу Украйна, започнала на 24 февруари 2022 г.).

Два часа празни приказки, а сме тук, за да свършим определена работа. Нелегалната миграция и трафикът на мигранти очевидно е огромен проблем. Заля България в последните два месеца. Служебният кабинет има своите отговорности, трябва да отговаря на много въпроси защо това е така. Но законодателният орган също има своите отговорности.\r\nОсвен с часове да говорите и да използвате трибуната за политическите разправии, трябва да приемаме закони - така пише в Конституцията и затова е създаден парламентът.\r\nЗаконите, внесени от “БСП за България“, които касаят трафик на мигранти - стоят втори месец непокътнати. За пореден път се обръщам към председателя на правната комисия Радомир Чолаков с искане тези закони да бъдат придвижени.\r\nВ тази система от мерки, които трябва да вземат всички институции в страната, има нещо, което е много важно и се казва превенция. Знаете ли, че тези, които ги залавят като помагачи и каналджии се отървават или с условни присъди, или с административни глоби? Наше задължение е да променим този закон.\r\nОт становища на съда и прокуратурата става ясно, че тези институции остават с вързани ръце заради сега действащите закони. Казват ни, че заради законите трябва или да ги пуснат, или да бъдат условно осъдени. Но направиха предложения - да увеличим наказанията, да се отнема превозното средство, с което се превозват тези трафиканти и редица мерки, които “БСП за България“ внесе преди два месеца. Досега щяхме да сме забравили за това.\r\nСамо утежняването на наказанията и превенцията няма да решат въпроса, но други институции отговарят за приложението на закона. Нашата отговорност е да приемем този закон. За осми път апелирам - вкарайте тези предложения в правна комисия и да знаем, че ние, като законодателен орган, сме си свършили работата.\""}, {"annotations": [{"tag": "Name_Calling-Labeling", "start": 0, "end": 16}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 20, "end": 45}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 20, "end": 45}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 20, "end": 45}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 34, "end": 45}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 103, "end": 122}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 381, "end": 427}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 381, "end": 502}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 381, "end": 427}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 415, "end": 427}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 449, "end": 502}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 464, "end": 502}, {"tag": "Doubt", "start": 506, "end": 568}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 548, "end": 568}, {"tag": "Repetition", "start": 617, "end": 661}, {"tag": "Slogans", "start": 617, "end": 661}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 670, "end": 757}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "start": 670, "end": 757}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 798, "end": 855}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 836, "end": 855}, {"tag": "Whataboutism", "start": 858, "end": 1047}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 1174, "end": 1263}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1513, "end": 1750}, {"tag": "Appeal_to_Values", "start": 1753, "end": 1968}, {"tag": "Loaded_Language", "start": 2077, "end": 2096}, {"tag": "Flag_Waving", "start": 2108, "end": 2191}, {"tag": "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "start": 2108, "end": 2191}, {"tag": "Questioning_the_Reputation", "start": 2196, "end": 2274}], "article_id": "4191", "lang": "bg", "text": "Румънски Копейкин : ЕК се води от болни мозъци\r\n\r\nСпоред Джордже Симион ръководената от него партия е „най-живото движение“ в страната.\r\n\r\nЛидерът на румънската националистическа партия „Алианс за единство на румънците“ (AUR) Джордже Симион критикува Европейския съюз в реч при представянето на кандидатите на партията за изборите за Европейски парламент догодина.

Това става ясно от последната сводка на Върховния комисариат за бежанците към ООН, според която 2/3 от дошлите у нас украинци са предпочели да се преместят в друга държава. Данните към 3 януари сочат, че броят на украинските бежанци в Европа вече доближава плътно 8 млн. (точно 7 915 287), като в националните програми за временна защита и подкрепа са включени 4 905 293 украинци. \r\nОт началото на войната границата със съседни страни са преминали 17 139 782 души от Украйна, а в обратно направление - 9 180 679. Най-много бежанци са приели Полша (1 553 707) и Германия (1 021 667).

Оказва се, че най-масово те напускат България - в момента у нас се намират 51 140 украинци, т.е. 97 311 (65.6%, или почти 2/3) от потърсилите временно убежище тук, са предпочели да отидат в други страни. Няма друга държава, от която толкова масово да \"се спасяват\" бежанците от Украйна. ООН всъщност отчита отлив на украинци само в още две други европейски страни - от Хърватия са напуснали 4971 от пристигналите 19 968, от Латвия - 9609 от дошлите 44 587 души. За сравнение - всички пристигнали в Полша и Германия са останали в тези държави. Същото се отнася до повечето други европейски страни, като в останалите броят на постоянно приютените украинци е по-голям от първоначално регистрираните - т.е. са напуснали първата държава, в която са пристигнали. \r\nТакъв е случаят със Словакия, Румъния, Чехия, Белгия, Дания, Черна гора, Италия и т.н. \r\nПАРАДОКСИ. \r\nСъщевременно статистиката на ООН отчита, че най-голям брой украински граждани са регистрирани като бежанци в...
